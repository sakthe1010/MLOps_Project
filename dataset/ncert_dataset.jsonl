You havealso studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc.Let us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a lineare given in a plane.\nSo, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given\nin Fig. 10.1 below:\nFig. 10.1\nIn Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case,\nPQ is called a non-intersecting  line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there\nare two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we\ncall the line PQ a secant  of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point \nA which\nis common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the\ncircle.CIRCLES\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 145\nYou might have seen a pulley fitted over a well which is used\nin taking out water from the well. Look at Fig. 10.2. Here the rope\non both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent\nto the circle representing the pulley.\nIs there any position of the line with respect to the circle\nother than the types given above? You can see that there cannotbe any other type of position of the line with respect  to the circle.In this chapter, we will study about the existence of the tangentsto a circle and also study some of their properties.\n10.2 Tangent to a Circle\nIn the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that\nintersects the circle at only one point .\nTo understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform\nthe following activities:\nActivity 1 :  Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the\ncircular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table\nand gently rotate the wire AB about the point P\n to get different positions of the straight\nwire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].\nIn various positions, the wire intersects the\ncircular wire at P and at another point Q1 or Q2 or\nQ3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will\nintersect the circle at the point P only (see position\nAB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at\nthe point P of the circle. On rotating further, youcan observe that in all other positions of AB, it willintersect the circle at P and at another point, say R\n1\nor R2 or R3, etc. So, you can observe that there is\nonly one tangent at a point of the circle .\nWhile doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB\nmoves towards the position A  B, the common point, say Q1, of the line AB and the\ncircle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides\nwith the point P in the position A B of AB. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is\nrotated rightwards about P? The common point R3 gradually comes nearer and nearer\nto P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:\nThe tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end\npoints of its corresponding chord coincide .Fig. 10.3 (i)Fig. 10.2\n*The word ‘tangent’ comes from the Latin word ‘tangere’, which means to touch and was\nintroduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n146 MATHEMA TICS\nActivity 2 :  On a paper, draw a circle and a\nsecant PQ of the circle. Draw various lines\nparallel to the secant on both sides of it. Y\nou\nwill find that after some steps, the length ofthe chord cut by the lines will graduallydecrease, i.e., the two points of intersection ofthe line and the circle are coming closer andcloser [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, itbecomes zero on one side of the secant and inanother case, it becomes zero on the other sideof the secant. See the positions P Q and PQ\nof the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are thetangents to the circle parallel to the given secantPQ. This also helps you to see that there cannotbe more than two tangents parallel to a givensecant.\nThis activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing\nActivity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the\ncorresponding chord coincide.\nThe common point of the tangent and the circle is called the point of contact\n[the point A in Fig. 10.1 (iii)]and the tangent is said to touch  the circle at the\ncommon point.\nNow look around you. Have you seen a bicycle\nor a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes\nof a wheel are along its radii. Now note the positionof the wheel with respect to its movement on theground. Do you see any tangent anywhere?(See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a linewhich is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel.Also, notice that in all positions, the radius throughthe point of contact with the ground appears to be atright angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4). We shallnow prove this property of the tangent.\nTheorem 10.1 :  The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the\nradius through the point of contact.\nP\nroof :  We are given a circle with centre O and a tangent XY to the circle at a\npoint P .\n We need to prove that OP is perpendicular to XY .Fig. 10.4Fig. 10.3 (ii)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 147\nTake a point Q on XY  other than P  and join OQ (see Fig. 10.5).\nThe point Q must lie outside the circle.\n(Why? Note that if Q lies inside the circle, XY\nwill become a secant and not a tangent to the\ncircle). Therefore, OQ is longer than the radius\nOP of the circle. That is,\nOQ > OP .\nSince this happens for every point on the\nline XY  except the point P , OP  is the\nshortest of all the distances of the point O to the\npoints of XY . So OP  is perpendicular to XY .\n(as shown in Theorem A1.7.)\nRemarks\n1. By theorem above, we can also conclude that at any point on a circle there can be\none and only one tangent.\n2. The line containing the radius through the point of contact is also sometimes called\nthe ‘normal’ to the circle at the point.\nEXERCISE 10.1\n1.How many tangents can a circle have?\n2.Fill in the blanks :\n(i)A tangent to a circle intersects it in  point (s).\n(ii)A line intersecting a circle in two points is called a  .\n(iii) A circle can have  parallel tangents at the most.\n(iv) The common point of a tangent to a circle and the circle is called  .\n3.A tangent PQ at a point P of a circle of radius 5 cm meets a line through the centre O at\na point Q so that OQ = 12 cm. Length PQ is :\n(A)12 cm (B)13 cm (C)8.5 cm (D) 119 cm.\n4.Draw a circle and two lines parallel to a given line such that one is a tangent and the\nother , a secant to the circle.\n10.3 Number  of Tangents fr om a Point on a Cir cle\nTo get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the\nfollowing activity:Fig. 10.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\n148 MATHEMA TICS\nActivity 3 :  Draw a circle on a paper. T ake a\npoint P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the\ncircle through this point? You will find that all\nthe lines through this point intersect the circle intwo points. So, it is not possible to draw any\ntangent to a circle through a point inside it\n[see Fig. 10.6 (i)].\nNext take a point P on the circle and draw\ntangents through this point. You have alreadyobserved that there is only one tangent to thecircle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)].\nFinally, take a point P outside the circle and\ntry to draw tangents to the circle from this point.What do you observe? You will find that you\ncan draw exactly two tangents to the circle\nthrough this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)].\nWe can summarise these facts as follows:\nCase 1 :  There is no tangent to a circle passing\nthrough a point lying inside the circle.\nCase 2 :  There is one and only one tangent to a\ncircle passing through a point lying on the circle.Case 3 :  There are exactly two tangents to a\ncircle through a point lying outside the circle.\nIn Fig. 10.6 (iii), T\n1and T2 are the points of\ncontact of the tangents PT1 and PT2\nrespectively.\nThe length of the segment of the tangent\nfrom the external point P and the point of contact\nwith the circle is called the length of the tangent\nfrom the point P to the circle.\nNote that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), PT1 and PT2 are the lengths of the tangents from P to\nthe circle. The lengths PT1 and PT2 have a common property. Can you find this?\nMeasure PT1 and PT2. Are these equal? In fact, this is always so. Let us give a proof\nof this fact in the following theorem.(i)\n(ii)\nFig. 10.6(iii)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 149\nTheorem 10.2 :  The lengths of tangents drawn\nfrom an external point to a cir cle ar e equal .\nProof :  We are given a circle with centre O, a\npoint P lying outside the circle and two tangents\nPQ, PR on the circle from P  (see Fig. 10.7). We\nare required to prove that PQ = PR.\nFor this, we join OP , OQ and OR. Then\n∠ OQP and ∠ ORP are right angles, because\nthese are angles between the radii and tangents,\nand according to Theorem 10.1 they are right\nangles. Now in right triangles OQP  and ORP ,\nOQ = OR (Radii of the same circle)\nOP = OP (Common)\nTherefore, ∆ OQP ≅∆ ORP (RHS)\nThis gives PQ = PR (CPCT)\nRemarks\n1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows:\nPQ2 = OP2 – OQ2 = OP2 – OR2 = PR2 (As OQ = OR)\nwhich gives PQ = PR.\n2. Note also that ∠ OPQ = ∠ OPR . Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of ∠ QPR,\ni.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents.\nLet us take some examples.\nExample 1 :  Prove that in two concentric circles,\nthe chord of the larger circle, which touches the\nsmaller circle, is bisected at the point of contact.\nSolution :  We are given two concentric circles\nC1 and C2 with centre O and a chord AB of the\nlarger circle C1 which touches the smaller circle\nC2 at the point P  (see Fig. 10.8). We need to prove\nthat AP = BP .\nLet us join OP . Then, AB is a tangent to C2 at P\nand OP is its radius. Therefore, by Theorem 10.1,\nOP ⊥ABFig. 10.7\nFig. 10.8\nReprint 2025-26\n\n150 MATHEMA TICS\nNow AB is a chord of the circle C1 and OP  AB. Therefore, OP is the bisector of the\nchord AB, as the perpendicular from the centre bisects the chord,\ni.e., AP = BP\nExample 2 :  Two tangents TP and TQ are drawn\nto a circle with centre O from an external point T.\nProve that  PTQ = 2  OPQ.\nSolution :  We are given a circle with centre O,\nan external point T and two tangents TP and TQ\nto the circle, where P , Q are the points of contact\n(see Fig. 10.9). W\ne need to prove that\n PTQ = 2  OPQ\nLet  PTQ =\nNow, by Theorem 10.2, TP = TQ. So, TPQ is an isosceles triangle.\nTherefore,  TPQ =  TQP =11(180° ) 90°22   \nAlso, by Theorem 10.1,  OPT = 90 °\nSo,  OPQ =  OPT –  TPQ =190° 90° –2\n=11PTQ22 \nThis gives  PTQ = 2  OPQ\nExample 3 :  PQ is a chord of length 8 cm of a\ncircle of radius 5 cm. The tangents at P and Q\nintersect at a point T (see Fig. 10.10). Find thelength TP .\nSolution :  Join OT. Let it intersect PQ at the\npoint R. Then  TPQ is isosceles and TO is the\nangle bisector of  PTQ. So, OT  PQ\nand therefore, OT bisects PQ which givesPR = RQ = 4 cm.\nAlso, OR = \n22 2 2OP PR 5 4 cm 3 c m    .Fig. 10.9\nFig. 10.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 151\nNow, TPR +  RPO = 90° =  TPR +  PTR (Why?)\nSo, RPO =  PTR\nTherefore, right triangle TRP is similar to the right triangle PRO by AA similarity.\nThis givesTP\nPO = RP\nRO, i.e.,TP\n5 = 4\n3 or TP =20\n3 cm.\nNote : TP can also be found by using the Pythagoras Theorem, as follows:\nLet TP = xand TR = y.

Recall\nthat the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed\nby two radii and the corresponding arc is called a\nsector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the\ncircular region enclosed between a chord and the\ncorresponding arc is called a segment of the circle.\nThus, in Fig. 1 1.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector\nof the circle with centre O. ∠ AOB is called the\nangle  of the sector . Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of\nthe circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and\nOAQB is called the major sector . You can also see that angle of the major sector is\n360° – ∠ AOB.\nNow , look at Fig. 1 1.2 in which AB is a chord\nof the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is\na segment of the circle. You can also note that\nunshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle\nformed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB\nis called the minor segment and AQB is called the\nmajor segment .\nRemark :  When we write ‘segment’  and ‘sector ’\nwe will mean the ‘minor segment’ and the ‘minor\nsector ’ respectively , unless stated otherwise.AREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES\nFig. 1 1.2Fig. 1 1.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\nAREAS R ELATED T O CIRCLES 155\nNow with this knowledge, let us try to find some\nrelations (or formulae) to calculate their areas.\nLet OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre\nO and radius r (see Fig. 1 1.3). Let the degree\nmeasure of Ð AOB be q.\nYou know that area of a circle (in fact of a\ncircular region or disc) is pr2.\nIn a way , we can consider this circular region to\nbe a sector forming an angle of 360° (i.e., of degree\nmeasure 360) at the centre O. Now by applying the\nUnitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the\nsector OAPB as follows:\nWhen degree measure of the angle at the centre is 360, area of the\nsector = pr2\nSo, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the\nsector = 2\n360r\nTherefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is q, area of the\nsector = 2\n360r  = 2\n360r .\nThus, we obtain the following relation (or formula) for area of a sector of a\ncircle:\nArea of the sector of angle q qqqq =r2\n360,\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and q the angle of the sector in degrees.\nNow , a natural question arises : Can we find\nthe length of the arc APB corresponding to this\nsector? Yes. Again, by applying the Unitary\nMethod and taking the whole length of the circle\n(of angle 360°) as 2 pr, we can obtain the required\nlength of the arc APB as 2360r  .\nSo,length of an arc of a sector of angle q qqqq = 2360r.Fig. 1 1.3\nFig. 1 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n156 MATHEMA TICS\nNow let us take the case of the area of the\nsegment APB of a circle with centre O and radius r\n(see Fig. 11.4).

We cannot classifythese under any of the solids you have already studied.\nIn this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such\nobjects.\n12.2 Surface Area of a Combination of Solids\nLet us consider the container seen in Fig. 12.2. How do we find the surface area ofsuch a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, ifwe can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see thatthis solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It wouldlook like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together.\nFig. 12.4\nIf we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see\nonly the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder .\nSo, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface\nareas of each of the individual parts. This gives,\nTSA of new solid = CSA of one hemisphere + CSA of cylinder\n                             + CSA of other hemisphere\nwhere \nTSA, CSA stand for ‘Total Surface Area’ and ‘Curved Surface Area’\nrespectively.\nLet us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting\ntogether a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going\nthrough.Fig. 12.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSURFACE  AREAS AND VOLUMES 163\nFirst, we would take a cone and a hemisphere and bring their flat faces together.\nHere, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the\nhemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shownin Fig. 12.5.\nFig. 12.5\nAt the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if\nwe want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy,\nwhat would we need to know? W\ne would need to know the surface area of the toy,\nwhich consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone.\nSo, we can say:\nTotal surface area of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone\nNow, let us consider some examples.\nExample 1 :  Rasheed got a playing top ( lattu) as his\nbirthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on\nit. He wanted to colour it with his crayons. The top isshaped like a cone surmounted by a hemisphere(see Fig 12.6). The entire top is 5 cm in height andthe diameter of the top is 3.5 cm. Find the area he\nhas to colour. (Take  = \n22\n7)\nSolution :  This top is exactly like the object we have discussed in Fig. 12.5. So, we\ncan conveniently use the result we have arrived at there. That is :\nTSA of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone\nNow,\n the curved surface area of the hemisphere =22 1(4 ) 22rr \n=2 22 3.5 3.52c m722Fig. 12.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n164 MATHEMA TICS\nAlso, the height of the cone = height of the top – height (radius) of the hemispherical part\n=3.55c m2 = 3.25 cm\nSo, the slant height of the cone ( l ) = 2\n22 2 3.5(3.25) cm\n2rh   = 3.7 cm (approx.)\nTherefore, CSA of cone = rl = 2 22 3.53.7 cm72\nThis gives the surface area of the top as\n=22 22 3.5 3.5 22 3.52c m 3 . 7 c m722 72        \n= 2 22 3.53.5 3.7 cm72  = 22 11(3.5 3.7) cm 39.6 cm (approx.)2 \nYou may note that ‘total surface area of the top’ is not the sum of the total\nsurface areas of the cone and hemisphere.\nExample 2 :  The decorative block shown\nin Fig. 12.7 is made of two solids — a cube\nand a hemisphere. The base of the block is a\ncube with edge 5 cm, and the hemisphere\nfixed on the top has a diameter of 4.2 cm.\nFind the total surface area of the block.\n(Take  = 22\n7)\nSolution :  The total surface area of the cube = 6 × (edge)2 = 6 × 5 × 5 cm2 = 150 cm2.\nNote that the part of the cube where the hemisphere is attached is not included in the\nsurface area.\nSo, the surface area of the block = TSA of cube – base area of hemisphere\n+ CSA of hemisphere\n= 150 – r2 + 2 r2 = (150 + r2) cm2\n=22 22 4.2 4.2150 cm cm722 \n= (150 + 13.86) cm2 = 163.86 cm2.\nFig. 12.7\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSURFACE  AREAS AND VOLUMES 165\nExample 3 :  A wooden toy rocket is in the\nshape of a cone mounted on a cylinder, as\nshown in Fig. 12.8. The height of the entire\nrocket is 26 cm, while the height of the conicalpart is 6 cm. The base of the conical portion\nhas a diameter of 5 cm, while the base\ndiameter of the cylindrical portion is 3 cm. Ifthe conical portion is to be painted orange\nand the cylindrical portion yellow\n, find the\narea of the rocket painted with each of these\ncolours. (Take  = 3.14)\nSolution :  Denote radius of cone by r, slant\nheight of cone by l, height of cone by h, radius\nof cylinder by r and height of cylinder by h .\nThen r = 2.5 cm, h = 6 cm, r = 1.5 cm,\nh = 26 – 6 = 20 cm and\nl =22rh  = 222.5 6 cm  = 6.5 cm\nHere, the conical portion has its circular base resting on the base of the cylinder, but\nthe base of the cone is larger than the base of the cylinder. So, a part of the base of thecone (a ring) is to be painted.\nSo, the area to be painted orange = CSA of the cone + base area of the cone\n                                                           – base area of the cylinder\n=rl + r\n2 – r2\n=[(2.5 × 6.5) + (2.5)2  – (1.5)2] cm2\n=[20.25] cm2 = 3.14 × 20.25 cm2\n= 63.585 cm2\nNow, the area to be painted yellow = CSA of the cylinder\n+ area of one base of the cylinder\n=2rh + (r)2\n=r (2h + r)\n= (3.14 × 1.5) (2 × 20 + 1.5) cm2\n= 4.71 × 41.5 cm2\n= 195.465 cm2Fig. 12.8\nReprint 2025-26\n\n166 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 4 :  Mayank made a bird-bath for his garden\nin the shape of a cylinder with a hemispherical\ndepression at one end (see Fig. 12.9).

Here, we shall see how to calculate theirvolumes. It may be noted that in calculating the surface area, we have not added thesurface areas of the two constituents, because some part of the surface area disappearedin the process of joining them. However, this will not be the case when we calculatethe volume. The volume of the solid formed by joining two basic solids will actually bethe sum of the volumes of the constituents, as we see in the examples below.\nExample 5 :  Shanta runs an industry in\na shed which is in the shape of a cuboid\nsurmounted by a half cylinder (see Fig.12.12). If the base of the shed is ofdimension 7 m × 15 m, and the height ofthe cuboidal portion is 8 m, find the volumeof air that the shed can hold. Further,\nsuppose the machinery in the shedoccupies a total space of 300 m\n3, and\nthere are 20 workers, each of whomoccupy about 0.08 m\n3 space on an\naverage. Then, how much air is in the\nshed? (Take  = 22\n7)Fig. 12.12Fig. 12.11\nReprint 2025-26\n\n168 MATHEMA TICS\nSolution :  The volume of air inside the shed (when there are no people or machinery)\nis given by the volume of air inside the cuboid and inside the half cylinder, taken\ntogether.\nNow\n, the length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15 m, 7 m and 8 m, respectively.\nAlso, the diameter of the half cylinder is 7 m and its height is 15 m.\nSo, the required volume = volume of the cuboid + 1\n2 volume of the cylinder\n=3 12 27715 7 8 15 m272 2  = 1128.75 m3\nNext, the total space occupied by the machinery = 300 m3\nAnd the total space occupied by the workers = 20 × 0.08 m3 = 1.6 m3\nTherefore, the volume of the air, when there are machinery and workers\n= 1128.75 – (300.00 + 1.60) = 827.15 m3\nExample 6 :  A juice seller was serving his\ncustomers using glasses as shown in Fig. 12.13.\nThe inner diameter of the cylindrical glass was5 cm, but the bottom of the glass had ahemispherical raised portion which reduced thecapacity of the glass. If the height of a glasswas 10 cm, find the apparent capacity of theglass and its actual capacity. (Use  = 3.14.)\nSolution :  Since the inner diameter of the glass = 5 cm and height = 10 cm,\nthe apparent capacity of the glass = r\n2h\n= 3.14 × 2.5 × 2.5 × 10 cm3 = 196.25 cm3\nBut the actual capacity of the glass is less by the volume of the hemisphere at the\nbase of the glass.\ni.e., it is less by 2\n3 r3 =3 23.14 2.5 2.5 2.5 cm3    = 32.71 cm3\nSo, the actual capacity of the glass = apparent capacity of glass – volume of the\nhemisphere\n= (196.25 – 32.71) cm3\n= 163.54 cm3Fig. 12.13\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSURFACE  AREAS AND VOLUMES 169\nExample 7 :  A solid toy is in the form of a\nhemisphere surmounted by a right circular cone.

If a\nright circular cylinder circumscribes the toy, find the\ndif\nference of the volumes of the cylinder and the toy.\n(Take  = 3.14)\nSolution :  Let BPC be the hemisphere and ABC be the cone standing on the base\nof the hemisphere (see Fig. 12.14). The radius BO of the hemisphere (as well as\nof the cone) = 1\n2 × 4 cm = 2 cm.\nSo, volume of the toy =3221\n33rr h\n=32 3 213.14 (2) 3.14 (2) 2 cm33  = 25.12 cm3\nNow, let the right circular cylinder EFGH circumscribe the given solid. The radius of\nthe base of the right circular cylinder = HP = BO = 2 cm, and its height is\nEH = AO + OP = (2 + 2) cm = 4 cm\nSo, the volume required = volume of the right circular cylinder – volume of the toy\n    =  (3.14 × 22 × 4 – 25.12) cm3\n    =  25.12 cm3\nHence, the required difference of the two volumes = 25.12 cm3.\nEXERCISE 12.2\nUnless stated otherwise, take  = 22\n7.\n  A solid is in the shape of a cone standing on a hemisphere with both their radii being\nequal to 1 cm and the height of the cone is equal to its radius.

You have also learnt to represent the data pictoriallyin the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varyingwidths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certainnumerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of centraltendency, namely, mean , median  and mode . In this chapter, we shall extend the study\nof these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that ofgrouped data . We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the\ncumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, calledogives .\n13.2 Mean of Grouped Data\nThe mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all theobservations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that ifx\n1, x2,. . ., xn are observations with respective frequencies f1, f2, . . ., fn, then this\nmeans observation x1 occurs f1 times, x2 occurs f2 times, and so on.\nNow, the sum of the values of all the observations = f1x1 + f2x2 + . . . + fnxn,  and\nthe number of observations = f1 + f2 + . . . + fn.\nSo, the mean x of the data is given by\nx =11 2 2\n12nn\nnfx fx fx\nff f \n\n\nRecall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter  (capital\nsigma) which means summation.

Find the\nmean of the marks obtained by the students.\nMarks obtained 10 20\n36 40 50 56 60 70 72 80 88 92 95\n(xi)\n    Number of 113432441123 1\nstudents ( fi)\nSolution: Recall that to find the mean marks, we require the product of each xi with\nthe corresponding frequency fi. So, let us put them in a column as shown in Table 13.1.\nTable 13.1\nMarks obtained  (xi) Number of students  (fi) fixi\n10 1 10\n20 1 20\n. 36 3 108\n40 4 160\n50 3 150\n56 2 112\n60 4 240\n70 4 280\n72 1 72\n80 1 80\n88 2 176\n92 3 276\n95 1 95\nTotal fi = 30 fixi = 1779\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 173\nNow,  \ni i\nif xx\nf = 1779\n30 = 59.3\nTherefore, the mean marks obtained is 59.3.\nIn most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful\nstudy it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped\ndata into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.\nLet us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming\nclass-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each\nclass-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next\nclass, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the class-\ninterval 4 0-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped\nfrequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).\nTable 13.2\nClass interval 10 - 25 25 \n- 40 40 -  55 55 -  70 70 - 85 85 - 100\nNumber of students 2 3 7 6\n6 6\nNow , for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the\nrepresentative of the whole class. It is assumed that the fr equency of each class-\ninter val is centr ed ar ound its mid-point . So the mid-point  (or class mark ) of each\nclass can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we\nfind the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and\nlower limits. That is,\nClass mark =Upper class limit + Lower class limit\n2\nWith reference to Table 13.2, for the class 1 0-25, the class mark is 10 25\n2+, i.e.,\n17.5. Similarly , we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put\nthem in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our xi’s. Now , in general, for the ith\nclass interval, we have the frequency fi corresponding to the class mark xi. We can\nnow proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n174 MATHEMA TICS\nTable 13.3\nClass interval Number of students  (fi) Class mark  (xi) fixi\n10 - 25 2 17.5 35.0\n25 - 40 3 32.5 97.5\n40 - 55 7 47.5 332.5\n55 \n- 70 6 62.5 375.0\n70 - 85 6 77.5 465.0\n85 - 100 6 92.5 555.0\nTotal Σ fi = 30 Σ fixi = 1860.0\nThe sum of the values in the last column gives us Σ fixi. So, the mean x of the\ngiven data is given by\nx =1860.06230i i\nif x\nfΣ= =Σ\nThis new method of finding the mean is known as the Direct Method .\nWe observe that Tables 13.1 and 13.3 are using the same data and employing the\nsame formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different.\nCan you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the\ntwo values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact\nmean, while 62 an approximate mean.\nSometimes when the numerical values of xi and fi are large, finding the product\nof xi and fi becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of\na method of reducing these calculations.\nWe can do nothing with the fi’s, but we can change each xi to a smaller number\nso that our calculations become easy . How do we do this? What about subtracting a\nfixed number from each of these xi’s? Let us try this method.\nThe first step is to choose one among the xi’s as the assumed mean , and denote\nit by ‘ a’. Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take ‘ a’ to be that xi\nwhich lies in the centre of x1, x2, . . ., xn. So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let\nus choose a = 47.5.\nThe next step is to find the dif ference di between a and each of the xi’s, that is,\nthe deviation  of ‘a’ from each of the xi’s.\ni.e., di =xi – a = xi – 47.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 175\nThe third step is to find the product of di with the correspondin g fi, and take the sum\nof all the fi di’s. The calculations are shown in Table 13.4.\nTable 13.4\nClass interval Number of Class mark di = xi – 47.5 fidi\n students  (fi)  (xi)\n10 - 25 2 17.5 –30 –60\n25 - 40 3 32.5 –15 –45\n40 - 55 7 47.5 0 0\n55 - 70 6 62.5 15 90\n70 - 85 6 77.5 30 180\n85 - 100 6 92.5 45 270\nTotal Σfi = 30 Σfidi = 435\nSo, from Table 13.4, the mean of the deviations, d = i i\nif d\nfΣ\nΣ.\nNow , let us find the relation between d and x.\nSince in obtaining di, we subtracted ‘a’ from each xi, so, in order to get the mean\nx, we need to add ‘ a’ to d. This can be explained mathematically as:\nMean of deviations, d =i i\nif d\nfΣ\nΣ\n So, d =( )i i\nif x a\nfΣ −\nΣ\n =i i i\ni if x f a\nf fΣ Σ−\nΣ Σ\n =i\nifx a\nfΣ−\nΣ\n =x a−\nSo, x =a + d\ni.e., x =i i\nif da\nfΣ+\nΣ\nReprint 2025-26\n\n176 MATHEMA TICS\nSubstituting the values of a, Σfidi and Σfi from Table 13.4, we get\nx =43547.5 47.5 14.5 6230+ = + = .\nTherefore, the mean of the marks obtained by the students is 62.\nThe method discussed above is called the Assumed Mean Method .\nActivity 1 :  From the Table 13.3 find the mean by taking each of xi (i.e., 17.5, 32.5,\nand so on) as ‘ a’. What do you observe? You will find that the mean determined in\neach case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?)\nSo, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the\nchoice of ‘ a’.\nObserve that in Table 13.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if\nwe divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to\nmultiply with fi.

Further, we\ndiscussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaininga mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same\nmaximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal.  Though\ngrouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a\nsingle mode only.\nLet us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following\nexample.\nExample 4 :  The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows:\n2645 02\n1323\nFind the mode of the data.\nSolution :  Let us form the frequency distribution table of the given data as follows:\nNumber of 0123456\nwickets\nNumber of 1132111\nmatches\nReprint 2025-26\n\n184 MATHEMA TICS\nClearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number\n(i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2.\nIn a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by\nlooking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum\nfrequency, called the modal class . The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is\ngiven by the formula:\nMode =10\n10 22fflhff f\nwhere l = lower limit of the modal class,\nh = size of the class interval (assuming all class sizes to be equal),\nf1 = frequency of the modal class,\nf0 = frequency of the class preceding the modal class,\nf2 = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class.\nLet us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula.\nExample 5 :  A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students\nresulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in ahousehold:\nFamily size 1 - 3 3 - 5 5 - 7\n7 - 9 9 - 11\nNumber of 78221\nfamilies\nFind the mode of this data.\nSolution :  Here the maximum class frequency is 8, and the class corresponding to this\nfrequency is 3 – 5. So, the modal class is 3 – 5.\nNow\nmodal class = 3 – 5, lower limit (l) of modal class = 3,\nclass size ( h) = 2\nfrequency ( f1) of the modal class = 8,\nfrequency ( f0) of class preceding the modal class = 7,\nfrequency ( f2) of class succeeding the modal class = 2.\nNow, let us substitute these values in the formula :\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 185\nMode =10\n10 22fflhff f\n=87 23 2 3 3.286287 2 7  \nTherefore, the mode of the data above is 3.286.\nExample 6 :  The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are\ngiven in T able 13.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. \nAlso compare and\ninterpret the mode and the mean.\nSolution :  Refer to Table 13.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students\n(i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore,\nthe lower limit ( l) of the modal class = 40,\nthe class size ( h) = 15,\nthe frequency ( f1) of modal class = 7,\nthe frequency ( f0) of the class preceding the modal class = 3,\nthe frequency ( f2) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6.\nNow, using the formula:\nMode =10\n1022fflhff f,\nwe get Mode =7340 1514 6 3 = 52\nSo, the mode marks is 52.Now, from Example 1, you know that the mean marks is 62.\nSo, the maximum number of students obtained 52 marks, while on an average a\nstudent obtained 62 marks.\nRemarks :\n1. In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may\nbe equal or more than the mean also.\n2. It depends upon the demand of the situation whether we are interested in finding the\naverage marks obtained by the students or the average of the marks obtained by most\nReprint 2025-26\n\n186 MATHEMA TICS\nof the students. In the first situation, the mean is required and in the second situation,\nthe mode is required.\nActivity 3 :  Continuing with the same groups as formed in Activity 2 and the situations\nassigned to the groups. Ask each group to find the mode of the data. \nThey should also\ncompare this with the mean, and interpret the meaning of both.\nRemark : The mode can also be calculated for grouped data with unequal class sizes.\nHowever, we shall not be discussing it.\nEXERCISE 13.2\n1.The following table shows the ages of the patients admitted in a hospital during a year:\nAge (in years) 5 - 15 15 - 25 25 - 35 35 - 45 45 - 55 55 - 65\nNumber of patients 61 1 2 1 2 3 1 45\nFind the mode and the mean of the data given above.

Recall that for finding themedian of ungrouped data, we first arrange the data values of the observations in\nascending order. Then, if n is odd, the median is the 1\n2n\nth observation. And, if n\nis even, then the median will be the average of the th2nand the 1t h2n observations.\nSuppose, we have to find the median of the following data, which gives the\nmarks, out of 50, obtained by 100 students in a test :\nMarks obtained 20 29 28 33 42 38 43 25\nNumber of students 6 2 8 2 4 1 5 241 2 0\nFirst, we arrange the marks in ascending order and prepare a frequency table as\nfollows :\nTable 13.9\nMarks obtained Number of students\n(Frequency)\n20 6\n25 20\n28 24\n29 28\n33 15\n38 4\n42 2\n43 1\nTotal 100\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 189\nHere n = 100, which is even. The median will be the average of the \n2nth and the\n12nth observations, i.e., the 50th and 51st observations. To find these\nobservations, we proceed as follows:\nTable 13.10\nMarks obtained Number of students\n20 6\nupto 25 6 + 20 = 26\nupto 28 26 + 24 = 50\nupto 29 50 + 28 = 78\nupto 33 78 + 15 = 93\nupto 38 93 + 4 = 97\nupto 42 97 + 2 = 99\nupto 43 99 + 1 = 100\nNow we add another column depicting this information to the frequency table\nabove and name it as cumulative frequency column .\nTable 13.11\nMarks obtained Number of students Cumulative frequency\n20 6 6\n25 20 26\n28 24 50\n29 28 78\n33 15 93\n38 4 97\n42 2 99\n43 1 100\nReprint 2025-26\n\n190 MATHEMA TICS\nFrom the table above, we see that:\n50th observaton is 28 (Why?)\n51st observation is 29\nSo, Median =28 2928.52+=\nRemark :  The part of Table 13.1 1 consisting Column 1 and Column 3 is known as\nCumulative Fr equency T able. The median marks 28.5 conveys the information that\nabout 50% students obtained marks less than 28.5 and another 50% students obtained\nmarks more than 28.5.\nNow , let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following\nsituation.\nConsider a grouped frequency distribution of marks obtained, out of 100, by 53\nstudents, in a certain examination, as follows:\nTable 13.12\nMarks Number of students\n0 - 10 5\n10 - 20 3\n20 - 30 4\n30 - 40 3\n40 - 50 3\n50 - 60 4\n60 - 70 7\n70 - 80 9\n80 - 90 7\n90 - 100 8\nFrom the table above, try to answer the following questions:\nHow many students have scored marks less than 10? The answer is clearly 5.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 191\nHow many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number\nof students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have\nscored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks\nfrom 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is 5 + 3, i.e., 8.\nWe say that the cumulative frequency of the class 1 0-20 is 8.\nSimilarly , we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e.,\nthe number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100. We\ngive them in Table 13.13 given below:\nTable 13.13\nMarks obtained Number of students\n(Cumulative frequency)\nLess than 10 5\nLess than 20 5 + 3 = 8\nLess than 30 8 + 4 = 12\nLess than 40 12 + 3 = 15\nLess than 50 15 + 3 = 18\nLess than 60 18 + 4 = 22\nLess than 70 22 + 7 = 29\nLess than 80 29 + 9 = 38\nLess than 90 38 + 7 = 45\nLess than 100 45 + 8 = 53\nThe distribution given above is called the cumulative fr equency distribution of\nthe less than type . Here 10, 20, 30, . . . 100, are the upper limits of the respective\nclass intervals.\nWe can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more\nthan or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From\nTable 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to\n0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there\nare 53 – 5 = 48 students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the\nsame manner , we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as 48 – 3 = 45, 30 or\nabove as 45 – 4 = 41, and so on, as shown in Table 13.14.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n192 MATHEMA TICS\nTable 13.14\nMarks obtained Number of students\n(Cumulative frequency)\nMore than or equal to 0 53\nMore than or equal to 10 53 – 5 = 48More than or equal to 20 48 – 3 = 45More than or equal to 30 45 – 4 = 41More than or equal to 40 41 – 3 = 38\nMore than or equal to 50 38 – 3 = 35\nMore than or equal to 60 35 – 4 = 31More than or equal to 70 31 – 7 = 24More than or equal to 80 24 – 9 = 15More than or equal to 90 15 – 7 =  8\nThe table above is called a cumulative frequency distribution of the more\nthan type . Here 0, 10, 20, . . ., 90 give the lower limits of the respective class intervals.\nNow, to find the median of grouped data, we can make use of any of these\ncumulative frequency distributions.\nLet us combine Tables 13.12 and 13.13 to get Table 13.15 given below:\nTable 13.15\nMarks Number of students  (f) Cumulative frequency  (cf)\n0 - 10 5 5\n10 - 20 3 8\n20 - 30 4 12\n30 - 40 3 15\n40 - 50 3 18\n50 - 60 4 22\n60 - 70 7 29\n70 - 80 9 3880 - 90 7 45\n90 - 100 8 53\nNow in a grouped data, we may not be able to find the middle observation by\nlooking at the cumulative frequencies as the middle observation will be some value in\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 193\na class interval. It is, therefore, necessary to find the value inside a class that divides\nthe whole distribution into two halves. But which class should this be?\nTo find this class, we find the cumulative frequencies of all the classes and 2n.\nWe now locate the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than (and nearest to)\n2n This is called the median class . In the distribution above, n = 53. So, 2n = 26.5.\nNow 60 – 70 is the class whose cumulative frequency 29 is greater than (and nearest\nto) 2n, i.e., 26.5.\nTherefore, 60 – 70 is the median class .\nAfter finding the median class, we use the following formula for calculating the\nmedian.\nMedian =cf2+,n\nlhf\n \n\nwhere l = lower limit of median class,\nn = number of observations,\ncf = cumulative frequency of class preceding the median class,\nf = frequency of median class,\nh = class size (assuming class size to be equal).\nSubstituting the values 26.5,2n  l = 60, cf = 22, f = 7, h = 10\nin the formula above, we get\nMedian =26.5 2260 107\n= 60 + 45\n7\n= 66.4\nSo, about half the students have scored marks less than 66.4, and the other half have\nscored marks more than 66.4.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n194 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 7 :  A survey regarding the heights (in cm) of 51 girls of Class X of a school\nwas conducted and the following data was obtained:\nHeight (in cm) Number of \ngirls\nLess than 140 4\nLess than 145 11\nLess than 150 29\nLess than 155 40\nLess than 160 46\nLess than 165 51\nFind the median height.\nSolution :  To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their\ncorresponding frequencies.\nThe given distribution being of the less than type , 140, 145, 150, . . ., 165 give the\nupper limits of the corresponding class intervals. So, the classes should be below 140,\n140 - 145, 145 - 150, . . ., 160 - 165. Observe that from the given distribution, we findthat there are 4 girls with height less than 140, i.e., the frequency of class intervalbelow 140 is 4. Now , there are 1\n1 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with\nheight less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval140 - 145 is 11 – 4 = 7. Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is 29 – 11 = 18, for150 - 155, it is 40 – 29 = 11, and so on. So, our frequency distribution  table with thegiven cumulative frequencies becomes:\nTable 13.16\nClass intervals Frequency Cumulative frequency\nBelow 140 4 4\n140 - 145 7 11\n145 - 150 18 29\n150 - 155 11 40\n155 - 160 6 46\n160 - 165 5 51\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 195\nNow n = 51.

It also enables us to compare two or\nmore distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students\nof different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has abetter performance.\nHowever, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of\nclasses having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data.\nBut, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20,\n21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in suchcases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.\nIn problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find\nout a ‘typical’ observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical\nproductivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations\nwhere extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median asa better measure of central tendency.\nIn situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular\nitem, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T.V . programme being\nwatched, the consumer item in greatest demand, the colour of the vehicle used by\nmost of the people, etc.\nRemarks :\n1. There is a empirical relationship between the three measures of central tendency :\n3 Median = Mode + 2 Mean\n2. The median of grouped data with unequal class sizes can also be calculated.

Woodward\n14.1 Probability — A Theor etical Appr oach\nLet us consider the following situation :\nSuppose a coin is tossed at random .\nWhen we speak of a coin, we assume it to be ‘fair ’, that is, it is symmetrical so\nthat there is no reason for it to come down more often on one side than the other .\nWe call this property of the coin as being ‘unbiased’. By the phrase ‘random tos s’,\nwe mean that the coin is allowed to fall freely without any bias or interfer ence.\nWe know , in advance, that the coin can only land in one of two possible ways —\neither head up or tail up (we dismiss the possibility of its ‘landing’ on its edge, which\nmay be possible, for example, if it falls on sand). We can reasonably assume that each\noutcome, head or tail, is as likely to occur as the other . We refer to this by saying that\nthe outcomes  head and tail, are equally likely .\nFor another example of equally likely outcomes, suppose we throw a die\nonce. For us, a die will always mean a fair die. What are the possible outcomes?\nThey are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each number has the same possibility of showing up. So\nthe equally likely outcomes  of throwing a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.PROBABILITY\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROBABILITY 203\nAre the outcomes of every experiment equally likely? Let us see.\nSuppose that a bag contains 4 red balls and 1 blue ball, and you draw a ball\nwithout looking into the bag. What are the outcomes? Are the outcomes — a red ball\nand a blue ball equally likely? Since there are 4 red balls and only one blue ball, youwould agree that you are more likely to get a red ball than a blue ball. So, the outcomes(a red ball or a blue ball) are not equally likely. However, the outcome of drawing a\nball of any colour from the bag is equally likely. So, all experiments do not necessarilyhave equally likely outcomes.\nHowever, in this chapter, from now on, we will assume that all the experiments\nhave equally likely outcomes.\nIn Class IX, we defined the experimental or empirical probability P(E) of an\nevent E as\nP(E) = \nNumber of trials in which the event happened\nTotal number of trials\nThe empirical interpretation of probability can be applied to every event associated\nwith an experiment which can be repeated a large number of times. The requirement\nof repeating an experiment has some limitations, as it may be very expensive orunfeasible in many situations. Of course, it worked well in coin tossing or die throwingexperiments. But how about repeating the experiment of launching a satellite in orderto compute the empirical probability of its failure during launching, or the repetition ofthe phenomenon of an earthquake to compute the empirical probability of a multi-storeyed building getting destroyed in an earthquake?\nIn experiments where we are prepared to make certain assumptions, the repetition\nof an experiment can be avoided, as the assumptions help in directly calculating theexact (theoretical) probability. The assumption of equally likely outcomes (which isvalid in many experiments, as in the two examples above, of a coin and of a die) is onesuch assumption that leads us to the following definition of probability of an event.\nThe theoretical probability  (also called classical probability ) of an event E,\nwritten as P(E), is defined as\nP(E) = \nNumber of outcomes favourable to E\nNumber of all possible outcomes of the experiment,\nwhere we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely .\nWe will briefly refer to theoretical probability as probability.\nThis definition of probability was given by Pierre Simon Laplace in 1795.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n204 MATHEMA TICS\nProbability theory had its origin in the 16th century when\nan Italian physician and mathematician J.Cardan wrote thefirst book on the subject, The Book on Games of Chance.\nSince its inception, the study of probability has attractedthe attention of great mathematicians. James Bernoulli(1654 – 1705), A. de Moivre (1667 – 1754), andPierre Simon Laplace are among those who made significantcontributions to this field. Laplace’s Theorie  Analytique\ndes Probabilités, 1812, is considered to be the greatest\ncontribution by a single person to the theory of probability.In recent years, probability has been used extensively inmany areas such as biology, economics, genetics, physics,sociology etc.\nLet us find the probability for some of the events associated with experiments\nwhere the equally likely assumption holds.\nExample 1 :  Find the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed once. Also\nfind the probability of getting a tail.\nSolution :  In the experiment of tossing a coin once, the number of possible outcomes\nis two — Head (H) and T ail (T). Let E be the event ‘getting a head’. The number of\noutcomes favourable to E, (i.e., of getting a head) is 1. Therefore,\nP(E) = P (head) =\nNumber of outcomes favourable to E\nNumber of all possible outcomes = 1\n2\nSimilarly, if F is the event ‘getting a tail’, then\nP(F) = P(tail) = 1\n2(Why ?)\nExample 2 :  A bag contains a red ball, a blue ball and a yellow ball, all the balls being\nof the same size. Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. What is\nthe probability that she takes out the\n(i)\nyellow ball? (ii)red ball? (iii)blue ball?\nSolution : Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. So, it is equally\nlikely that she takes out any one of them.Pierre  Simon Laplace\n(1749 – 1827)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROBABILITY 205\nLet Y be the event ‘the ball taken out is yellow’, B be the event ‘the ball taken\nout is blue’, and R be the event ‘the ball taken out is red’.\nNow, the number of possible outcomes = 3.\n(i) The number of outcomes favourable to the event Y = 1.\nSo, P(Y) =1\n3\nSimilarly, (ii) P(R) =1\n3and (iii) P(B) = 1\n3\nRemarks :\n1. An event having only one outcome of the experiment is called an elementary\nevent.  In Example 1, both the events E and F are elementary events. Similarly, in\nExample 2, all the three events, Y\n, B and R are elementary events.\n2. In Example 1, we note that : P(E) + P(F) = 1In Example 2, we note that : P(Y) + P(R) + P(B) = 1\nObserve that the sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of\nan experiment is 1. This is true in general also.\nExample 3 :  Suppose we throw a die once. (i) What is the probability of getting a\nnumber greater than 4 ? (ii) What is the probability of getting a number less than or\nequal to 4 ?\nSolution :  (i) Here, let E be the event ‘getting a number greater than 4’. The number\nof possible outcomes is six : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and the outcomes favourable to E are 5\nand 6. Therefore, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 2. So,\nP(E) = P(number greater than 4) = 2\n6 = 1\n3\n(ii)Let F be the event ‘getting a number less than or equal to 4’.\nNumber of possible outcomes = 6\nOutcomes favourable to the event F are 1, 2, 3, 4.So, the number of outcomes favourable to F is 4.\nTherefore, P(F) =4\n6 = 2\n3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n206 MATHEMA TICS\nAre the events E and F in the example above elementary events? No, they are\nnot because the event E has 2 outcomes and the event F has 4 outcomes.\nRemarks :  From Example 1, we note that\nP(E) + P(F) = 11122 (1)\nwhere E is the event ‘getting a head’ and F is the event ‘getting a tail’.\nFrom (i) and (ii) of Example 3, we also get\nP(E) + P(F) = 12133 (2)\nwhere E is the event ‘getting a number >4’ and F is the event ‘getting a number  4’.\nNote that getting a number not greater than 4 is same as getting a number less\nthan or equal to 4, and vice versa.\nIn (1) and (2) above, is F not the same as ‘not E’? Yes, it is. We denote the event\n‘not E’ by E.\nSo, P(E) + P(not E) = 1\ni.e., P(E) + P( E) = 1, which gives us P( E) = 1 – P(E).\nIn general, it is true that for an event E,\nP(E) = 1 – P(E)\nThe event E, representing ‘not E’, is called the complement  of the event E.\nWe also say that E and E are complementary  events.\nBefore proceeding further, let us try to find the answers to the following questions:\n(i) What is the probability of getting a number 8 in a single throw of a die?\n(ii)What is the probability of getting a number less than 7 in a single throw of a die?\nLet us answer (i) :\nWe know that there are only six possible outcomes in a single throw of a die. These\noutcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Since no face of the die is marked 8, so there is no\noutcome favourable to 8, i.e., the number of such outcomes is zero. In other words,\ngetting 8 in a single throw of a die, is impossible .\nSo, P(getting 8) =0\n6 = 0\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROBABILITY 207\nThat is, the probability of an event which is impossible  to occur is 0. Such an\nevent is called an impossible event .\nLet us answer (ii) :\nSince every face of a die is marked with a number less than 7, it is sure that we\nwill always get a number less than 7 when it is thrown once. So, the number of\nfavourable outcomes is the same as the number of all possible outcomes, which is 6.\nTherefore, P(E) = P(getting a number less than 7) = 6\n6 = 1\nSo, the probability of an event which is sure (or certain ) to occur is 1. Such an event\nis called a sure event  or a certain event .\nNote : From the definition of the probability P(E), we see that the numerator (number\nof outcomes favourable to the event E) is always less than or equal to the denominator\n(the number of all possible outcomes). Therefore,\n0    P(E)    1\nNow, let us take an example related to playing cards. Have you seen a deck of\nplaying cards? It consists of 52 cards which are divided into 4 suits of 13 cards each—\nspades (), hearts ( ), diamonds ( ) and clubs ( ). Clubs and spades are of black\ncolour, while hearts and diamonds are of red colour. The cards in each suit are ace,king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2.

Here (H, H) means head up on the first coin (say on ` 1) and head up\non the second coin (`  2). Similarly (H, T) means head up on the first coin and tail up on\nthe second coin and so on.\nThe outcomes favourable to the event E, ‘at least one head’ are (H, H), (H, T)\nand (T, H). (Why?)\nSo, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 3.\nTherefore, P(E) =3\n4\ni.e., the probability that Harpreet gets at least one head is 3\n4\nNote : You can also find P(E) as follows:\nP (E) =131–P( E )=1–441S i n c eP ( E )=P ( n oh e a d )=4\n\nDid you observe that in all the examples discussed so far, the number of possible\noutcomes in each experiment was finite? If not, check it now.\nThere are many experiments in which the outcome is any number between two\ngiven numbers, or in which the outcome is every point within a circle or rectangle, etc.\nCan you now count the number of all possible outcomes? As you know, this is notpossible since there are infinitely many numbers between two given numbers, or thereare infinitely many  points within a circle. So, the definition of (theoretical) probabilitywhich you have learnt so far cannot be applied in the present form. What is the wayout? To answer this, let us consider the following example :\nExample 10* : In a musical chair game, the person playing the music has been\nadvised to stop playing the music at any time within 2 minutes after she starts\nplaying. What is the probability that the music will stop within the first half-minuteafter starting?\nSolution :  Here the possible outcomes are all the numbers between 0 and 2.

What is the probability that\n(i) it is acceptable to Jimmy?\n(ii) it is acceptable to Sujatha?\nSolution :  One shirt is drawn at random from the carton of 100 shirts. Therefore,\nthere are 100 equally likely outcomes.\n(i)\nThe number of outcomes favourable (i.e., acceptable) to Jimmy = 88 (Why?)\nTherefore, P (shirt is acceptable to Jimmy) = 880.88100\n(ii)The number of outcomes favourable to Sujatha = 88 + 8 = 96 (Why?)\nSo, P (shirt is acceptable to Sujatha) = 960.96100\nExample 13 :  Two dice, one blue and one grey, are thrown at the same time.

{"class": "10", "subject": "math", "chapter": "Chapter 1: real numbers", "content": "REAL NUMBERS 1\n1\n1.1Introduction\nIn Class IX, you began your exploration of the world of real numbers and encountered\nirrational numbers. We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter . We\nbegin with very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2, namely the\nEuclid’ s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\nEuclid’ s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of\nintegers. S tated simply , it says any positive integer a  can be divided by another positive\ninteger b in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than b. Many of you\nprobably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite\neasy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties\nof integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of\ntwo positive integers.\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something\nwith multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number\ncan be expressed as a product of primes in a unique wa y—this important fact is the\nFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and\nunderstand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics.\nWe use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we\nuse it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as\n2 , 3  and 5. Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal\nexpansion of a rational number , say ( 0)pqq , is terminating and when it is non-\nterminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator\nq of p\nq. You will see that the prime factorisation of q will completely reveal the nature\nof the decimal expansion of p\nq.\nSo let us begin our exploration.REAL NUMBERS\nReprint 2025-26\n\n2 MATHEMA TICS\n1.2The Fundamental Theor em of Arithmetic\nIn your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a\nproduct of its prime factors. For instance, 2 = 2, 4 = 2 × 2, 253 = 1 1 × 23, and so on.\nNow , let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any\nnatural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.\nTake any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 1 1 and 23. If we multiply\nsome or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish,\nwe can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many).\nLet us list a few :\n7 × 1 1 × 23 = 1771 3 × 7 × 1 1 × 23 = 5313\n2 × 3 × 7 × 1 1 × 23 = 10626 23 × 3 × 73 = 8232\n22 × 3 × 7 × 1 1 × 23 = 21252\nand so on.\nNow , let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes.\nWhat is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite\nnumber of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So,\nif we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite\ncollection of numbers, all\nthe primes and all possible\nproducts of primes. The\nquestion is – can we\nproduce all the composite\nnumbers this way? What\ndo you think? Do you\nthink that there may be a\ncomposite number which\nis not the product of\npowers of primes?\nBefore we answer this,\nlet us factorise positive\nintegers, that is, do the\nopposite of what we have\ndone so far .\nWe are going to use\nthe factor tree with which\nyou are all familiar . Let us\ntake some lar ge number ,\nsay, 32760, and factorise\nit as shown.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nREAL NUMBERS 3\nCarl Friedrich Gauss\n(1777 – 1855)\nAn equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably\nfirst recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid’s\nElements, before it came to be known as the\nFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However , the\nfirst correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss\nin his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae .\nCarl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the ‘Prince\nof Mathematicians’ and is considered one of the three\ngreatest mathematicians of all time, along with\nArchimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental\ncontributions to both mathematics and science.So we have factorised 32760 as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of\nprimes, i.e., 32760 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of powers of primes. Let us try\nanother number , say, 123456789. This can be written as 32 × 3803 × 3607. Of course,\nyou have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (T ry it out for several other natural\nnumbers yourself.)   This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be\nwritten as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called\nthe Fundamental Theor em of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance\nto the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.\nTheor em 1.1  (Fundamental Theor em of Arithmetic) : Ever y composite\nnumber can be expr essed (factorise d) as a pr oduct of primes, and this factorisation\nis unique, apar t from the or der in which the prime factors occur .\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can\nbe factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any\ncomposite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’\nway, except for the order in which the primes occur . That is, given any composite\nnumber there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we\nare not particular about the order in which the primes occur . So, for example, we\nregard 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 as the same as 3 × 5 × 7 × 2, or any other possible order in which\nthese primes are written.  This fact is also stated in the following form:\nThe prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the or der\nof its factors .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n4M ATHEMA TICS\nIn general, given a composite number x, we factorise it as x  = p1p2 ... pn, where\np1, p2,..., pn are primes and written in ascending order, i.e., p1  p2\n . . .   pn. If we combine the same primes, we will get powers of primes. For example,\n32760 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13\nOnce we have decided that the order will be ascending, then the way the number\nis factorised, is unique.\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has many applications, both within\nmathematics and in other fields. Let us look at some examples.\nExample 1 :  Consider the numbers 4n, where n is a natural number. Check whether\nthere is any value of n for which 4n ends with the digit zero.\nSolution :  If the number 4n, for any n, were to end with the digit zero, then it would be\ndivisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of 4n would contain the prime 5. This is\nnot possible because 4n = (2)2n; so the only prime in the factorisation of 4n is 2. So, the\nuniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no\nother primes in the factorisation of 4n. So, there is no natural number n for which 4n\nends with the digit zero.\nYou have already learnt how to find the HCF and LCM of two positive integers\nusing the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in earlier classes, without realising it!This method is also called the prime factorisation method . Let us recall this method\nthrough an example.\nExample 2 :  Find the LCM and HCF  of 6 and 20 by the prime factorisation method.\nSolution :  We have : 6 = 2\n1 × 31and 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 = 22 × 51.\nYou can find HCF(6, 20) = 2 and LCM(6, 20) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60, as done in your\nearlier classes.\nNote that HCF(6, 20) = 21 =Product of the smallest power of each common\nprime factor in the numbers.\nLCM (6, 20) = 22 × 31 × 51 =Product of the greatest power of each prime factor ,\ninvolved in the numbers .\nFrom the example above, you might have noticed that HCF(6, 20) × LCM(6, 20)\n= 6 × 20. In fact, we can verify that for any two positive integers a and b,\nHCF ( a, b) × LCM ( a, b) = a × b. We can use this result to find the LCM of two\npositive integers, if we have already found the HCF of the two positive integers.\nExample 3:  Find the HCF of 96 and 404 by the prime factorisation method. Hence,\nfind their LCM.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nREAL NUMBERS 5\nSolution :  The prime factorisation of 96 and 404 gives :\n96 = 25 × 3, 404 = 22 × 101\nTherefore, the HCF of these two integers is 22 = 4.\nAlso, LCM (96, 404) =96 404 96 4049696HCF(96, 404) 4\nExample 4 :  Find the HCF and LCM of 6, 72 and 120, using the prime factorisation\nmethod.\nSolution :  We have :\n6 = 2 × 3, 72 \n= 23 × 32, 120 = 23 × 3 × 5\nHere, 21 and 31 are the smallest powers of the common factors 2 and 3, respectively.\nSo, HCF (6, 72, 120) = 21 × 31 = 2 × 3 = 6\n23, 32 and 51 are the greatest powers of the prime factors 2, 3 and 5 respectively\ninvolved in the three numbers.\nSo, LCM (6, 72, 120) = 23 × 32 × 51 = 360\nRemark :  Notice, 6 × 72 × 120  HCF (6, 72, 120) × LCM (6, 72, 120). So, the\nproduct of three numbers is not equal to the product of their HCF and LCM.\nEXERCISE 1.1\n1.Express each number as a product of its prime factors:\n(i) 140 (ii) 156 (iii) 3825 (iv) 5005 (v) 7429\n2.Find the LCM and HCF of the following pairs of integers and verify that LCM × HCF =\nproduct of the two numbers.\n(i) 26 and 91 (ii)510 and 92 (iii)336 and 54\n3.Find the LCM and HCF of the following integers by applying the prime factorisationmethod.\n(i) 12, 15 and 21 (ii) 17, 23 and 29 (iii) 8, 9 and 25\n4.Given that HCF (306, 657) = 9, find LCM (306, 657).\n5.Check whether 6\nn can end with the digit 0 for any natural number n.\n6.Explain why 7 × 11 × 13 + 13 and 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 + 5 are composite numbers.\n7.There is a circular path around a sports field.

After how many minutes\nwill they meet again at the starting point?\n1.3Revisiting Irrational Numbers\nIn Class IX, you were introduced to irrational numbers and many of their properties.\nYou studied about their existence and how the rationals and the irrationals together\nmade up the real numbers. You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number\nline. However , we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will\nprove that 2 , 3 , 5  and, in general, p is irrational, where p is a prime. One of\nthe theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\nRecall, a number ‘ s’ is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form  ,p\nq\nwhere p and q are integers and q ¹ 0. Some examples of irrational numbers, with\nwhich you are already familiar , are :\n2, 2, 3, 15, , 0.10110111011110 . . .\n3  , etc.\nBefore we prove that 2 is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose\nproof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\nTheor em 1.2 :  Let p be a prime number . If p divides a2, then p divides a, wher e\na is a positive integer .\n*Proof :  Let the prime factorisation of a be as follows :\na = p1p2 . . . pn, where p1,p2, . . ., pn are primes, not necessarily distinct.\nTherefore, a2 = (p1p2 . . . pn)(p1p2 . . . pn) = p2\n1p2\n2 . . . p2\nn.\nNow , we are given that p divides a2. Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of\nArithmetic, it follows that p is one of the prime factors of a2.

{"class": "10", "subject": "math", "chapter": "Chapter 2: polynomials", "content": "10 MATHEMA TICS\n2\n2.1 Introduction\nIn Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall\nthat if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of\nthe polynomial  p(x). For example, 4 x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of\ndegree 1, 2 y2 – 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5 x3 – 4x2 + x – 2\nis a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7 u6 – 423482uu u   is a polynomial\nin the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like 1\n1x, 2x, 21\n23 xx etc., are\nnot polynomials.\nA polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial . For example, 2 x – 3,\n35 ,x 2 y , 2\n11x , 3z + 4, 213u, etc.,  are all linear polynomials. Polynomials\nsuch as 2 x + 5 – x2, x3 + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials.\nA polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial . The name ‘quadratic’\nhas been derived from the word ‘quadrate’, which means ‘square’. 2 2, 235xx\ny2 – 2, 223 ,x x  22 2 2125 , 5 , 433 7uuv v z    are some examples of\nquadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, anyquadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax\n2 + bx  + c, where a, b, c are real numbers\nand a  0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial . Some examples ofPOLYNOMIALS\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 11\na cubic polynomial are 2 – x3, x3, 32,x 3 – x2 + x3, 3x3 – 2x2 + x – 1. In fact, the most\ngeneral form of a cubic polynomial is\nax3 + bx2 + cx + d,\nwhere, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a  0.\nNow consider the polynomial p(x) = x2 – 3x – 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the\npolynomial, we get p(2) = 22 – 3 × 2 – 4 = – 6. The value ‘– 6’, obtained by replacing\nx by 2 in x2 – 3x – 4, is the value of x2 – 3x – 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of\np(x) at x = 0, which is – 4.\nIf p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by\nreplacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(k).\nWhat is the value of p(x) = x2 –3x – 4 at x = –1? We have :\np(–1) = (–1)2 –{3 × (–1)} – 4 = 0\nAlso, note that p(4) = 42 – (3  4) – 4 = 0.\nAs p(–1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, –1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic\npolynomial x2 – 3x – 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a\npolynomial p(x), if p(k) = 0.\nYou have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear\npolynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us\n2k + 3 = 0, i.e., k = 3\n2\nIn general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak + b = 0, i.e., bka\nSo, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is (Constant term)\nCoefficient ofb\nax .\nThus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this\nhappen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial also related to its coefficients?\nIn this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the\ndivision algorithm for polynomials.\n2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial\nYou know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why\nare the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the\ngeometrical  representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical\nmeaning of their zeroes.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n12 MATHEMA TICS\nConsider first a linear polynomial ax + b, a  0. You have studied in Class IX that the\ngraph of y = ax + b is a straight line. For example, the graph of y = 2x  + 3 is a straight\nline passing through the points (– 2, –1) and (2, 7).\nx –2 2\ny = 2x + 3 –1 7\nFrom Fig. 2.1, you can see\nthat the graph of y = 2 x + 3\nintersects the x-axis mid-way\nbetween x = –1 and x  = – 2,\nthat is, at the point 3,02.\nYou also know that the zero of\n2x + 3 is 3\n2. Thus, the zero of\nthe polynomial 2 x + 3 is the\nx-coordinate of the point where the\ngraph of y = 2x  + 3 intersects the\nx-axis.\nIn general, for a linear polynomial ax + b, a  0, the graph of y = ax + b is a\nstraight line which intersects the x-axis at exactly one point, namely, ,0b\na\n.\nTherefore, the linear polynomial ax + b, a  0, has exactly one zero, namely, the\nx-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = ax + b intersects the x-axis.\nNow, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial.\nConsider the quadratic polynomial x2 – 3x – 4. Let us see what the graph * of\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 looks like. Let us list  a few values of y = x2 – 3x – 4 corresponding to\na few values for x as given in Table 2.1.\n*Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students,\nnor is to be evaluated.Fig. 2.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 13\nTable 2.1\nx –  2 – 1 012 3 4 5\ny = x2 – 3x –  46 0–  4–  6–  6 –  4 06\nIf we locate the points listed\nabove on a graph paper and draw\nthe graph, it will actually look like\nthe one given in Fig. 2.2.\nIn fact, for any quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, the\ngraph of the correspondingequation y = ax\n2 + bx + c has one\nof the two shapes either open\nupwards like  or open\ndownwards like  depending on\nwhether a > 0 or a < 0. (These\ncurves are called  parabolas .)\nYou can see from Table 2.1\nthat –1 and 4 are zeroes of the\nquadratic polynomial. Also\nnote from Fig. 2.2 that –1 and 4\nare the x-coordinates of the points\nwhere the graph of y = x2 – 3x – 4\nintersects the x-axis. Thus, the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomialx\n2 – 3x – 4 are x-coordinates of\nthe points where the graph ofy = x\n2 – 3 x – 4 intersects the\nx-axis.\nThis fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the\nparabola representing  y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x-axis.\nFrom our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c, the\nfollowing three cases can happen:Fig. 2.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n14 MATHEMA TICS\nCase (i) :  Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A .\nThe x-coordinates of A and A  are the two zeroes  of the quadratic polynomial\nax2 + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).\nFig. 2.3\nCase (ii) :  Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident\npoints. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point \nA\n(see Fig. 2.4).\nFig. 2.4\nThe x-coordinate of A is the only zero  for the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c\nin this case.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 15\nCase (iii) :  Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below\nthe x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).\nFig. 2.5\nSo, the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c has no zero  in this case.\nSo, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two\ndistinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a\npolynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.\nNow, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic\npolynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x3 – 4x. To see what\nthe graph of y = x3 – 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few\nvalues for x as shown in Table 2.2.\nTable 2.2\nx –2 –1 0 1 2\ny = x3 – 4x 030 – 3 0\nLocating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see\nthat the graph of y = x3 – 4x actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n16 MATHEMA TICS\nWe see from the table above\nthat – 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the\ncubic polynomial x3 – 4x . Observe\nthat – 2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, thex-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x\n3 – 4 x\nintersects the x-axis. Since the curve\nmeets the x-axis in only these 3\npoints, their x-coordinates are the\nonly zeroes of the polynomial.\nLet us take a few more\nexamples. Consider the cubic\npolynomials x3 and x3 – x2. We draw\nthe graphs of y = x3 and y = x3 – x2\nin Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.\nFig. 2.7 Fig. 2.8Fig. 2.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 17\nNote that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial x3. Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see\nthat 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x3 intersects the\nx-axis. Similarly, since x3 – x2 = x2 (x – 1),  0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial\nx3 – x2. Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x3 – x2 intersects the x-axis.\nFrom the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic\npolynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.\nRemark :  In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)\nintersects the x-axis at atmost n points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has\nat most n zeroes.\nExample 1 :  Look at the graphs in Fig. 2.9 given below. Each is the graph of y = p(x),\nwhere p(x) is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of p(x).\nFig. 2.9\nSolution :\n(i)\nThe number of zeroes is 1 as the graph intersects the x-axis at one point only.\n(ii)The number of zeroes is 2 as the graph intersects the x-axis at two points.\n(iii)The number of zeroes is 3.

Find the\nnumber of zeroes of p(x), in each case.\nFig. 2.10\n2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial\nYou have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial ax + b is b\na. We will now try\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,say p(x) = 2 x\n2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2 x\n2 = 12 x2. So, we write\n2x2 – 8x  + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2 x(x – 3) – 2( x – 3)\n=( 2x – 2)( x – 3) = 2( x – 1)( x – 3)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 19\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 or x = 3. So, the zeroes of 2 x2 – 8x + 6 are 1 and 3. Observe that :\nSum of its zeroes =2( 8) (Coefficient of )134\n2 Coefficient ofx\nx  \nProduct of its zeroes =26 Constant term13 3\n2Coefficient of x\nLet us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, p(x) = 3 x2 + 5x – 2. By the\nmethod of splitting the middle term,\n3x2 + 5x  – 2 = 3 x2 + 6x – x – 2 = 3 x(x + 2) –1( x + 2)\n=( 3x – 1)( x + 2)\nHence, the value of 3 x2 + 5x – 2 is zero when either 3 x – 1 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, i.e.,\nwhen x = 1\n3 or x = –2. So, the zeroes of 3 x2 + 5x  – 2 are 1\n3 and – 2.

Therefore,\nax2 + bx + c =k(x – ) (x – ), where k is a constant\n=k[x2 – (  + )x + ]\n=kx2 – k( + )x + k \nComparing the coefficients of x2, x and constant terms on both the sides, we get\na = k, b =–  k( + ) and c = k\nThis gives    +    =–b\na,\n    =c\na\n*,are Greek letters pronounced as ‘alpha’ and ‘beta’ respectively.

Therefore, the zeroes of x2 + 7x + 10 are – 2 and – 5.

She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel\nand play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if\nthe ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she playedHoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs` 3, and a game of Hoopla costs ` 4, how would you find out the number of rides she\nhad and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent ` 20.\nMay be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it\npossible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledgeof Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables.PAIR OF LINEAR  EQUATIONS\nIN TWO VARIABLES\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPAIR OF LINEAR  EQUATIONS  IN TWO VARIABLES 25\nLet us try this approach.\nDenote the number of rides that Akhila had by x, and the number of times she\nplayed Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:\ny =1\n2x (1)\n3x + 4y = 20 (2)\nCan we find the solutions of this pair of equations? There are several ways of\nfinding these, which we will study in this chapter.\n3.2 Graphical Method of Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations\nA pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an inconsistent pair of linear\nequations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a\nconsistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has\ninfinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent  pair of\nlinear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is\nalways consistent.\nWe can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations\nin two variables  and the existence of solutions as follows:\n(i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations\nhas a unique solution (consistent pair of equations).\n(ii)the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution\n(inconsistent pair of equations).\n(iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many\nsolutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations].\nConsider the following three pairs of equations.\n(i)x – 2y  = 0 and 3 x + 4y – 20 = 0 (The lines intersect)\n(ii) 2 x + 3y – 9 = 0 and 4 x + 6y – 18 = 0 (The lines coincide)\n(iii) x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2 x + 4y – 12 = 0 (The lines are parallel)\nLet us now write down, and compare, the values of 11 1\n2 2 2, andab c\nc ab in all the\nthree examples. Here, a1, b1, c1 and a2, b2, c2 denote the coefficents of equations\ngiven in the general form in Section 3.2.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n26 MATHEMA TICS\nTable 3.1\nSlPair of lines1\n2a\na1\n2b\nb1\n2c\ncCompare the Graphical Algebraic\nNo. ratios representation interpretation\n1.x – 2y = 01\n32\n4− 0\n20−1 1\n2 2a b\na b≠Intersecting Exactly one\n3x + 4y – 20 = 0lines solution\n(unique)\n2.2x + 3y – 9 = 02\n43\n69\n18−\n−1 1 1\n2 2 2a b c\na b c= =Coincident Infinitely\n4x + 6y – 18 = 0lines many solutions\n3.x + 2y – 4 = 01\n22\n44\n12−\n−1 1 1\n2 2 2a b c\na b c= ≠Parallel lines No solution\n2x + 4y – 12 = 0\nFrom the table above, you can observe that if the lines represented by the equation\n a1x + b1y + c1 =0\nand a2x + b2y + c2 =0\nare (i)intersecting, then 1 1\n2 2a b\na b≠ ⋅\n(ii)coincident, then 1 1 1\n2 2 2a b c\na b c= = ⋅\n(iii)parallel, then 1 1 1\n2 2 2a b c\na b c= ≠ ⋅\nIn fact, the converse is also true for any pair of lines. You can verify them by\nconsidering some more examples by yourself.\nLet us now consider some more examples to illustrate it.\nExample 1 :  Check graphically whether the pair of equations\nx + 3y =6 (1)\nand 2x – 3y =12 (2)\nis consistent. If so, solve them graphically .\nSolution :  Let us draw the graphs of the Equations (1) and (2). For this, we find two\nsolutions of each of the equations, which are given in Table 3.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPAIR OF LINEAR  EQUA TIONS  IN TWO VARIABLES 27\nFig. 3.1Table 3.2\nx 0 6 x 0 3\ny = 6\n3x−2 0 y = 2 12\n3x−–4 –2\nPlot the points A(0, 2), B(6, 0),\nP(0, – 4) and Q(3, – 2) on graph\npaper , and join the points to form the\nlines AB and PQ as shown in\nFig. 3.1.\nWe observe that there is a point\nB (6, 0) common to both the lines\nAB and PQ. So, the solution of the\npair of linear equations is x = 6 and\ny = 0, i.e., the given pair of equations\nis consistent.\nExample 2 :  Graphically , find whether the following pair of equations has no solution,\nunique solution or infinitely many solutions:\n5x – 8y  + 1 = 0 (1)\n3x – 24\n5y + 3\n5 =0 (2)\nSolution :  Multiplying Equation (2) by 5,\n3 we get\n5x – 8y  + 1 = 0\nBut,  this is the same as Equation (1). Hence the lines represented by Equations (1)\nand (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions.\nPlot few points on the graph and verify it yourself.\nExample 3 :  Champa went to a ‘Sale’ to purchase some pants and skirts. When her\nfriends asked her how many of each she had bought, she answered, “The number of\nskirts is two less than twice the number of pants purchased. Also, the number of skirts\nis four less than four times the number of pants purchased”. Help her friends to find\nhow many pants and skirts Champa bought.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n28 MATHEMA TICS\nSolution :  Let us denote the number of pants by x and the number of skirts by y. Then\nthe equations formed are :\ny =2x – 2 (1)\n and y =4x – 4 (2)\nLet us draw the graphs of\nEquations (1) and (2) by finding two\nsolutions for each of the equations.\nThey are given in Table 3.3.\nTable 3.3\nx 2 0\ny = 2x – 2 2– 2\nx 0 1\ny = 4x – 4 – 4 0\nPlot the points and draw the lines passing through them to represent the equations,\nas shown in Fig. 3.2.\nThe two lines intersect at the point (1, 0). So, x = 1, y = 0 is the required solution\nof the pair of linear equations, i.e., the number of pants she purchased is 1 and she did\nnot buy any skirt.\nVerify the answer by checking whether it satisfies the conditions of the given\nproblem.\nEXERCISE 3.1\n1.Form the pair of linear equations in the following problems, and find their solutions\ngraphically .\n(i)10 students of Class X took part in a Mathematics quiz.

Is there any alternative method of finding the solution? There are\nseveral algebraic methods, which we shall now discuss.\n3.3.1 Substitution Method : We shall explain the method of substitution by taking\nsome examples.\nExample 4 :  Solve the following pair of equations by substitution method:\n7x – 15 y =2 (1)\nx + 2y =3 (2)\nSolution :\nStep 1 :  We pick either of the equations and write one variable in terms of the other .\nLet us consider the Equation (2) :\nx + 2y =3\nand write it as x =3 – 2 y (3)\nStep 2 :  Substitute the value of x in Equation (1). We get\n7(3 – 2 y) – 15 y =2\ni.e., 21 – 14 y – 15 y =2\ni.e., –29y =–19\nTherefore, y =19\n29\nStep 3 :  Substituting this value of y in Equation (3), we get\nx =3 – 19229 \n   = 49\n29\nTherefore, the solution is x = 49\n29, y = 19\n29.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPAIR OF LINEAR  EQUA TIONS  IN TWO VARIABLES 31\nVerification :  Substituting x = 49\n29 and y = 19\n29, you can verify that both the Equations\n(1) and (2) are satisfied.\nTo understand the substitution method more clearly , let us consider it stepwise:\nStep 1 :  Find the value of one variable, say y in terms of the other variable, i.e., x from\neither equation, whichever is convenient.\nStep 2 :  Substitute this value of y in the other equation, and reduce it to an equation in\none variable, i.e., in terms of x, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and\n10 below , you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can\nconclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement\nis false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent.\nStep 3 :  Substitute the value of x (or y) obtained in S tep 2 in the equation used in\nStep 1 to obtain the value of the other variable.\nRemark :  We have substituted  the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of\nthe other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is\nknown as the substitution method .\nExample 5 :  Solve the following question— Aftab tells his daughter , “Seven years\nago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from now , I shall be\nthree times as old as you will be.” (Isn’t this interesting?) Represent this situation\nalgebraically and graphically  by the method of substitution.\nSolution :  Let s and t be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter , respectively .\nThen, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is\ns – 7 = 7 ( t – 7), i.e.,  s – 7t + 42 = 0 (1)\nand s + 3 = 3 ( t + 3), i.e.,  s – 3t = 6 (2)\nUsing Equation (2), we get s = 3t + 6.\nPutting this value of s in Equation (1), we get\n(3t + 6) – 7 t + 42 = 0,\ni.e., 4t =48, which gives t = 12.\nPutting this value of t in Equation (2), we get\ns =3 (12) + 6 = 42\nReprint 2025-26\n\n32 MATHEMA TICS\nSo, Aftab and his daughter are 42 and 12 years old, respectively .\nVerify this answer by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the given problems.\nExample 6 :   In a shop the cost of 2 pencils and 3 erasers is `9 and the cost of 4\npencils and 6 erasers is `18. Find the cost of each pencil and each eraser .\nSolution :  The pair of linear equations formed were:\n2x + 3y =9 (1)\n4x + 6y =18 (2)\nWe first express the value of x in terms of y from the equation 2 x + 3y = 9, to get\nx =9 3\n2y−(3)\nNow we substitute this value of x in Equation (2), to get\n4(9 3 )\n2y− + 6y =18\ni.e., 18 – 6 y + 6y =18\ni.e., 18 = 18\nThis statement is true for all values of y. However , we do not get a specific\nvalue of y as a solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of x. This\nsituation has arisen because both the given equations are the same. Therefore,\nEquations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions. We cannot find a unique\ncost of a pencil and an eraser , because there are many common solutions, to the\ngiven situation.\nExample 7 :  Two rails are represented by the equations\nx + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2 x + 4y – 12 = 0.  Will the rails cross each other?\nSolution :  The pair of linear equations formed were:\nx + 2y – 4 = 0 (1)\n2x + 4y – 12 = 0 (2)\nWe express x in terms of y from Equation (1) to get\nx =4 – 2 y\nNow , we substitute this value of x in Equation (2) to get\n2(4 – 2 y) + 4 y – 12 = 0\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPAIR OF LINEAR  EQUATIONS  IN TWO VARIABLES 33\ni.e., 8 – 12 = 0\ni.e., – 4 = 0\nwhich is a false statement.\nTherefore, the equations do not have a common solution. So, the two rails will not\ncross each other.\nEXERCISE 3.2\n1.Solve the following pair of linear equations by the substitution method.\n(i)x + y = 14 (ii) s – t = 3\nx – y = 4 632st\n(iii) 3 x – y = 3 (iv) 0.2 x + 0.3 y = 1.3\n9x – 3y = 9 0.4x + 0.5 y = 2.3\n(v) 23 0xy (vi)35223xy \n38 0xy13\n32 6xy\n2.Solve 2 x + 3y = 11 and 2 x – 4y = – 24 and hence find the value of ‘ m’ for which\ny = mx + 3.\n3.Form the pair of linear equations for the following problems and find their solution by\nsubstitution method.\n(i) The difference between two numbers is 26 and one number is three times the other.\nFind them.\n(ii)The larger of two supplementary angles exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees.

What are their present ages?\n3.3.2 Elimination Method\nNow let us consider another method of eliminating (i.e., removing) one variable. This\nis sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method\nworks.\nExample 8 :  The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their\nexpenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ` 2000 per month, find their\nmonthly incomes.\nSolution :  Let us denote the incomes of the two person by ` 9x and ` 7x and their\nexpenditures by ` 4y and ` 3y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation\nis given by :\n9x – 4y = 2000 (1)\nand 7 x – 3y = 2000 (2)\nStep 1 :  Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coef ficients of\ny equal. Then we get the equations:\n27x – 12 y = 6000 (\n3)\n28x – 12 y = 8000 (4)\nStep 2 :  Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate  y, because the coef ficients\nof y are the same. So, we get\n(28x – 27x ) – (12 y – 12\ny) = 8000 – 6000\ni.e., x = 2000\nStep 3 :  Substituting this value of x in (1), we get\n9(2000) – 4 y =2000\ni.e., y = 4000\nSo, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, y = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes\nof the persons are ` 18,000 and ` 14,000, respectively.\nVerification :  18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures =\n18000 – 2000 : 14000 – 2000 = 16000 : 12000 = 4 : 3\nRemarks :\n1.\nThe method used in solving the example above is called the elimination method,\nbecause we eliminate one variable first, to get a linear equation in one variable.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPAIR OF LINEAR  EQUATIONS  IN TWO VARIABLES 35\nIn the example above, we eliminated y. We could also have eliminated x. Try\ndoing it that way.\n2. You could also have used the substitution, or graphical method, to solve this\nproblem. Try doing so, and see which method is more convenient.\nLet us now note down these steps in the elimination method :\nStep 1 : First multiply both the equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make\nthe coefficients of one variable (either x or y) numerically equal.\nStep 2 :  Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets\neliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3.\nIf in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original\npair of equations has infinitely many solutions.\nIf in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original\npair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent.\nStep 3 :  Solve the equation in one variable ( x or y) so obtained to get its value.\nStep 4 :  Substitute this value of x (or y) in either of the original equations to get the\nvalue of the other variable.Now to illustrate it, we shall solve few more examples.\nExample 9 :  Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following pair\nof linear equations :\n2x + 3y =8 (1)\n4x + 6y =7 (2)\nSolution :\nStep 1 :  Multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 1 to make the\ncoefficients of x equal. Then we get the equations as :\n4x + 6y = 16 (3)\n4x + 6y =\n7 (4)\nStep 2 :  Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3),\n(4x – 4x) + (6y  – 6y) =16 – 7\ni.e., 0\n = 9, which is a false statement.\nTherefore, the pair of equations has no solution.\nExample 10 :  The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing\nthe digits is 66. If the digits of the number differ by 2, find the number .

{"class": "10", "subject": "math", "chapter": "Chapter 4: quadratic equations", "content": "38 MATHEMA TICS\n4\n4.1 Introduction\nIn Chapter 2, you have studied different types of polynomials. One type was the\nquadratic polynomial of the form ax2 + bx + c, a  0. When we equate this polynomial\nto zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal withmany real-life situations. For instance, suppose acharity trust decides to build a prayer hall havinga carpet area of 300 square metres with its lengthone metre more than twice its breadth. Whatshould be the length and breadth of the hall?Suppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then,\nits length should be (2 x + 1) metres. We can depict\nthis information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1.\nNow, area of the hall = (2 x + 1). x m\n2 = (2 x2 + x) m2\nSo, 2x2 + x = 300 (Given)\nTherefore, 2 x2 + x – 300 = 0\nSo, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 which is a\nquadratic equation.\nMany people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations.\nFor instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum\nand a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadraticequation of the form x\n2 – px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a\ngeometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology,are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, isoften credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598–665)gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax\n2 + bx = c. Later,QUADRATIC  EQUATIONS\nFig. 4.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\nQUADRA TIC  EQUA TIONS 39\nSridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula,\n(as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completingthe square. An  Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studiedquadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions ofdifferent quadratic equations.\nIn this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding\ntheir roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily lifesituations.\n4.2 Quadratic Equations\nA quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where\na, b, c are real numbers, a  0. For example, 2 x2 + x – 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation.\nSimilarly, 2 x2 – 3x + 1 = 0, 4 x – 3x2 + 2 = 0 and 1 – x2 + 300 = 0 are also quadratic\nequations.\nIn fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree\n2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of\ntheir degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax2 + bx + c = 0,\na  0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation .\nQuadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in\ndifferent fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples.\nExample 1 :  Represent the following situations mathematically:\n(i)\nJohn and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and\nthe product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find\nout how many marbles they had to start with.\n(ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of\nproduction of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toysproduced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was` 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.\nSolution :\n(i) Let the number of marbles John had be x.\nThen the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 – x (Why?).\nThe number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x – 5\nThe number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 – x – 5\n= 40 – x\nReprint 2025-26\n\n40 MATHEMA TICS\nTherefore, their product = ( x – 5) (40 – x)\n=4 0 x – x2 – 200 + 5 x\n=–  x2 + 45 x – 200\nSo, – x2 + 45 x – 200 = 124 (Given that product = 124)\ni.e., – x2 + 45 x – 324 = 0\ni.e., x2 – 45 x + 324 = 0\nTherefore, the number of marbles John had, satisfies the quadratic equation\nx2 – 45 x + 324 = 0\nwhich is the required representation of the problem mathematically.\n(ii)Let the number of toys produced on that day be x.\nTherefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day = 55 – x\nSo, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day = x (55 – x)\nTherefore, x (55 – x) = 750\ni.e., 55 x – x2 = 750\ni.e., – x2 + 55 x – 750 = 0\ni.e., x2 – 55 x + 750 = 0\nTherefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation\nx2 – 55 x + 750 = 0\nwhich is the required representation of the problem mathematically.\nExample 2 :  Check whether the following are quadratic equations:\n(i) (x – 2)2 + 1 = 2 x – 3 (ii) x(x + 1) + 8 = ( x + 2) ( x – 2)\n(iii)x (2x + 3) = x2 + 1 (iv) ( x + 2)3 = x3 – 4\nSolution :\n(i) LHS = ( x – 2)2 + 1 = x2 – 4x  + 4 + 1 = x2 – 4x + 5\nTherefore, ( x – 2)2 + 1 = 2x  – 3 can be rewritten as\nx2 – 4x + 5 = 2 x – 3\ni.e., x2 – 6x + 8 = 0\nIt is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.\nTherefore, the given equation is a quadratic equation.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nQUADRA TIC  EQUA TIONS 41\n(ii) Since x(x + 1) + 8 = x2 + x + 8 and ( x + 2)( x – 2) = x2 – 4\nTherefore, x2 + x + 8 = x2 – 4\ni.e., x + 12 = 0\nIt is not of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.\nTherefore, the given equation is not a quadratic equation.\n(iii) Here, LHS = x (2x + 3) = 2x2 + 3x\nSo, x (2x + 3) = x2 + 1 can be rewritten as\n2x2 + 3x =x2 + 1\nTherefore, we get x2 + 3x – 1 = 0\nIt is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.\nSo, the given equation is a quadratic equation.\n(iv) Here, LHS = ( x + 2)3 =x3 + 6x2 + 12 x + 8\nTherefore, ( x + 2)3 =x3 – 4 can be rewritten as\nx3 + 6x2 + 12 x + 8 = x3 – 4\ni.e., 6 x2 + 12 x + 12 = 0 or, x2 + 2x + 2 = 0\nIt is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.\nSo, the given equation is a quadratic equation.\nRemark :  Be careful! In (ii) above, the given equation appears to be a quadratic\nequation, but it is not a quadratic equation.\nIn (iv) above, the given equation appears to be a cubic equation (an equation of\ndegree 3) and not a quadratic equation. But it turns out to be a quadratic equation. As\nyou can see, often we need to simplify the given equation before deciding whether it\nis quadratic or not.\nEXERCISE 4.1\n1.Check whether the following are quadratic equations :\n(i) (x + 1)2 = 2(x – 3) (ii) x2 – 2x = (–2) (3 –  x)\n(iii) ( x – 2)( x + 1) = ( x – 1)(x  + 3) (iv) ( x – 3)(2 x +1) = x(x + 5)\n(v) (2 x – 1)(x  – 3) = (x  + 5)( x – 1) (vi) x2 + 3x + 1 = ( x – 2)2\n(vii) ( x + 2)3 = 2x (x2 – 1) (viii) x3 – 4x2 – x + 1 = ( x – 2)3\n2.Represent the following situations in the form of quadratic equations :\n(i) The area of a rectangular plot is 528 m2.

We would like to find Rohan’s present age.\n(iv) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been\n8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. Weneed to find the speed of the train.\n4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation\nConsider the quadratic equation 2 x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. If we replace x by 1 on the\nLHS of this equation, we get (2 × 12) – (3 × 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation.\nWe say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that\n1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2 x2 – 3x + 1.\nIn general, a real number  is called a root of the quadratic equation\nax2 + bx + c = 0, a  0 if a 2 + b + c = 0. We also say that x =    is a solution of\nthe quadratic equation , or that    satisfies the quadratic equation . Note that  the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic\nequation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are the same .\nYou have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most\ntwo zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.\nYou have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting\ntheir middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic\nequation. Let us see how.\nExample 3 :  Find the roots of the equation 2 x2 – 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation.\nSolution :  Let us first split the middle term – 5 x as –2 x –3x [because (–2 x) × (–3 x) =\n6x2 = (2 x2) × 3].\nSo, 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 2 x2 – 2x – 3x + 3 = 2 x (x – 1) –3( x – 1) = (2 x – 3)(x  – 1)\nNow, 2 x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2 x – 3)( x – 1) = 0.\nSo, the values of x for which 2 x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2 x – 3)( x – 1) = 0,\ni.e., either 2 x – 3 = 0 or x – 1 = 0.\nNow, 2 x – 3 = 0 gives 3\n2x and x – 1 = 0 gives x = 1.\nSo, 32x\n and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation.\nIn other words, 1 and 32 are the roots of the equation 2 x2 – 5x + 3 = 0.\nVerify  that these are the roots of the given equation.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nQUADRA TIC  EQUA TIONS 43\nNote that we have found the roots of  2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 by factorising\n2x2 – 5x + 3 into two linear factors and equating each factor to zero .\nExample 4 :  Find the roots of the quadratic equation 6 x2 – x – 2 = 0.\nSolution :  We have\n6x2 – x – 2 = 6 x2 + 3x – 4x – 2\n=3x (2x + 1) – 2 (2 x + 1)\n=( 3x – 2)(2 x + 1)\nThe roots of 6 x2 – x – 2 = 0 are the values of x for which (3 x – 2)(2 x + 1) = 0\nTherefore, 3 x – 2 = 0 or 2 x + 1 = 0,\ni.e., x =2\n3orx = 1\n2\nTherefore, the roots of 6 x2 – x – 2 = 0 are 21. and –32\nWe verify the roots, by checking that 21and32 satisfy 6 x2 – x – 2 = 0.\nExample 5 :  Find the roots of the quadratic equation 232 6 2 0xx  .\nSolution :232 6 2xx  =236 6 2xx x\n=  33 2 2 3 2xx x \n= 32 3 2xx\nSo, the roots of the equation are the values of x for which\n 32 3 2 0xx \nNow, 32 0x  for 2\n3x .\nSo, this root is repeated twice, one for each repeated factor 32x .\nTherefore, the roots of 232 6 2 0xx   are 23, 23.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n44 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 6 :  Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 4.1.\nSolution :  In Section 4.1, we found that if the breadth of the hall is x m, then x\nsatisfies the equation 2 x2 + x – 300 = 0. Applying the factorisation method, we write\nthis equation as\n2x2 – 24 x + 25 x – 300 = 0\n2x (x – 12) + 25 ( x – 12) = 0\ni.e., ( x – 12)(2 x + 25) = 0\nSo, the roots of the given equation are x = 12 or x = – 12.5. Since x is the breadth\nof the hall, it cannot be negative.\nThus, the breadth of the hall is 12 m. Its length = 2 x + 1 = 25 m.\nEXERCISE 4.2\n1.Find the roots of the following quadratic equations by factorisation:\n(i)x2 – 3x – 10 = 0 (ii) 2 x2 + x – 6 = 0\n(iii)227 5 2 0xx  (iv) 2 x2 – x + 1\n8 = 0\n(v) 100 x2 – 20x + 1 = 0\n2.Solve the problems given in Example 1.\n3.Find two numbers whose sum is 27 and product is 182.\n4.Find two consecutive positive integers, sum of whose squares is 365.\n5.The altitude of a right triangle is 7 cm less than its base.

Therefore,\nthere are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case.\nSince b2 – 4ac determines whether the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has\nreal roots or not, b2 – 4ac is called the discriminant  of this quadratic equation.\nSo, a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has\n(i) two distinct real roots, if b2 – 4ac > 0,\n(ii) two equal real roots, if b2 – 4ac = 0,\n(iii) no real roots, if b2 – 4ac < 0.\nLet us consider some examples.\nExample 7 : Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2 x2 – 4x + 3 = 0, and\nhence find the nature of its roots.\nSolution :  The given equation is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 2, b = – 4 and\nc = 3. Therefore, the discriminant\nb2 – 4ac = (– 4)2 – (4 × 2 × 3) = 16 – 24 = – 8 < 0\nSo, the given equation has no real roots.\nExample 8 :  A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of\ndiameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two\ndiametrically opposite fixed gates A\n and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to\ndo so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the pole be erected?\nSolution :  Let us first draw the diagram\n(see Fig. 4.2).\nLet P be the required location of the\npole. Let the distance of the pole from the\ngate B be x m, i.e., BP = x m. Now the\ndifference of the distances of the pole fromthe two gates = AP  – BP\n (or, BP – AP) =\n7 m. Therefore, AP = ( x + 7) m.\nFig. 4.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n46 MATHEMA TICS\nNow, AB = 13m, and since AB is a diameter,\nAPB = 90° (Why?)\nTherefore, AP2 + PB2 =A B2(By Pythagoras theorem)\ni.e., ( x + 7)2 + x2 =1 32\ni.e., x2 + 14 x + 49 + x2 = 169\ni.e., 2x2 + 14 x – 120 = 0\nSo, the distance ‘ x’ of the pole from gate B satisfies the equation\nx2 + 7x – 60 = 0\nSo,  it would be possible to place the pole if this equation has real roots. To see if this\nis so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is\nb2 – 4ac = 72 – 4 × 1 × (– 60) = 289 > 0.\nSo, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the\npole on the boundary of the park.\nSolving the quadratic equation x2 + 7x – 60 = 0, by the quadratic formula, we get\nx =72 8 9\n2 = 71 7\n2\nTherefore, x = 5 or – 12.\nSince x is the distance between the pole and the gate B, it must be positive.\nTherefore, x = – 12 will have to be ignored. So, x  = 5.\nThus, the pole has to be erected on the boundary of the park at a distance of 5m\nfrom the gate B and 12m from the gate A.\nExample 9 :  Find the discriminant of the equation 3 x2 – 2x +1\n3 = 0 and hence find the\nnature of its roots.

In some, we find that the\nsucceeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number, in other by multiplying\nwith a fixed number, in another we find that they are squares of consecutivenumbers, and so on.\nIn this chapter, we shall discuss one of these patterns in which succeeding terms\nare obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. We shall also see howto find their nth terms and the sum of n consecutive terms, and use this knowledge in\nsolving some daily life problems.\n5.2 Arithmetic Progressions\nConsider the following lists of numbers :\n(i) 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .\n(ii)100, 70, 40, 10, . . .\n(iii) – 3, –2, –1, 0, . . .\n(iv) 3, 3, 3, 3, . . .\n(v) –1.0, –1.5, –2.0, –2.5, . . .\nEach of the numbers in the list is called a  term.\nGiven a term, can you write the next term in each of the lists above? If so, how\nwill you write it? Perhaps by following a pattern or rule. Let us observe and write therule.\nIn (i), each term is 1 more than the term preceding it.\nIn (ii), each term is 30 less than the term preceding it.In (iii), each term is obtained by adding 1 to  the term preceding it.\nIn (iv), all the terms in the list are 3 , i.e., each term is obtained by adding\n(or subtracting) 0 to the term preceding it.\nIn (v), each term is obtained by adding – 0.5 to (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from) the\nterm preceding it.\nIn all the lists above, we see that successive terms are obtained by adding a fixed\nnumber to the preceding terms. Such list of numbers is said to form an  Arithmetic\nProgression ( AP ) .\nSo, an arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term  is\nobtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first\nterm.\nThis fixed number  is called the  common difference  of the AP. Remember that\nit can be positive, negative or zero .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n52 MATHEMA TICS\nLet us denote the first term of an AP by a1, second term by a2, . . ., nth term by\nan and the common difference by d. Then the AP becomes a1, a2, a3, . . ., an.\nSo, a2 – a1 = a3 – a2 = . . . = an – an – 1 = d.\nSome more examples of AP are:\n(a) The heights ( in cm ) of some students of a school standing in a queue in the\nmorning assembly are 147 , 148, 149, . . ., 157.\n(b) The minimum temperatures ( in degree celsius ) recorded for a week in the\nmonth of January in a city, arranged in ascending order are\n– 3.1, – 3.0, – 2.9, – 2.8, – 2.7, – 2.6, – 2.5\n(c) The balance money ( in ` ) after paying 5 % of the total  loan of ` 1000 every\nmonth is 950, 900, 850, 800, . . ., 50.\n(d) The cash prizes ( in ` ) given by a school to the toppers of Classes I to XII are,\nrespectively, 200, 250, 300, 350, . . ., 750.\n(e) The total savings (in `) after every month for 10 months when ` 50 are saved\neach month are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500.\nIt is left as an exercise for you to explain why each of the lists above is an AP .\nYou can see that\na, a + d , a + 2d, a + 3d, . . .\nrepresents an arithmetic progression where a is the first term and d the common\ndifference. This is called the general form of an AP.\nNote that in examples (a) to (e) above, there are only a finite number of terms.\nSuch an AP is called a finite AP. Also note that each of these Arithmetic Progressions\n(APs) has a last term. The APs in examples (i) to (v) in this section, are not finite APs\nand so they are called infinite Arithmetic Progressions . Such APs do not have a\nlast term.\nNow, to know about an AP, what is the minimum information that you need? Is it\nenough to know the first term? Or, is it enough to know only the common difference?You will find that you will need to know both – the first term a and the common\ndifference d.\nFor instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 3, then\nthe AP is\n 6, 9,12, 15, . . .\nand if a is 6 and d is – 3, then the AP is\n6, 3, 0, –3, . . .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nARITHMETIC  PROGRESSIONS 53\nSimilarly, when\na = – 7, d = – 2, the AP is  – 7, – 9, – 11, – 13, . . .\na =  1.0, d = 0.1, the AP is  1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, . . .\na =  0, d = 11\n2, the AP is  0,  11\n2, 3, 41\n2, 6, . . .\na = 2, d = 0, the AP is  2, 2, 2, 2, . . .\nSo, if you know what a and d are, you can list the AP. What about the other way\nround? That is, if you are given a list of numbers can you say that it is an AP and then\nfind a and d? Since a is the first term, it can easily be written. We know that in an AP ,\nevery succeeding term is obtained by adding d to the preceding term. So, d found by\nsubtracting any term from its succeeding term, i.e., the term which immediately followsit should be same for an AP .\nFor example, for the list of numbers :\n6, 9, 12, 15, . . . ,\nWe have a\n2 – a1 = 9  – 6 = 3,\na3 – a2 = 12 – 9 = 3,\na4 – a3 = 15 – 12 = 3\nHere the difference of any two consecutive terms in each case is 3. So, the\ngiven list is an AP whose first term a is 6 and common difference d is 3.\nFor the list of numbers : 6, 3, 0, – 3, . . .,\na2 – a1 = 3 – 6 = – 3\na3 – a2 = 0 – 3 = – 3\na4 – a3 = –3 – 0  = –3\nSimilarly this is also an AP whose first term is 6 and the common difference\nis –3.\nIn general, for an AP a1, a2, . . ., an, we have\nd =ak + 1 – ak\nwhere  ak + 1  and ak  are the (  k + 1)th and the kth terms respectively.\nTo obtain d in a given AP, we need not find all of a2 – a1, a3 – a2, a4 – a3, . . . .\nIt is enough to find only one of them.\nConsider the list of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . . . By looking at it, you can tell that the\ndifference between any two consecutive terms is not the same. So, this is not an AP .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n54 MATHEMA TICS\nNote that to find d in the AP : 6, 3, 0, – 3, . . ., we have subtracted 6 from 3\nand not 3 from 6, i.e., we should subtract the  kth term from the ( k + 1) th term\neven if the ( k + 1) th term is smaller.\nLet us make the concept more clear through some examples.\nExample 1 :  For the AP : 3\n2, 1\n2, – 1\n2, – 32 , . . ., write the first term a and the\ncommon difference d.\nSolution :  Here, a =32, d =1\n2 – 32 = – 1.\nRemember that we can find  d using any two consecutive terms, once we know that\nthe numbers are in AP .\nExample 2 :  Which of the following list of numbers form an AP? If they form an A P,\nwrite the next two terms :\n(i) 4, 10, 16, 22, . . . (ii) 1, – 1, – 3, – 5, . . .\n(iii) – 2, 2, – 2, 2, – 2, . . .

She has been offered the job with a starting monthly salary of\n` 8000, with an annual increment of ` 500. What would be her monthly salary for the\nfifth year?\nTo answer this, let us first see what her monthly salary for the second year\nwould be.\nIt would be ` (8000 + 500) = ` 8500. In the same way, we can find the monthly\nsalary for the 3rd, 4th and 5th year by adding ` 500 to the salary of the previous year.\nSo, the salary for the 3rd year = ` (8500 + 500)\n=` (8000 + 500 + 500)\n=` (8000 + 2 × 500)\n=` [8000 + (3 – 1)  × 500] (for the 3rd year )\n=` 9000\nSalary for the 4th year   = ` (9000 + 500)\n=` (8000 + 500 + 500 + 500)\n=` (8000 + 3 × 500)\n=` [8000 + (4 – 1) × 500] (for the 4th year )\n=` 9500\nSalary for the 5th year    = ` (9500 + 500)\n=` (8000+500+500+500 + 500)\n=` (8000 + 4 × 500)\n=` [8000 + (5 – 1)  × 500] (for the 5th year )\n=` 10000\nObserve that we are getting a list of numbers\n8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, . . .\nThese numbers are in AP.

And, assuming that she will still be working in the job,\nwhat about the monthly salary for the 25th year? You would calculate this by adding\n` 500 each time to the salary of the previous year to give the answer. Can we make\nthis process shorter? Let us see. You may have already got some idea from the way\nwe have obtained the salaries above.\nSalary for the 15th year\n=  Salary for the 14th year + ` 500\n=  \n=  ` [8000 + 14 × 500]\n=  ` [8000 + (15 – 1) × 500] = ` 15000\ni.e., First salary + (15 – 1) × Annual increment.\nIn the same way, her monthly salary for the 25th year would be\n` [8000 + (25 – 1)  × 500] = ` 20000\n= First salary + (25 – 1)  × Annual increment\nThis example would have given you some idea about how to write the 15th term,\nor the 25th term, and more generally, the nth term of the AP .\nLet a1, a2, a3, . . . be an AP whose first term a1 is a and the common\ndifference is d.\nThen,\nthe second term a2 =a + d = a + (2 – 1)  d\nthe third  term a3 =a2 + d = (a + d) + d = a + 2d = a + (3 – 1 ) d\nthe fourth  term a4 =a3 + d = (a + 2d) + d = a + 3d = a + (4 – 1)  d\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\nLooking at the pattern, we can say that the nth term an = a + (n – 1) d.\nSo, the nth term an of the AP with first term a and common difference d is\ngiven by an = a + (n – 1) d.  \nReprint 2025-26\n\n58 MATHEMA TICS\nan is also called the general term of the AP .

Also, is any term 0? Give\nreason for your answer.\nSolution : Here, a = 21, d = 18 – 21 = – 3 a n dan = – 81, and we have to find n.\nAs an =a + ( n – 1) d,\nwe have – 81 = 21 + ( n – 1)(– 3)\n– 81 = 24 – 3 n\n– 105 = – 3 n\nSo, n = 35\nTherefore, the 35th term of the given AP is – 81.Next, we want to know if there is any n for which a\nn = 0. If such an n is there, then\n21 + ( n – 1) (–3) = 0,\ni.e., 3( n – 1) = 21\ni.e., n =8\nSo, the eighth term is 0.\nExample 5 :  Determine the AP  whose 3rd term is 5 and the 7th term is 9.\nSolution :  We have\na3 = a + (3 – 1) d =a + 2d = 5 (1)\nand a7 = a + (7 – 1) d =a + 6d = 9 (2)\nSolving the pair of linear equations (1) and (2), we get\na =3 , d = 1\nHence, the required AP is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nARITHMETIC  PROGRESSIONS 59\nExample 6 :  Check whether 301 is a term of the list of numbers 5, 11, 17, 23, . . .\nSolution :  We have :\na2 – a1 = 11 – 5 = 6, a3 – a2 = 17 – 11 = 6, a4 – a3 = 23 – 17 = 6\nAs ak + 1 – ak is the same for k = 1, 2, 3, etc., the given list of numbers is an AP.\nNow, a = 5 and d = 6.\nLet 301 be a term, say, the nth term of this AP.\nWe know that\nan =a + (n – 1) d\nSo, 301 = 5 + ( n – 1) × 6\ni.e., 301 = 6 n – 1\nSo, n =302 151\n63\nBut n should be a positive integer (Why?).

How muchmoney will be collected in the moneybox by the time her daughter is 21years old?\nHere, the amount of money (in \n`) put in the money box on her first, second, third,\nfourth . . . birthday were respectively 100, 150, 200, 250, . . . till her 21st birthday. Tofind the total amount in the money box on her 21st birthday, we will have to write eachof the 21 numbers in the list above and then add them up. Don’t you think it would bea tedious and time consuming process? Can we make the process shorter? This wouldbe possible if we can find a method for getting this sum. Let us see.\nWe consider the problem given to Gauss (about whom you read in\nChapter 1), to solve when he was just 10 years old. He was asked to find the sum ofthe positive integers from 1 to 100. He immediately replied that the sum is 5050. Canyou guess how did he do? He wrote :\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 99 + 100\nAnd then, reversed the numbers to write\nS = 100 + 99 + . . . + 3 + 2 + 1\nAdding these two, he got\n2S = (100 + 1) + (99 + 2) + . . . + (3 + 98) + (2 + 99) + (1 + 100)\n= 101 + 101 + . . . + 101 + 101 (100 times)\nSo, S =\n100 10150502 , i.e., the sum = 5050.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n64 MATHEMA TICS\nWe will now use the same technique to find the sum of the first n terms of an AP :\na, a + d, a + 2d , . . .\nThe nth term of this AP is a + (n – 1) d. Let S denote the sum of the first n terms\nof the AP. We have\nS = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + . . . + [ a + (n – 1) d] (1)\nRewriting the terms in reverse order, we have\nS = [a  + (n – 1) d] + [a  + (n – 2) d] + . . . + ( a + d) + a (2)\nOn adding (1) and (2), term-wise. we get\n2S = [2 ( 1) ] [2 ( 1) ] ...

The amount\nof money (in Rs) in the money box of Shakila’s daughter on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th birthday,\n. . ., were 100, 150, 200, 250, . . ., respectively.\nThis is an AP. We have to find the total money collected on her 21st birthday, i.e.,\nthe sum of the first 21 terms of this AP .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nARITHMETIC  PROGRESSIONS 65\nHere, a = 100, d = 50 and n = 21.

We\nwrite S20 to denote the sum of the first 20 terms of an AP . The formula for the sum of\nthe first n terms involves four quantities S, a, d and n . If we know any three of them,\nwe can find the fourth.Remark :  The nth term of an A P\n  is the difference of the sum to first n terms and the\nsum to first ( n – 1) terms of it, i.e., an = Sn – Sn – 1.\nLet us consider some examples.\nExample 11 : Find the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP : 8, 3, –2, . . .Solution : Here, a = 8, d = 3 – 8 = –5, n = 22.\nWe know that\nS= \n2(1 )2nan d\nTherefore, S = 2216 21 ( 5)2  = 11(16 – 105) = 11(–89) = – 979\nSo, the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP is – 979.\nExample 12 :  If the sum of the first 14 terms of an AP is 1050 and its first term is 10,\nfind the 20th term.\nSolution : Here, S14 = 1050, n = 14, a = 10.\nAs Sn =2(1 )2nan d ,\nso, 1050 = 1420 132d= 140 + 91 d\nReprint 2025-26\n\n66 MATHEMA TICS\ni.e., 910 = 91 d\nor, d =1 0\nTherefore, a20 = 10 + (20 – 1) × 10 = 200, i.e. 20th term is 200.\nExample 13 : How many terms of the AP : 24, 21, 18, . . . must be taken so that their\nsum is 78?\nSolution : Here, a  = 24, d = 21 – 24 = –3, Sn = 78. We need to find n.\nWe know that Sn =2(1 )2nan d\nSo, 78 =48 ( 1)( 3)2nn  = 51 32nn\nor 3n2 – 51n  + 156 = 0\nor n2 – 17 n + 52 = 0\nor ( n – 4)( n – 13) = 0\nor n =4o r1 3\nBoth values of n are admissible. So, the number of terms is either 4 or 13.\nRemarks:\n1. In this case, the sum of the first 4 terms = the sum of the first 13 terms = 78.2.T\nwo answers are possible because the sum of the terms from 5th to 13th will be\nzero. This is because a is positive and d  is negative, so that some terms will be\npositive and some others negative, and will cancel out each other.\nExample 14 :  Find the sum of :\n(i)\nthe first 1000 positive integers (ii) the first n positive integers\nSolution :\n(i) Let S = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 1000\nUsing the formula  Sn = ()2nal  for the sum of the first n  terms of an AP , we\nhave\nS1000 =1000(1 1000)2  = 500 × 1001 = 500500\nSo, the sum of the first 1000 positive integers is 500500.\n(ii)Let Sn = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n\nHere a = 1 and the last term l is n.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nARITHMETIC  PROGRESSIONS 67\nTherefore, Sn =(1 )\n2nnor  Sn = (1 )\n2nn\nSo,  the sum of first n  positive integers is given by\nSn = (+ 1 )\n2nn\nExample 15 : Find the sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers whose nth term is\ngiven by\nan = 3 + 2 n\nSolution :\nAs an =3  +  2 n,\nso, a1 = 3 + 2 = 5\na2 = 3 + 2 × 2 = 7\na3 = 3 + 2 × 3 = 9\n\nList of numbers becomes 5, 7, 9, 11, . . .Here, 7 – 5 = 9 – 7 = 11 – 9 = 2 and so on.\nSo, it forms an AP with common difference d = 2.\nTo find S\n24, we have n = 24, a = 5, d = 2.\nTherefore, S24 =2425 ( 2 41 )22   =  12 10 46  = 672\nSo, sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers is 672.\nExample 16 : A manufacturer of TV sets produced 600 sets in the third year and 700\nsets in the seventh year . \nAssuming that the production increases uniformly by a fixed\nnumber every year, find :\n(i) the production in the 1st year (ii)the production in the 10th year\n(iii)the total production in first 7 years\nSolution :  (i) Since the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year,\nthe number of TV sets manufactured in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., years will form an A\nP .\nLet us denote the number of TV sets manufactured in the nth year by an.\nThen, a3 = 600  and a7 = 700\nReprint 2025-26\n\n68 MATHEMA TICS\nor, a + 2d = 600\nand a + 6d = 700\nSolving these equations, we get d = 25 and a = 550.\nTherefore, production of TV sets in the first year is 550.\n(ii) Now a10 =a + 9d = 550 + 9 × 25 = 775\nSo, production of TV sets in the 10th year is 775.\n(iii) Also, S7 =72 550 (7 1) 252  \n=71100 1502  = 4375\nThus, the total production of TV sets in first 7 years is 4375.\nEXERCISE 5.3\n1.Find the sum of the following APs:\n(i) 2, 7, 12, . . ., to 10 terms.

{"class": "10", "subject": "math", "chapter": "Chapter 6: triangles", "content": "TRIANGLES 73\n6\n6.1 Introduction\nYou are familiar with triangles and many of their properties from your earlier classes.\nIn Class IX, you have studied congruence of triangles in detail. Recall that two figuresare said to be congruent , if they have the same shape and the same size. In this\nchapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarilythe same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size)are called similar figures.  In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and\napply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier.\nCan you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of\nsome long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these haveTRIANGLES\nReprint 2025-26\n\n74 MATHEMA TICS\nbeen measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights\nand distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is\nbased on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3\nand also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book).\n6.2 Similar Figures\nIn Class IX, you have seen that all circles with the same radii are congruent, all\nsquares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the\nsame side lengths are congruent.\nNow consider any two (or more)\ncircles [see Fig. 6.1 (i)]. Are theycongruent? Since all of them do nothave the same radius, they are not\ncongruent to each other. Note that\nsome are congruent and some are not,but all of them have the same shape.\nSo they all are, what we call, similar .\nTwo similar figures have the same\nshape but not necessarily the same\nsize. Therefore, all circles are similar.\nWhat about two (or more) squares ortwo (or more) equilateral triangles\n[see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]? As observed\nin the case of circles, here also allsquares are similar and all equilateral\ntriangles are similar.\nFrom the above,  we can say\nthat all congruent figures are\nsimilar but the similar figures need\nnot be congruent.\nCan a circle and a square be\nsimilar? Can a triangle and a square\nbe similar? These questions can beanswered by just looking at thefigures (see Fig. 6.1). Evidentlythese figures are not similar. (Why?)\nFig. 6.1\nFig. 6.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 75\nWhat can you say about the two quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS\n(see Fig 6.2)?Are they similar? These  figures appear to be similar but we cannot be\ncertain about it.Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures andbased on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similaror not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:\nFig. 6.3\nYou will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument\n(Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. \nWould you say that the three photographs  are\nsimilar? Yes,they are.\nWhat can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same\nperson one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are thesephotographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they arenot of the same shape. So, they are not similar.\nWhat does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes\nfrom the same negative? You must  have heard about the stamp size, passport size andpostcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, sayof 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if weconsider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line\nsegment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be\n45\n3555or35\n of that of the line segment.\nThis really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged\n(increased) in the ratio  35:45 (or 35:55).  It can also be said that every line segment\nof the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further,if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segmentsin the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles)are always equal.  This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular\nof two polygons. We say that:\nTwo polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their\ncorresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the\nsame ratio (or proportion ).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n76 MATHEMA TICS\nNote that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale\nfactor (or the Representative Fraction ) for the polygons. You must have heard that\nworld maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are\nprepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.\nIn order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following\nactivity:\nActivity 1 :   Place a lighted bulb at a\npoint O on the ceiling  and directly below\nit a table in your classroom. Let us cut apolygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, froma plane cardboard and place thiscardboard parallel to the ground betweenthe lighted bulb  and the table. Then ashadow of ABCD is cast on the table.\nMark the outline of this shadow asABCD (see Fig.6.4).\nNote that the quadrilateral \nABCD  is\nan enlargement (or magnification) of  thequadrilateral ABCD. This is because ofthe property of light that light propogatesin a straight line. You may also note thatA lies on ray OA, B  lies on ray OB, C \nlies on  OC and D  lies on OD.  Thus, quadrilaterals A BCD  and ABCD are of the\nsame shape but of different sizes.\nSo, quadrilateral  A BCD  is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say\nthat quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral A BCD.\nHere, you can also note that vertex A  corresponds to vertex A, vertex B \ncorresponds to vertex B, vertex C  corresponds to vertex C and vertex  D  corresponds\nto vertex D. Symbolically, these correspondences are represented as A  A, B B,\nC C and D  D. By actually measuring the angles and the sides of the two\nquadrilaterals, you may verify that\n(i)  A =  A,  B =  B,  C =  C,  D =  D and\n(ii)  \nAB BC CD DA\nAB BC CD DA   .\nThis again emphasises that two polygons of the same number of sides are\nsimilar, if (i) all the corresponding angles are equal and (ii) all the corresponding\nsides are in the same ratio (or proportion ).\nFig. 6.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 77\nFrom the above, you can easily say that quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS of\nFig. 6.5 are similar.\nFig. 6.5\nRemark :  You can verify that if one polygon is similar to another polygon and this\nsecond polygon is similar to a third polygon, then the first polygon is similar to the third\npolygon.\nYou may note that in the two quadrilaterals (a square and a rectangle) of\nFig. 6.6, corresponding angles are equal, but their corresponding sides are not in thesame ratio.\nFig. 6.6\nSo, the two quadrilaterals are not similar\n. Similarly, you may note that in the two\nquadrilaterals (a square and a rhombus) of Fig. 6.7, corresponding sides are in the\nsame ratio, but their corresponding angles are not equal. Again, the two polygons\n(quadrilaterals) are not similar .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n78 MATHEMA TICS\nFig. 6.7\nThus, either of the above two conditions (i) and (ii) of similarity of two\npolygons is not sufficient for them to be similar .\nEXERCISE 6.1\n1.Fill in the blanks using the correct word given in brackets :\n(i) All circles are .

(ii) non-similar figures.\n3.State whether the following quadrilaterals are similar or not:\nFig. 6.8\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 79\n6.3 Similarity of Triangles\nWhat can you say about the similarity of two triangles?\nYou may recall that triangle is also a polygon. So, we can state the same conditions\nfor the similarity of two triangles. That is:\nTwo triangles are similiar, if\n(i) their corresponding angles are equal and\n(ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion ).\nNote that if corresponding angles of two\ntriangles are equal, then they are known as\nequiangular triangles. A famous Greek\nmathematician Thales gave an important truth relatingto two equiangular triangles which is as follows:\nThe ratio of any two corresponding sides in\ntwo equiangular triangles is always the same.\nIt is believed that he had used a result called\nthe Basic Proportionality Theorem  (now known as\nthe Thales Theorem ) for the same.\nTo understand the Basic Proportionality\nTheorem, let us perform the following activity:\nActivity 2 :  Draw any angle XAY and on its one\narm AX, mark points (say five points) P , \n Q, D, R and\nB such that AP = PQ = QD = DR = RB.\nNow, through B, draw any line intersecting arm\nAY at C (see Fig. 6.9).\nAlso, through the point D, draw a line parallel\nto BC to intersect AC at E. Do you observe from\nyour constructions that AD 3\nDB 2? Measure AE and\nEC. What about AE\nEC? Observe that AE\nEC is also equal to 3\n2. Thus, you can see that\nin  ABC, DE || BC and AD AE\nDB EC . Is it a coincidence? No, it is due to the following\ntheorem (known as the Basic Proportionality Theorem):Thales\n(640 – 546 B.C.)\nFig. 6.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\n80 MATHEMA TICS\nTheorem 6.1 :  If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the\nother two sides in distinct points, the other two sides are divided in the same\nratio.\nPr\noof :  We are given a triangle ABC in which a line\nparallel to side BC intersects other two sides AB and\nAC at D and E respectively (see Fig. 6.10).\nW\ne need to prove that AD AE\nDB EC .\nLet us join BE and CD and then draw DM  AC and\nEN  AB.\nNow, area of  ADE (= 1\n2 base × height) = 1\n2 AD × EN.\nRecall from Class IX, that area of  ADE is denoted as ar(ADE).\nSo, ar(ADE) =1\n2 AD × EN\nSimilarly, ar(BDE) =1\n2 DB × EN,\nar(ADE) =1\n2 AE × DM and ar(DEC) = 1\n2 EC × DM.\nTherefore,ar(ADE)\nar(BDE) =1AD × ENAD 2\n1 DBDB × EN2 (1)\nandar(ADE)\nar(DEC) =1AE × DMAE 2\n1 ECEC × DM2 (2)\nNote that  BDE and DEC are on the same base DE and between the same parallels\nBC and DE.\nSo, ar(BDE) = ar(DEC) (3)Fig. 6.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 81\nTherefore, from (1), (2) and (3), we have :\nAD\nDB =AE\nEC\nIs the converse of this theorem also true (For the meaning of converse, see\nAppendix 1)? To examine this, let us perform the following activity:\nActivity 3 :   Draw an angle XAY on your\nnotebook and on ray AX, mark points B1, B2,\nB3, B4 and B such that AB1 = B1B2 = B2B3 =\nB3B4 = B4B.\nSimilarly, on ray AY , mark points\nC1, C2, C3, C4 and C such that AC1 = C1C2 =\nC2C3 = C3C4 = C4C. Then join B1C1 and BC\n(see Fig. 6.11).\nNote that1\n1AB\nBB =1\n1AC\nCC(Each equal to 1\n4)\nYou can also see that lines B1C1 and BC are parallel to each other, i.e.,\nB1C1 || BC (1)\nSimilarly, by joining B2C2, B3C3 and B4C4, you can see that:\n2\n2AB\nBB =2\n2AC\nCC 2\n3and B2C2 || BC (2)\n3\n3AB\nBB =3\n3AC\nCC 3\n2and B3C3 || BC (3)\n4\n4AB\nBB =4\n4AC\nCC 4\n1and B4C4 || BC (4)\nFrom (1), (2), (3) and (4), it can be observed that if a line divides two sides of a\ntriangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side.\nYou can repeat this activity by drawing any angle XAY of different measure and\ntaking any  number of equal parts on arms AX and AY . Each time, you will arrive at\nthe same result. Thus, we obtain the following theorem, which is the converse of\nTheorem 6.1:Fig. 6.11\nReprint 2025-26\n\n82 MATHEMA TICS\nFig. 6.13Theorem 6.2 :  If a line divides any two sides of a\ntriangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel\nto the third side.\nThis theorem can be proved by taking a line DE such\nthat AD AE\nDB EC  and assuming that DE is not parallel\nto BC (see Fig. 6.12).\nIf DE is not parallel to BC, draw a line DE \nparallel to BC.\nSo,AD\nDB =AE\nEC\n(Why ?)\nTherefore,AE\nEC =AE\nEC\n(Why ?)\nAdding 1 to both sides of above, you can see that E and E  must coincide.\n(Why ?)\nLet us take some examples to illustrate the use of the above theorems.\nExample 1 :  If a line intersects sides AB and AC of a  ABC at D and E respectively\nand is parallel to BC, prove that AD\nAB = AE\nAC (see Fig. 6.13).\nSolution : DE || BC (Given)\nSo,AD\nDB =AE\nEC(Theorem 6.1)\nor,DB\nAD =EC\nAE\nor,DB1AD =EC1AE\nor,AB\nAD =AC\nAE\nSo,AD\nAB =AE\nACFig. 6.12\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 83\nExample 2 :  ABCD is a trapezium with AB || DC.

Symbolically, we write the similarity of these two triangles as\n‘ ABC ~  DEF’ and read it as ‘triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF’. The\nsymbol ‘~’ stands for ‘is similar to’. Recall that you have used the symbol ‘ ’ for\n‘is congruent to’ in Class IX.\nIt must be noted that as done in the case of congruency of two triangles, thesimilarity of two triangles should also be expressed symbolically, using correctcorrespondence of their vertices. For example, for the triangles ABC and DEF ofFig. 6.22, we cannot write  ABC ~  EDF or  ABC ~  FED. However, we\ncan write  BAC ~  EDF.\nNow a natural question arises : For checking the similarity of two triangles, say\nABC and DEF, should we always look for all the equality relations of their correspondingangles ( A =  D,  B =  E,  C =  F) and all the equality relations of the ratios\nof their corresponding sides \nAB BC CA\nDE EF FD? Let us examine. You may recall that\nin Class IX, you have obtained some criteria for congruency of two triangles involving\nonly three pairs of corresponding parts (or elements) of the two triangles. Here also,let us make an attempt to arrive at certain criteria for similarity of two triangles involvingrelationship between less number of pairs of corresponding parts of the two triangles,instead of all the six pairs of corresponding parts. For this, let us perform the followingactivity:\nActivity 4 :  Draw two line segments BC and EF of two different lengths, say 3 cm\nand 5 cm respectively.  \nThen, at the points B and C respectively, construct angles PBC\nand QCB of some measures, say, 60° and 40°. Also, at the points E and F, construct\nangles REF and SFE of 60° and 40° respectively (see Fig. 6.23).\nFig. 6.23\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 87\nLet rays BP and CQ intersect each other at A and rays ER and FS intersect each\nother at D. In the two triangles ABC and DEF, you can see that\n B =  E,  C =  F and  A =  D. That is, corresponding angles of these two\ntriangles are equal. What can you say about their corresponding sides ? Note that\nBC 30.6.EF 5  What about AB\nDE and CA\nFD? On measuring AB, DE, CA and FD, you\nwill find that AB\nDE and CA\nFD are also equal to 0.6 (or nearly equal to 0.6, if there is some\nerror in the measurement). Thus, AB BC CADE EF FD\n You can repeat this activity by\nconstructing several pairs of triangles having their corresponding angles equal. Every\ntime, you will find that their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).This activity leads us to the following criterion for similarity of two triangles.\nTheorem 6.3 :  If in two triangles, corresponding angles ar e equal, then their\nc \norresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion ) and hence the two\ntriangles are similar.\nThis criterion is referred to as the AAA\n(Angle–Angle–Angle) criterion ofsimilarity of two triangles.\nThis theorem can be proved by taking two\ntriangles ABC and DEF such that A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F\n(see Fig. 6.24)\nCut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ.So,  ABC  DPQ (Why ?)\nThis gives  B =  P=   E and PQ || EF (How?)\nTherefore,\nDP\nPE =DQ\nQF(Why?)\ni.e.,AB\nDE =AC\nDF(Why?)\nSimilarly,AB\nDE = BC\nEFand so AB BC ACDE EF DF\n.\nRemark :  If two angles of a triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another\ntriangle, then by the angle sum property of a triangle their third angles will also be\nequal. Therefore, AAA\n similarity criterion can also be stated as follows:Fig. 6.24\nReprint 2025-26\n\n88 MATHEMA TICS\nIf two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another\ntriangle, then the two triangles are similar.\nThis may be referred to as the AA  similarity criterion for two triangles.\nYou have seen above that if the three angles of one triangle are respectively\nequal to the three angles of another triangle, then their corresponding sides are\nproportional (i.e., in the same ratio). What about the converse of this statement? Is theconverse true? In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional tothe sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal? Let usexamine it through an activity :\nActivity 5 :  Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 6 cm,\nCA = 8 cm, DE = 4.5 cm, EF = 9 cm and FD = 12 cm (see Fig. 6.25).\nFig. 6.25\nSo, you have : \nAB BC CA\nDE EF FD (each equal to 23)\nNow measure  A,  B,  C,  D,  E and  F. You will observe that\n A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F, i.e., the corresponding angles of the two\ntriangles are equal.\nYou can repeat this activity by drawing several such triangles (having their sides\nin the same ratio). Everytime  you shall see that their corresponding angles are equal.\nIt is due to the following criterion of similarity of two triangles:\nTheorem 6.4 :  If in two triangles, sides of one triangle are pr opor tional to\n(i.e., in the same ratio of ) the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding\nangles are equal and hence the two triangles are similiar.\nThis criterion is referred to as the SSS (Side–Side–Side) similarity criterion for\ntwo triangles .\nThis theorem can be proved by taking two triangles ABC and DEF such that\nAB BC CA\nDE EF FD  (< 1) (see Fig. 6.26):\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 89\nFig. 6.26\nCut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ.\nIt can be seen thatDP\nPE = DQ\nQFand PQ || EF (How?)\nSo,  P = E and  Q =  F.\nTherefore,DP\nDE =DQ\nDF = PQ\nEF\nSo,DP\nDE =DQ\nDF = BC\nEF(Why?)\nSo, BC = PQ (Why?)\nThus,  ABC  DPQ (Why ?)\nSo,  A =  D, B =  E and  C =  F (How ?)\nRemark :  You may recall that either of the two conditions namely, (i) corresponding\nangles are equal and (ii) corresponding sides are in the same ratio is not sufficient for\ntwo polygons to be similar. However\n, on the basis of Theorems 6.3 and 6.4, you can\nnow say that in case of similarity of the two triangles, it is not necessary to check boththe conditions as one condition implies the other.\nLet us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in\nClass IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSScongruency criterion.This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable toSAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity.\nActivity 6 :  Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 2 cm,  A = 50°,\nAC = 4 cm, DE = 3 cm,  D = 50° and DF = 6 cm (see Fig.6.27).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n90 MATHEMA TICS\nFig. 6.27\nHere, you may observe that AB\nDE = AC\nDF (each equal to 23) and  A (included\nbetween the sides AB and AC) =  D (included between the sides DE and DF). That\nis, one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and sides including\nthese angles are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). Now let us measure  B,  C,\n E and  F.\nYou will find that  B =  E and  C =  F. That is,  A =  D,  B =  E and\n C =  F. So, by AAA similarity criterion,  ABC ~  DEF. You may repeat this\nactivity by drawing several pairs of such triangles with one angle of a triangle equal toone angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional.Everytime, you will find that the triangles are similar. It is due to the following criterionof similarity of triangles:\nTheorem 6.5 :  If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other\ntriangle and the sides including these angles are pr opor\ntional, then the two\ntriangles are similar.\nThis criterion is referred to as\nthe SAS  (Side–Angle–Side)\nsimilarity criterion for two\ntriangles .\nAs before, this theorem can\nbe proved by taking two trianglesABC and DEF such that\nAB AC\nDE DF  ( 1) and  A =  D\n(see Fig. 6.28). Cut DP = AB, DQ\n= AC and join PQ.Fig. 6.28\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 91\nNow, PQ || EF and  ABC  DPQ (How ?)\nSo,  A =  D, B =  P and  C =  Q\nTherefore,  ABC ~ DEF (Why?)\nWe now take some examples to illustrate the use of these criteria.\nExample 4 :  In Fig. 6.29, if PQ || RS, prove that  POQ ~  SOR.\nFig. 6.29\nSolution : PQ || RS (Given)\nSo,  P = S (Alternate angles)\nand  Q = R\nAlso,  POQ = \nSOR (Vertically opposite angles)\nTherefore,  POQ ~ SOR (AAA similarity criterion)\nExample 5 :  Observe Fig. 6.30 and then find  P.\nFig. 6.30\nSolution :  In  ABC and  PQR,\nReprint 2025-26\n\n92 MATHEMA TICS\nAB 3.8 1,\nRQ 7.6 2BC 6 1\nQP 12 2  and CA 3 3 1\nPR 2 63\nThat is,AB BC CA\nRQ QP PR\nSo,  ABC ~ RQP (SSS similarity)\nTherefore,  C = P (Corresponding angles of similar triangles)\nBut  C = 180° –  A –  B (Angle sum property)\n= 180° – 80° – 60° = 40°\nSo,  P = 40°\nExample 6 :  In Fig. 6.31,\nOA .

OD (Given)\nSo,OA\nOC =OD\nOB(1)\nAlso, we have  AOD = COB (Vertically opposite angles) (2)\nTherefore, from (1) and (2),  AOD ~ COB     (SAS similarity criterion)\nSo,  A =  C and  D =  B\n(Corresponding angles of similar triangles)\nExample 7 :  A girl of height 90 cm is\nwalking  away from the base of a\nlamp-post at a speed of 1.2 m/s. If the lampis 3.6 m above the ground, find the length\nof her shadow after 4 seconds.\nSolution :  Let AB denote the lamp-post\nand CD the girl after walking for 4 seconds\naway from the lamp-post (see Fig. 6.32).\nFrom the figure, you can see that DE is the\nshadow of the girl.

The distance of a point from the y-axis is called its\nx-coordinate , or abscissa . The distance of a point from the x-axis is called its\ny-coordinate , or ordinate . The coordinates of a point on the x-axis are of the form\n(x, 0), and of a point on the y-axis are of the form (0, y).\nHere is a play for you. Draw a set of a pair of perpendicular axes on a graph\npaper . Now plot the following points and join them as directed: Join the point A(4, 8) to\nB(3, 9) to C(3, 8) to D(1, 6) to E(1, 5) to F(3, 3) to G(6, 3) to H(8, 5) to I(8, 6) to\nJ(6, 8) to K(6, 9) to L(5, 8) to A. Then join the points P(3.5, 7), Q (3, 6) and R(4, 6) to\nform a triangle. Also join the points X(5.5, 7), Y(5, 6) and Z(6, 6) to form a triangle.\nNow join S(4, 5), T(4.5, 4) and U(5, 5) to form a triangle. Lastly join S to the points\n(0, 5) and (0, 6) and join U to the points (9, 5) and (9, 6). What picture have you got?\nAlso, you have seen that a linear equation in two variables of the form\nax + by + c = 0, ( a, b are not simultaneously zero), when represented graphically ,\ngives a straight line. Further , in Chapter 2, you have seen the graph of\ny = ax2 + bx + c (\na ¹ 0), is a parabola. In fact, coordinate geometry has been developed\nas an algebraic tool for studying geometry of figures. It helps us to study geometry\nusing algebra, and understand algebra with the help of geometry . Because of this,\ncoordinate geometry is widely applied in various fields such as physics, engineering,\nnavigation, seismology and art!\nIn this chapter , you will learn how to find the distance between the two points\nwhose coordinates are given. You will also study how to find the coordinates of the\npoint which divides a line segment joining two given points in a given ratio.COORDINA TE GEOMETR Y\nReprint 2025-26\n\n100 MATHEMA TICS\n7.2 Distance Formula\nLet us consider the following situation:\nA town B is located 36 km east and 15\nkm north of the town A. How would you find\nthe distance from town A to town B withoutactually measuring it. Let us see. This situationcan be represented graphically as shown in\nFig. 7.1. You may use the Pythagoras Theorem\nto calculate this distance.\nNow, suppose two points lie on the x-axis.\nCan we find the distance between them? Forinstance, consider two points A(4, 0) and B(6, 0)in Fig. 7.2. The points A and B lie on the x-axis.\nFrom the figure you can see that OA = 4\nunits and OB = 6 units.\nTherefore, the distance of B from A, i.e.,\nAB = OB – OA = 6 – 4 = 2 units.\nSo, if two points lie on the x-axis, we can\neasily find the distance between them.\nNow, suppose we take two points lying on\nthe y-axis. Can you find the distance between\nthem. If the points C(0, 3) and D(0, 8) lie on they-axis, similarly we find that CD = 8 – 3 = 5 units\n(see Fig. 7.2).\nNext, can you find the distance of A from C (in Fig. 7.2)? Since OA = 4 units and\nOC = 3 units, the distance of A from C, i.e., AC = \n2234  = 5 units. Similarly, you can\nfind the distance of B from D = BD = 10 units.\nNow, if we consider two points not lying on coordinate axis, can we find the\ndistance between them? Yes! We shall use Pythagoras theorem to do so. Let us see\nan example.\nIn Fig. 7.3, the points P(4, 6) and Q(6, 8) lie in the first quadrant. How do we use\nPythagoras theorem to find the distance between them? Let us draw PR and QSperpendicular to the x-axis from P and Q respectively. Also, draw a perpendicular\nfrom P on QS to meet QS at T. Then the coordinates of R and S are (4, 0) and (6, 0),respectively.  So, RS = 2 units. Also, QS = 8 units and TS = PR = 6 units.Fig. 7.1\nFig. 7.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCOORDINATE  GEOMETRY 101\nTherefore, QT = 2 units and PT = RS = 2 units.\nNow, using the Pythagoras theorem, we\nhave\n PQ2 =P T2 + QT2\n=22 + 22 = 8\nSo, PQ = 22  units\nHow will we find the distance between two\npoints in two different quadrants?\nConsider the points P(6, 4) and Q(–5, –3)\n(see Fig. 7.4). Draw QS perpendicular to the\nx-axis. Also draw a perpendicular PT from the\npoint P on QS (extended) to meet y-axis at the\npoint R.\nFig. 7.4\nThen PT = 11 units and QT = 7 units. (Why?)\nUsing the Pythagoras Theorem to the right triangle PTQ, we get\nPQ = 2211 7  = 170 units.Fig. 7.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n102 MATHEMA TICS\nLet us now find the distance between any two\npoints P( x1, y1) and Q( x2, y2). Draw PR and QS\nperpendicular to the x-axis. A perpendicular from the\npoint P on QS is drawn to meet it at the point\nT (see Fig. 7.5).\nThen, OR = x1, OS = x2. So, RS = x2 – x1 = PT.\nAlso, SQ = y2, ST = PR = y1. So, QT = y2 – y1.\nNow, applying the Pythagoras theorem in  PTQ, we get\nPQ2 =P T2 + QT2\n=(x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2\nTherefore, PQ =  22\n21 21x xy y \nNote that since distance is always non-negative, we take only the positive square\nroot. So, the distance between the points P( x1, y1) and Q( x2, y2) is\nPQ = 22\n21 21–+ –x xy y ,\nwhich is called the distance formula .\nRemarks :1. In particular, the distance of a point P( x, y) from the origin O(0, 0) is given by\nOP = \n22xy .\n2. We can also write, PQ =   22\n12 1 2xx y y  . (Why?)\nExample 1 :  Do the points (3, 2), (–2, –3) and (2, 3) form a triangle? If so, name the\ntype of triangle formed.\nSolution :  Let us apply the distance formula to find the distances PQ, QR and PR,\nwhere P(3, 2), Q(–2, –3) and R(2, 3) are the given points. W e have\nPQ = 22 2 2(3 2) (2 3) 5 5 50    = 7.07 (approx.)\nQR = 22 2 2(–2 – 2) (–3 – 3) (– 4) (– 6) 52    = 7.21 (approx.)\nPR = 22 2 2( 3–2 ) ( 2–3 ) 1 ( 1 ) 2     = 1.41 (approx.)\nSince the sum of any two of these distances is greater than the third distance, therefore,\nthe points P, Q and R form a triangle.Fig. 7.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCOORDINATE  GEOMETRY 103\nAlso, PQ2 + PR2 = QR2, by the converse of Pythagoras theorem, we have  P = 90°.\nTherefore, PQR is a right triangle.\nExample 2 :  Show that the points (1, 7), (4, 2), (–1, –1) and (– 4, 4) are the vertices\nof a square.\nSolution :  Let A(1, 7), B(4, 2), C(–1, –1) and D(– 4, 4) be the given points. One way\nof showing that ABCD is a square is to use the property that all its sides should be\nequal and both its digonals should also be equal. Now\n,\nAB =22(1 – 4) (7 2) 9 25 34  \nBC =22(4 1) (2 1) 25 9 34  \nCD =22(–1 4) (–1 – 4) 9 25 34 \nDA =22(1 4) (7 – 4) 25 9 34   \nAC =22(1 1) (7 1) 4 64 68\nBD =22(4 4) (2 4) 64 4 68   \nSince, AB = BC = CD = DA and AC = BD, all the four sides of the quadrilateral\nABCD are equal and its diagonals AC and BD are also equal. Thereore, ABCD is asquare.\nAlternative Solution :  We find\nthe four sides and one diagonal, say,\nAC as above.  Here A D\n2 + DC2 =\n34 + 34 = 68 = AC2. Therefore, by\nthe converse of Pythagorastheorem,  D = 90°. A quadrilateral\nwith all four sides equal and oneangle 90° is a square. So, ABCDis a square.\nExample 3 :  Fig. 7.6 shows the\narrangement of desks in a\nclassroom.

Therefore, they are seated in a line.\nExample 4 :  Find a relation between x and y such that the point ( x , y) is equidistant\nfrom the points (7, 1) and (3, 5).\nSolution :  Let P( x, y) be equidistant from the points A(7, 1) and B(3, 5).\nWe\n are given that AP = BP . So, AP2 = BP2\ni.e., (x – 7)2 + (y – 1)2 =(x – 3)2 + (y – 5)2\ni.e., x2 – 14 x + 49 + y2 – 2y  + 1 = x2 – 6x + 9 + y2 – 10 y + 25\ni.e., x – y =2\nwhich is the required relation.\nRemark :  Note that the graph of the equation\nx – y = 2 is a line. From your earlier studies,\nyou know that a point which is equidistant\nfrom A  and B lies on the perpendicular\nbisector of \nAB. Therefore, the graph of\nx – y = 2 is the perpendicular bisector of AB\n(see Fig. 7.7).\nExample 5 :  Find a point on the y-axis which\nis equidistant from the points A(6, 5) and\nB(– 4, 3).\nSolution :  We know that a point on the\ny-axis is of the form (0, y). So, let the point\nP(0, y) be equidistant from A\n and B. Then\n(6 – 0)2 + (5 – y)2 = (– 4 – 0)2 + (3 – y)2\ni.e., 36 + 25 + y2 – 10 y = 16 + 9 + y2 – 6y\ni.e.,  4 y =3 6\ni.e., y =9Fig. 7.7\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCOORDINATE  GEOMETRY 105\nFig. 7.8\nSo, the required point is (0, 9).\nLet us check our solution : AP =22(6 – 0) (5 – 9) 36 16 52  \nBP =22(– 4 – 0) (3 – 9) 16 36 52   \nNote : Using the remark above, we see that (0, 9) is the intersection of the y-axis and\nthe perpendicular bisector of AB.\nEXERCISE 7.1\n1.Find the distance between the following pairs of points :\n(i) (2, 3), (4, 1) (ii) (– 5, 7), (– 1, 3) (iii) ( a, b), (– a, – b)\n2.Find the distance between the points (0, 0) and (36, 15).

If P lieson AB, it will divide AB in the ratio 1 : 2(see Fig. 7.9). If we take A as the origin O,and 1 km as one unit on both the axis, thecoordinates of B will be (36, 15). In order toknow the position of the tower, we must knowthe coordinates of P. How do we find thesecoordinates?\nLet the coordinates of P be ( x, y). Draw perpendiculars from P and B to the\nx-axis, meeting it in D and E, respectively. Draw PC perpendicular to BE.

Herbart (1890)\n8.1 Introduction\nYou have already studied about triangles, and in particular, right triangles, in yourearlier classes. Let us take some examples from our surroundings where right trianglescan be imagined to be formed. For instance :\n1. Suppose the students of a school are\nvisiting Qutub Minar. Now, if a student\nis looking at the top of the Minar, a right\ntriangle can be imagined to be made,\nas shown in Fig 8.1. Can the studentfind out the height of the Minar, without\nactually measuring it?\n    2.  Suppose a girl is sitting on the balcony\nof her house located on the bank of ariver.  She is looking down at a flower\npot placed on a stair of a temple situated\nnearby on the other bank of the river.\nA right triangle is imagined to be madein this situation as shown in Fig.8.2. If\nyou know the height at which the\nperson is sitting, can you find the width\nof the river?INTRODUCTION  TO\nTRIGONOMETRY\nFig. 8.1\nFig. 8.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n114 MATHEMA TICS\n3. Suppose a hot air balloon is flying in\nthe air.  A girl happens to spot the\nballoon in the sky and runs to hermother to tell her about it.  Her motherrushes out of the house to look at theballoon.Now when the girl had spottedthe balloon intially it was at point A.When both the mother and daughtercame out to see it, it had alreadytravelled to another point B. Can youfind the altitude of B from the ground?\nIn all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using\nsome mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called‘trigonometry’. The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘tri’(meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact,trigonometry  is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle.\nThe earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Earlyastronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth.Even today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering andPhysical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts.\nIn this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with\nrespect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict\nour discussion to acute angles only. However, these  ratios can be extended to otherangles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0° and90°. We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establishsome identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities.\n8.2 Trigonometric Ratios\nIn Section 8.1, you have seen some right trianglesimagined to be formed in different situations.\nLet us take a right triangle ABC as shown\nin Fig. 8.4.\nHere,  CAB (or, in brief, angle A) is an\nacute angle. Note the position of the side BCwith respect to angle A. It faces  A. We call it\nthe side opposite to angle A. AC is the\nhypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB\nis a part of  A. So, we call it the side\nadjacent to angle A.\nFig. 8.4Fig. 8.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO TRIGONOMETRY 115\nNote that the position of sides change\nwhen you consider angle C in place of A\n(see Fig. 8.5).\nYou have studied the concept of ‘ratio’ in\nyour earlier classes. We now define certain ratiosinvolving the sides of a right triangle, and callthem trigonometric ratios.\nThe trigonometric ratios of the angle A\nin right triangle ABC (see Fig. 8.4) are definedas follows :\nsine of  A = \nside opposite to angle A BC\nhypotenuse AC\ncosine of  A = side adjacent to angle A AB\nhypotenuse AC\ntangent of  A = side opposite to angle A BC\nside adjacent to angle A AB\ncosecant of  A = 1 hypotenuse AC\nsine of A side opposite to angle A BC\n\nsecant of  A = 1 hypotenuse AC\ncosine of A side adjacent to angle A AB\n\ncotangent of  A = 1 side adjacent to angle A AB\ntangent of A side opposite to angle A BC\n\nThe ratios defined above are abbreviated as sin A, cos A, tan A, cosec A, sec A\nand cot A respectively. Note that the ratios cosec A, sec A and cot A are respectively,\nthe reciprocals of the ratios sin A, cos A and tan A.\nAlso, observe that tan A = BC\nBC sin A AC\nAB AB cos A\nAC  and cot A = cosA\nsin A.\nSo, the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle in a right triangle express the\nrelationship between the angle and the length of its sides.\nWhy don’t you try to define the trigonometric ratios for angle C in the right\ntriangle? (See Fig. 8.5)Fig. 8.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\n116 MATHEMA TICS\nThe first use of the idea of ‘sine’ in the way we use\nit today was in the work Aryabhatiyam  by Aryabhata,\nin A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya\nfor the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or\njiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam  was\ntranslated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as\nit is. The word jiva was translated into sinus,  which\nmeans curve, when the Arabic version was translated\ninto Latin. Soon the word sinus , also used as sine,\nbecame common in mathematical texts throughoutEurope. An English Professor of astronomy EdmundGunter (1581–1626), first used the abbreviatednotation ‘sin’.\nThe origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function\narose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhattacalled it kotijya . The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the\nEnglish Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’.\nRemark :  Note that the symbol sin A  is used as an\nabbreviation for ‘the sine of the angle \nA’. sin A is  not\nthe product of ‘sin’ and A. ‘sin’ separated from Ahas no meaning. Similarly, cos A is  not the product of\n‘cos’ and A. Similar interpretations follow for othertrigonometric ratios also.\nNow, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse\nAC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangleABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QNperpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), howwill the trigonometric ratios of  A in  PAM differ\nfrom those of  A in  CAB or from those of  A in\n QAN?\nTo answer this, first look at these triangles. Is  PAM similar to  CAB? From\nChapter 6, recall the AA similarity criterion. Using the criterion, you will see that thetriangles PAM and CAB are similar. Therefore, by the property of similar triangles,the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional.\nSo, we have\nAM\nAB =AP MP\nAC BCAryabhata\n C.E. 476 – 550\nFig. 8.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO TRIGONOMETRY 117\nFrom this, we findMP\nAP =BCsin AAC .\nSimilarly,AM AB\nAP AC  = cos A, MP BCtan AAM AB  and so on.\nThis shows that the trigonometric ratios of angle A in  PAM not differ from\nthose of angle A in  CAB.\nIn the same way, you should check that the value of sin A (and also of other\ntrigonometric ratios) remains the same in  QAN also.\nFrom our observations, it is now clear that the values of the trigonometric\nratios of an angle do not vary with the lengths of the sides of the triangle, if\nthe angle remains the same.\nNote : For the sake of convenience, we may write sin2A, cos2A, etc., in place of\n(sin A)2, (cos A)2, etc., respectively. But cosec A = (sin A)–1  sin–1 A (it is called sine\ninverse A). sin–1 A has a different meaning, which will be discussed in higher classes.\nSimilar conventions hold for the other trigonometric ratios as well. Sometimes, the\nGreek letter  (theta) is also used to denote an angle.\nWe have defined six trigonometric ratios of an acute angle. If we know any one\nof the ratios, can we obtain the other ratios? Let us see.\nIf in a right triangle ABC, sin A = 1,\n3\nthen this means that BC 1\nAC 3, i.e., the\nlengths of the sides BC and AC of the triangleABC are in the ratio 1 : 3 (see Fig. 8.7). So ifBC is equal to k, then AC will be 3 k, where\nk is any positive number. To determine other\ntrigonometric ratios for the angle A, we need to find the length of the third sideAB. Do you remember the Pythagoras theorem? Let us use it to determine therequired length AB.\nAB\n2 =A C2 – BC2 = (3 k)2 – (k)2 = 8k2 = (2 2k)2\nTherefore, AB = 22 k\nSo, we get AB = 22 k(Why is AB not – 22 k?)\nNow, cos A =A B 22 22\nAC 3 3k\nk\nSimilarly, you can obtain the other trigonometric ratios of the angle A.Fig. 8.7\nReprint 2025-26\n\n118 MATHEMA TICS\nRemark :  Since the hypotenuse is the longest side in a right triangle, the value of\nsin A or cos \nA is always less than 1 (or, in particular, equal to 1).\nLet us consider some examples.\nExample 1 :  Given tan A  = 4\n3, find the other\ntrigonometric ratios of the angle A.\nSolution :  Let us first draw a right  ABC\n(see Fig 8.8).\nNow, we know that tan A\n = BC 4\nAB 3.\nTherefore, if BC = 4 k, then AB = 3 k, where k is a\npositive number.\nNow, by using the Pythagoras Theorem, we have\nAC2 =A B2 + BC2 = (4 k)2 + (3 k)2 = 25 k2\nSo, AC = 5 k\nNow, we can write all the trigonometric ratios using their definitions.\nsin A =BC 4 4\nAC 5 5k\nk\ncos A =AB 3 3\nAC 5 5k\nk\nTherefore, cot A = 13 15,cosec A =tan A 4 sin A 4  and sec A = 15\ncos A 3\nExample 2 :  If  B and  Q are\nacute angles such that sin B = sin Q,\nthen prove that  B =  Q.\nSolution :  Let us consider two right\ntriangles ABC and PQR where\nsin B = sin Q\n (see Fig. 8.9).\nWe have sin B =AC\nAB\nand sin Q =PR\nPQFig. 8.8\nFig. 8.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO TRIGONOMETRY 119\nThenAC\nAB =PR\nPQ\nTherefore,AC\nPR =AB,s a yPQk (1)\nNow, using Pythagoras theorem,\nBC =22AB AC\nand QR =22PQ – PR\nSo,BC\nQR = 2 2 22 22 2 2\n2 2 22 22AB AC PQ PR PQ PR\nPQ PR PQ PR PQ PRkk kk  \n (2)\nFrom (1) and (2), we have\nAC\nPR =AB BC\nPQ QR\nThen, by using Theorem 6.4,  ACB ~  PRQ and therefore,  B =  Q.\nExample 3 :  Consider  ACB, right-angled at C, in\nwhich AB = 29 units, BC = 21 units and  ABC \n= \n(see Fig. 8.10).

Consider an equilateral triangle ABC. Sinceeach angle in an equilateral triangle is 60°, therefore, A =  B =  C = 60°.\nDraw the perpendicular AD from A to the side BC(see Fig. 8.15).\nNow  ABD  ACD (Why?)\nTherefore, BD = DC\nand  BAD = CAD (CPCT)\nNow observe that:\n ABD is a right triangle, right- angled at D with  BAD = 30° and  ABD = 60°\n(see Fig. 8.15).Fig. 8.15Fig. 8.14\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO TRIGONOMETRY 123\nAs you know, for finding the trigonometric ratios, we need to know the lengths of the\nsides of the triangle. So, let us suppose that AB = 2 a.\nThen, BD =1BC =2a\nand AD2 = AB2 – BD2 =( 2 a)2 – (a)2 = 3a2,\nTherefore, AD = 3a\nNow, we have :\nsin 30° =BD 1\nAB 2 2a\na , cos 30° = AD 3 3\nAB 2 2a\na\ntan 30° =BD 1\nAD 33a\na .\nAlso, cosec 30° =12,\nsin 30\n  sec 30° = 12\ncos 30 3\n\ncot 30° =13\ntan 30\n.\nSimilarly,\nsin 60° =AD 3 3\nAB 2 2a\na , cos 60° = 1\n2, tan 60° = 3,\ncosec 60° =2,\n3 sec 60° = 2 and cot 60° = 1\n3\nTrigonometric Ratios of 0° and 90°\nLet us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of angle\nA, if it is made smaller and smaller in the right triangle ABC\n(see Fig. 8.16), till it becomes zero. As  A gets smaller and\nsmaller, the length of the side BC decreases.The point C getscloser to point B, and finally when  A becomes very close\nto 0°, AC becomes almost the same as AB (see Fig. 8.17).\nFig. 8.17Fig. 8.16\nReprint 2025-26\n\n124 MATHEMA TICS\nWhen  A is very close to 0°, BC gets very close to 0 and so the value of\nsin A = BC\nAC is very close to 0. Also, when  A is very close to 0°, AC is nearly the\nsame as AB and so the value of cos A = AB\nAC is very close to 1.\nThis helps us to see how we can define the values of sin A and cos A when\nA = 0°. We define : sin 0° = 0 and cos 0° = 1.\nUsing these, we have :\ntan 0° = sin 0°\ncos 0° = 0, cot 0° = 1,\ntan 0° which is not defined. (Why?)\nsec 0° = 1\ncos 0 = 1 and cosec 0° = 1,\nsin 0 which is again not defined.(Why?)\nNow, let us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of  A, when it is made\nlarger and larger in  ABC till it becomes 90°. As  A gets larger and larger,  C gets\nsmaller and smaller. Therefore, as in the case above, the length of the side AB goes on\ndecreasing. The point A gets closer to point B. Finally when  A is very close to 90°,\n C becomes very close to 0° and the side AC almost coincides with side BC\n(see Fig. 8.18).\nFig. 8.18\nWhen  C is very close to 0°,  A is very close to 90°, side AC is nearly the\nsame as side BC, and so sin A is very close to 1. Also when  A is very close to 90°,\n C is very close to 0°, and the side AB is nearly zero, so cos A is very close to 0.\nSo, we define : sin 90° = 1 and cos 90° = 0.\nNow, why don’t you find the other trigonometric ratios of 90°?\nWe shall now give the values of all the trigonometric ratios of 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°\nand 90° in Table 8.1, for ready reference.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO TRIGONOMETRY 125\nTable 8.1\n   A 0° 30° 45° 60° 90°\nsin A 01\n21\n23\n21\ncos A 13\n21\n21\n20\ntan A 01\n31 3 Not defined\ncosec A Not defined 2 22\n31\nsec A 12\n32 2 Not defined\ncot A Not defined 3 11\n30\nRemark :  From the table above you can observe that as  A increases from 0° to\n90°, sin \nA increases from 0 to 1 and cos A decreases from 1 to 0.\nLet us illustrate the use of the values in the table above through some examples.\nExample 6 : In  ABC, right-angled at B,\nAB = 5 cm and  ACB = 30° (see Fig. 8.19).\nDetermine the lengths of the sides BC and \nAC.\nSolution :  To find the length of the side BC, we will\nchoose the trigonometric ratio involving BC and the\ngiven side AB.

Therefore (4) is true for\nall A such that 0° < A  90°.\nUsing these identities, we can express each trigonometric ratio in terms of other\ntrigonometric ratios, i.e., if any one of the ratios is known, we can also determine the\nvalues of other trigonometric ratios.\nLet us see how we can do this using these identities. Suppose we know that\ntan A = 1\n3 Then, cot A = 3.\nSince, sec2 A = 1 + tan2 A = 14, 133  sec A = 2\n3, and cos A = 3\n2\nAgain, sin A = 2 311c o s A 142   .

In this chapter ,\nyou will be studying about some ways in which trigonometry is used in the life around\nyou.\nLet us consider Fig. 8.1 of prvious chapter , which is redrawn below in Fig. 9.1.\nFig. 9.1\nIn this figure, the line AC drawn from the eye of the student to the top of the\nminar is called the line of sight . The student is looking at the top of the minar . The\nangle BAC, so formed by the line of sight with the horizontal, is called the angle of\nelevation of the top of the minar from the eye of the student.\nThus, the line of sight is the line drawn from the eye of an observer to the point\nin the object viewed by the observer . The angle of elevation of the point viewed isSOME APPLICA TIONS  OF\nTRIGONOMETR Y\nReprint 2025-26\n\n134 MATHEMA TICS\nthe angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point being viewed is\nabove the horizontal level, i.e., the case when we raise our head to look at the object\n(see Fig. 9.2).\nFig. 9.2\nNow , consider the situation given in Fig. 8.2. The girl sitting on the balcony is\nlooking down at a flower pot placed on a stair of the temple. In this case, the line of\nsight is below  the horizontal level. The angle so formed by the line of sight with the\nhorizontal is called the angle of depr ession .\nThus, the angle of depression of a point on the object being viewed is the angle\nformed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point is below the horizontal\nlevel, i.e., the case when we lower our head to look at the point being viewed\n(see Fig. 9.3).\nFig. 9.3\nNow , you may identify the lines of sight, and the angles so formed in Fig. 8.3.\nAre they angles of elevation or angles of depression?\nLet us refer to Fig. 9.1 again. If you want to find the height CD of the minar\nwithout actually measuring it, what information do you need? You would need to know\nthe following:\n(i)the distance DE at which the student is standing from the foot of the minar\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSOME APPLICATIONS  OF TRIGONOMETRY 135\n(ii)the angle of elevation,  BAC, of the top of the minar\n(iii) the height AE of the student.\nAssuming that the above three conditions are known, how can we determine the\nheight of the minar?\nIn the figure, CD = CB + BD. Here, BD = AE, which is the height of the student.\nTo find BC, we will use trigonometric ratios of  BAC or  A.\nIn  ABC, the side BC is the opposite side in relation to the known  A. Now,\nwhich of the trigonometric ratios can we use? Which one of them has the two values\nthat we have and the one we need to determine? Our search narrows down to usingeither tan A or cot A, as these ratios involve AB and BC.\nTherefore, tan A = BC\nABor cot A = AB,\nBC which on solving would give us BC.\nBy adding AE to BC, you will get the height of the minar.\nNow let us explain the process, we have just discussed, by solving some problems.\nExample 1 :  A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground,\nwhich is 15 m away from the foot of the tower , the angle of elevation of the top of the\ntower is found to be 60°. Find the height of the tower\n.\nSolution :  First let us draw a simple diagram to\nrepresent the problem (see Fig. 9.4). Here A B\nrepresents the tower\n, CB is the distance of the point\nfrom the tower and  ACB is the angle of elevation.\nWe need to determine the height of the tower, i.e.,\nAB. Also, ACB is a triangle, right-angled at B.\nTo solve the problem, we choose the trigonometric\nratio tan 60° (or cot 60°), as the ratio involves ABand BC.\nNow, tan 60° =AB\nBC\ni.e., 3 =AB\n15\ni.e., AB = 15 3\nHence, the height of the tower is 15 3  m.\nFig. 9.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n136 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 2 :  An electrician has to repair an\nelectric fault on a pole of height 5 m. She needs\nto reach a point 1.3m below the top of the pole\nto undertake the repair work (see Fig. 9.5). Whatshould be the length of the ladder that she should\nuse which, when inclined at an angle of 60° to\nthe horizontal, would enable her to reach therequired position? Also, how far from the foot\nof the pole should she place the foot of the\nladder? (You may take \n3 = 1.73)\nSolution :  In Fig. 9.5, the electrician is required to\nreach the point B on the pole AD.\nSo, BD = \nAD – AB = (5 – 1.3)m = 3.7 m.\nHere, BC represents the ladder. We need to find\nits length, i.e., the hypotenuse of the right triangle BDC.\nNow, can you think which trigonometic ratio should we consider?It should be sin 60°.\nSo,BD\nBC = sin 60° or3.7\nBC = 3\n2\nTherefore, BC =3.7 2\n3 = 4.28 m (approx.)\ni.e., the length of the ladder should be 4.28 m.\nNow,DC\nBD = cot 60° = 1\n3\ni.e., DC =3.7\n3 = 2.14 m (approx.)\nTherefore, she should place the foot of the ladder at a distance of 2.14 m from\nthe pole.\nFig. 9.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSOME APPLICATIONS  OF TRIGONOMETRY 137\nExample 3 :  An observer 1.5 m tall is 28.5 m away\nfrom a chimney. The angle of elevation of the top\nof the chimney from her eyes is 45°. What is the\nheight of the chimney?\nSolution :  Here, AB is the chimney, CD the\nobserver and  ADE the angle of elevation (see\nFig. 9.6). In this case, \nADE is a triangle, right-angled\nat E and we are required to find the height of the\nchimney.\nWe have AB =  AE + BE = AE + 1.5and\n DE =  CB = 28.5 m\nTo determine AE, we choose a trigonometric ratio, which involves both AE and\nDE. Let us choose the tangent of the angle of elevation.\nNow, tan 45° =AE\nDE\ni.e., 1 =AE\n28.5\nTherefore, AE = 28.5\nSo the height of the chimney (AB) = (28.5 + 1.5) m = 30 m.\nExample 4 :  From a point P on the ground the angle of elevation of the top of a 10 m\ntall building is 30°. A  flag is hoisted at the top of the building and the angle of elevation\nof the top of the flagstaff from P is 45°. Find the length of the flagstaff and the\ndistance of the building from the point P\n. (You may take 3 = 1.732)\nSolution :  In Fig. 9.7, AB denotes the height of the building, BD the flagstaff and P\nthe given point. Note that there are two right triangles PAB and P\nAD. We are required\nto find the length of the flagstaff, i.e., DB and the distance of the building from thepoint P, i.e., PA.Fig. 9.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n138 MATHEMA TICS\nSince, we know the height of the building AB, we\nwill first consider the right  PAB.\nWe have tan 30° =AB\nAP\ni.e.,1\n3 =10\nAP\nTherefore, AP = 10 3\ni.e., the distance of the building from P is 10 3  m = 17.32 m.\nNext, let us suppose DB = x m. Then AD = (10 + x) m.\nNow, in right  PAD, tan 45° =AD 10\nAP 10 3x\nTherefore, 1 =10\n10 3x\ni.e., x = 10 31 = 7.32\nSo, the length of the flagstaff is 7.32 m.\nExample 5 :  The shadow of a tower standing\non a level ground is found to be 40 m longer\nwhen the Sun’s altitude is 30° than when it is\n60°. Find the height of the tower .\nSolution :  In Fig. 9.8, AB is the tower and\nBC is the length of the shadow when theSun’ s altitude is 60°, i.e., the angle of\nelevation of the top of the tower from the tipof the shadow is 60° and DB is the length ofthe shadow\n, when the angle of elevation\nis 30°.\nNow, let AB be h m and BC be x m. According to the question, DB is 40 m longer\nthan BC.\nFig. 9.7\nFig. 9.8\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSOME APPLICATIONS  OF TRIGONOMETRY 139\nSo, DB = (40 + x) m\nNow, we have two right triangles ABC and ABD.\nIn  ABC, tan 60° =AB\nBC\nor, 3 =h\nx(1)\nIn  ABD, tan 30° =AB\nBD\ni.e.,1\n3 =40h\nx(2)\nFrom (1), we have h = 3x\nPutting this value in (2), we get 33x  = x + 40, i.e., 3 x = x + 40\ni.e., x =2 0\nSo, h =20 3 [From (1)]\nTherefore, the height of the tower is 20 3 m.\nExample 6 :  The angles of depression of the top and the bottom of an 8 m tall building\nfrom the top of a multi-storeyed building are 30°\nand 45°, respectively. Find the height of the multi-\nstoreyed building and the distance between thetwo buildings.\nSolution :  In Fig. 9.9, PC denotes the multi-\nstoryed building and AB denotes the 8 m tall\nbuilding. W\ne are interested to determine the height\nof the multi-storeyed building, i.e., PC and the\ndistance between the two buildings, i.e., AC.Look at the figure carefully. Observe that PB isa transversal to the parallel lines PQ and BD.Therefore, QPB and PBD are alternate\nangles, and so are equal.So PBD = 30°. Similarly,   PAC = 45°.\nIn right  PBD, we have\nFig. 9.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\n140 MATHEMA TICS\nPD\nBD = tan 30° = 1\n3or BD = PD 3\nIn right  PAC, we have\nPC\nAC = tan 45° = 1\ni.e., PC = AC\nAlso, PC = PD + DC, therefore, PD + DC = AC.\nSince, AC = BD and DC = AB = 8 m, we get PD + 8 = BD = PD 3  (Why?)\nThis gives PD =\n83 18431 m .\n31 31 31\n \n \nSo, the height of the multi-storeyed building is   431 8 m = 4 3 + 3 m\nand the distance between the two buildings is also 43 3m .\nExample 7 :  From a point on a bridge across a river, the angles of depression of\nthe banks on opposite sides of the river are 30° and 45°, respectively. If the bridge\nis at a height of 3 m from the banks, find the width of the river\n.\nSolution : In Fig 9.10, A and B\nrepresent points on the bank on\nopposite sides of the river, so thatAB is the width of the river . P\n is a\npoint on the bridge at a height of 3m, i.e., DP = 3 m. We areinterested to determine the widthof the river, which is the length ofthe side AB of the D APB.\nNow, AB = AD + DBIn right   APD,  A = 30°.\nSo, tan 30° =\nPD\nAD\nFig. 9.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSOME APPLICATIONS  OF TRIGONOMETRY 141\ni.e.,1\n3 =3\nADor AD = 33  m\nAlso, in right  PBD,  B = 45°.

Y ou also studied the natur e, position and r elative size of\nimages formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of\nthe human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects\naround us. It has a lens in its structure.  What is the function of the lens\nin a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of\nvision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter .\nWe have lear nt in the pr evious chapter about light and some of its\nproperties. In this chapter , we shall use these ideas to study some of the\noptical phenomena in natur e. We shall also discuss about rainbow\nformation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.\n10.1 THE HUMAN EYE\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.\nIt enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however , impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us.\nThe h\numan eye is like a camera.  Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea.\nIt forms the transparent bulge on the front\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1.\nThe eyeball is approximately spherical in shape\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the\nrefraction for the light rays entering the eye\noccurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The\ncrystalline lens merely provides the finer\nadjustment of focal length required to focus\nobjects at dif ferent distances on the r etina. W e find a structur e called iris\nbehind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the\nsize of the pupil.  The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light\nFigure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1\nThe human eye\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 162entering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object\non the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells.  The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals.  These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves.  The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are.\n10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases.  This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincreases the curvatur e of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker .\nConsequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases.  This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly.\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation.  However , the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit.  T ry to r ead a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes. Y ou may see the image being blurr ed\nor feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you\nmust hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes.  The minimum distance, at\nwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the\nleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.\nFor a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a nor mal eye. Y ou may note\nhere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and\ninfinity.\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and\ncloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete\nloss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\nSometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.\nIn such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and\ncomfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects\nof the eye.\nThere are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These\nare (i) myopia or near -sightedness, (ii) Hyper metr opia or far -\nsightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia.  These defects can be corrected by\nthe use of suitable spherical lenses. W e discuss below these defects\nand their correction.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 163(a)Myopia\nMyopia is also known as near -\nsightedness. A person with myopia\ncan see nearby objects clearly but\ncannot see distant objects distinctly.\nA person with this defect has the far\npoint nearer than infinity. Such a\nperson may see clearly upto a\ndistance of a few metres. In a myopic\neye, the image of a distant object is\nformed in front of the retina [Fig.\n10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself.\nThis defect may arise due to (i)\nexcessive curvature of the eye lens,\nor (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This\ndefect can be corrected by using a\nconcave lens of suitable power . This\nis illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A\nconcave lens of suitable power will\nbring the image back on to the\nretina and thus the defect is corrected.\n(b)Hypermetropia\nHyper metropia is also known as far -sightedness.\nA person with hypermetropia can see distant\nobjects clearly but cannot see nearby objects\ndistinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther\naway from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a\nperson has to keep a reading material much\nbeyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable\nreading. This is because the light rays from a\ncloseby object are focussed at a point behind the\nretina as shown in Fig. 10.3 (b). This defect arises\neither because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is\ntoo long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small.\nThis defect can be corrected by using a convex\nlens of appropriate power . This is illustrated in\nFig. 10.3 (c). Eye-glasses with converging lenses\nprovide the additional focussing power required\nfor forming the image on the retina.\n(c)   Presbyopia\nThe power of accommodation of the eye usually\ndecreases with ageing. For most people, the near\npoint gradually recedes away. They find it difficult\nto see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly\nwithout corrective eye-glasses.  This defect is\ncalled Presbyopia.  It arises due to the gradualFigure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2\n(a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction for myopia with a\nconcave lens\nFigure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3\n(a), (b) The hypermetropic eye, and (c)\ncorrection for hypermetropia\nN = Near point of a\n      hypermetropic eye.\nN’ = Near point of a\n      normal eye.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 164Think it over\nYou talk of wondr ous things you see,\nYou say the sun shines bright;\nI feel him warm, but how can he\nOr make it day or night ?\n – C. CIBBER\nDo you know that our eyes can live even after our death? By donating our eyes after we\ndie, we can light the life of a blind person.\nAbout 35 million people in the developing world are blind and most of them can be\ncured. About 4.5 million people with corneal blindness can be cured through corneal\ntransplantation of donated eyes. Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children below the\nage of 12. So, if we have got the gift of vision, why not pass it on to somebody who does\nnot have it? What do we have to keep in mind when eyes have to be donated?\n/square6Eye donors can belong to any age group or sex. People who use spectacles, or those\noperated for cataract, can still donate the eyes. People who are diabetic, have\nhypertension, asthma patients and those without communicable diseases can also\ndonate eyes.weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the\neye lens.  Sometimes, a person may suffer from both myopia and\nhypermetropia.  Such people often require bi-focal lenses. A common\ntype of bi-focal lenses consists of both concave and convex lenses.\nThe upper portion consists of a concave lens. It facilitates distant\nvision. The lower part is a convex lens.  It facilitates near vision.\n  These days, it is possible to correct the refractive defects with\ncontact lenses or through surgical interventions.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What is meant by power of accommodation of the eye?\n2.

For parallel refracting surfaces, as in a glass slab, the emergent ray\nis parallel to the incident ray.  However , it is slightly displaced laterally.\nHow would light get refracted through a transparent prism? Consider a\ntriangular glass prism. It has two triangular bases and three rectangular\nlateral sur faces. These sur faces ar\ne inclined to each other . The angle\nbetween its two lateral faces is called the angle of the prism.

It is a simple process and does not lead to\nany disfigurement.\n/square6Persons who were infected with or died because of AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, rabies,\nacute leukaemia, tetanus, cholera, meningitis or encephalitis cannot donate eyes.\nAn eye bank collects, evaluates and distributes the donated eyes. All eyes donated are\nevaluated using strict medical standards. Those donated eyes found unsuitable for\ntransplantation are used for valuable research and medical education. The identities\nof both the donor and the recipient remain confidential.\nOne pair of eyes gives vision to up to FOUR CORNEAL BLIND PEOPLE.\nActivity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1\n/square6Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\n/square6Place a glass prism on it in such a way that it rests on its triangular\nbase.

Y ou will find a beautiful band of colours.\nWhy does this happen?Here PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted ray and FS is the\nemergent ray. Y ou may note that a ray of light is entering from air to\nglass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards\nthe normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from\nglass to air . Hence it has bent away fr om nor mal. Compar e the angle of\nincidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the\nprism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?\nThe peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an\nangle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of\ndeviation. In this case ∠D is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle of\ndeviation in the above activity and measure it.\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL ASS PRISM\nASS PRISMASS PRISM ASS PRISMASS PRISM\nYou must have seen and appr eciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow.\nHow could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the\nrainbow? Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to the\nrefraction of light through a prism. The inclined refracting surfaces of a\nglass prism show exciting phenomenon.  Let us find it out through an\nactivity.PE – Incident ray ∠i – Angle of incidence\nEF – Refracted ray ∠r – Angle of refraction\nFS – Emergent ray ∠e – Angle of emergence\n∠A – Angle of the prism ∠D – Angle of deviation\nFigure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4  Refraction of light through a triangular glass prism\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 167The prism has probably split the incident\nwhite light into a band of colours.  Note the\ncolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The various\ncolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,\nYellow, Orange and Red, as shown in\nFig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.\nThe band of the coloured components of a\nlight beam is called its spectrum. Y ou might\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\nYet something makes each colour distinct fr om the other . The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However , he could not get any mor e colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism. This observation\ngave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven\ncolours.\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of\nsunlight is often referred to as white light.\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky\nafter a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion\nof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the\natmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction\nopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like\nsmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incident\nsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it\nagain when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due\nto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different\ncolours reach the observer’s eye.\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when\nyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water\nfountain, with the Sun behind you.Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\nFigure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of\nwhite light\nFigure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky\nFigure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Rainbow formationSunlightRaindrop\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 168Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10\nAtmospheric refraction\neffects at sunrise and\nsunset10.5     ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION\nYou might have observed the appar ent random wavering or\nflickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air\nrising above a fir e or a radiator . The air just above the fir e becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air . Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen thr ough the hot air , fluctuates.\nThis wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.\nTwinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further , this appar\nent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers – the\nstar sometimes appears brighter , and at some other time, fainter , which\nis the twinkling effect.\nWhy don’t the planets twinkle? The p lanets are much\ncloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.\nIf we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\nof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\npoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.\nAdvance sunrise and delayed sunset\nThe Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual\nsunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset\nbecause of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we\nmean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.\n10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the\nSun with respect to the horizon. The time difference\nbetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about\n2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon .Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9\nApparent star position\ndue to atmospheric\nrefraction\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 16910.6  SC ATTERING OF LIGHT\nThe interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several\nspectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.\nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.\nHowever , its path becomes visible thr ough a colloidal solution wher e the\nsize of the particles is r elatively lar ger.\n10.6.1 T yndall Effect\nThe earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.\nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air . When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.\nThus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest.  Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. V ery fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.  If the size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite.\n10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.  The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not\nprominent at such heights.\nYou might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights ar e red in colour .\nDo you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke.  Therefore,\nit can be seen in the same colour at a distance.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 170What y ou hav e learnt\n/square6The ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its\nfocal length, is called the accommodation of the eye.\n/square6The smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is\ncalled the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision.  For a young\nadult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm.\n/square6The common refractive defects of vision include myopia, hypermetropia and\npresbyopia. Myopia (short-sightedness – the image of distant objects is focussed\nbefor e the r etina) is corr ected by using a concave lens of suitable power .\nHyper metropia (far -sightedness – the image of nearby objects is focussed beyond\nthe retina) is corrected by using a convex lens of suitable power . The eye loses its\npower of accommodation at old age.\n/square6The splitting of white light into its component colours is called dispersion.\n/square6Scattering of light causes the blue colour of sky.\nEXERCISES\n1.The human eye can focus on objects at different distances by adjusting the focal\nlength of the eye lens.

It is a controllable\nand convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,\nhospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does\nit flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate\nthe curr ent thr ough an electric cir cuit? In this Chapter , we shall attempt\nto answer such questions. W e shall also discuss the heating ef fect of\nelectric current and its applications.\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\nWe are familiar with air curr ent and water curr ent. W e know that flowing\nwater constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge\nflows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we\nsay that ther e is an electric curr ent in the conductor . In a tor ch, we\nknow that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide\nflow of char ges or an electric curr ent thr ough the tor ch bulb to glow. W e\nhave also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What\ndoes a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and\nthe bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an\nelectric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the\ntorch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by\nthe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In\nother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\nmetallic wir es, electr ons constitute the flow of char ges. However , electr ons\nwere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive\ncharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the\ndirection of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the\ndirection of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the\nflow of electrons, which are negative charges.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 172If a net charge Q, flows across any cross-section of a conductor in\ntime t , then the current I,  through the cross-section is\nIQ\nt= (11.1)\nThe SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent to\nthe char ge contained in nearly 6 × 1018 electr ons. (W e know that an\nelectron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 × 10–19 C.) The electric\ncurrent is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the\nFrench scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836). One ampere is\nconstituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is,\n1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere\n(1 mA = 10–3 A) or in microampere (1 µA = 10–6 A).\nAn instrument called ammeter measures electric\ncurrent in a circuit. It is always connected in series\nin a circuit through which the current is to be\nmeasured. Figure 11.1 shows the schematic\ndiagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a\ncell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key.\nNote that the electric current flows in the circuit\nfrom the positive ter minal of the cell to the negative\nterminal of the cell thr ough the bulb and ammeter .\nFigure 11.1Figure 11.1Figure 11.1Figure 11.1Figure 11.1\nA schematic diagram of an electric circuit\ncomprising – cell, electric bulb, ammeter and\nplug key\nQUESTIONS\n?Example 11.1\nA current of 0.5 A is drawn by a filament of an electric bulb for 10\nminutes. Find the amount of electric charge that flows through the\ncircuit.\nSolution\nWe are given, I = 0.5 A; t = 10 min = 600 s.\nFrom Eq. (11.1), we have\nQ=It\n=0.5 A × 600 s\n=300 C\n1.

Let us consider the analogy of\nflow of water . Char ges do not flow in a copper wir e by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential differenc e –\nalong the conductor . This dif ference of potential may be pr oduced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.\nWe define the electric potential dif ference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other –\nPotential dif ference ( V) between two points = Work done ( W)/Char ge (Q)\nV=W/Q (11.2)\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandr o Volta (174 5–1827), an Italian physicist. \nOne volt is the\npotential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor\nwhen 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one\npoint to the other .\nTherefore, 1 volt =  1 joule\n1 coulomb\n(11.3)\n1 V  = 1 J C–1\nThe potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called\nthe voltmeter . The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the\npoints between which the potential difference is to be measured.\nExample 11.2\nHow much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points\nhaving a potential difference 12 V?\nSolution\nThe amount of charge Q,  that flows between two points at potential\ndifference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W,  done in\nmoving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 174W= VQ\n= 12 V × 2 C\n= 24 J.\nQUESTIONS\n?\n11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM\nWe know that an electric cir cuit, as shown in Fig. 11.1, comprises a cell\n(or a battery), a plug key, electrical component(s), and connecting wires.\nIt is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which different\ncomponents of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently\nused.

A\nstraight line plot shows that as the\ncurrent through a wire increases, the\npotential difference across the wire\nincreases linearly  – this is Ohm’s law.\nActivity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2\n/square6Take a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 – 5 A range), a plug\nkey and some connecting wires.\n/square6Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter\nleaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.4.In this Activity, you will find that approximately the\nsame value for V/I  is obtained in each case. Thus the V–I\ngraph is a straight line that passes through the origin of\nthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constant\nratio.\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm\n(1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference\nacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the\nends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its\ntemperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In\nother words –\nV ∝ I (11.4)\nor V/I =constant\n=R\nor V =IR (11.5)\nIn Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges\n  through it. Its SI\nunit is ohm, r epresented by the Gr eek letter Ω. Accor ding to Ohm’s law,\nR = V/I (11.6)\nIf the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V\nand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor\nis 1 Ω. That is, 1 ohm = 1 volt\n1 ampere\nAlso from Eq. (11.5) we get\nI = V/R (11.7)\nIt is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is\ninversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the\ncurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable\nresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to\nchange the resistance in the cir cuit. W e will now study about electrical\nresistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 177In this Activity we observe that the current is different for different\ncomponents. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path\nfor the flow of electric curr ent while the others r esist the flow. W e know\nthat motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric\ncurrent. The electr ons, however , are not completely fr ee to move within a\nconductor . They ar e restrained by the attraction of the atoms among\nwhich they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is\nretarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low\nresistance is a good conductor . A conductor having some appreciable\nresistance is called a r esistor . A component of identical size that of fers a\nhigher r esistance is a poor conductor . An insulator of the same size of fers\neven higher resistance.\n11.5 FA 11.5 FA11.5 FA11.5 FA11.5 FA CTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST ANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF A\nCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSFigure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4\n/square6Complete the cir cuit by connecting the nichr ome wir e in the gap XY .

The ammeter reading is increased when\na thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the\ncircuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different\nmaterial of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.\nOn applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (11.5) – (11.7)], we observe that the\nresistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of\ncross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements\nhave shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly\nproportional to its length (l ) and inversely proportional to the area of\ncross-section ( A). That is,\nR ∝ l (11.8)\nand R ∝ 1/A (11.9)\nCombining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we get\nR ∝ l\nA\nor, R = ρl\nA(11.10)\nwhere ρ (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical\nresistivity of the material of the conductor . The SI unit of resistivity is\nΩ m. It is a characteristic property of the material.

They are\ngood conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have\nresistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 Ω m. Both the resistance and\nresistivity of a material vary with temperature.\nTable 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher\nthan that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily\nat high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in\nelectrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used\nalmost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and\naluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.\nTable 11.2  Electrical resistivity*  of some substances at 20°C\nMaterial Resistivity ( Ω ΩΩΩΩ m)\nConductors Silver 1.60 × 10–8\nCopper 1.62 × 10–8\nAluminium 2.63 × 10–8\nTungsten 5.20 × 10–8\nNickel 6.84 × 10–8\nIron 10.0 × 10–8\nChromium 12.9 × 10–8\nMercury 94.0 × 10–8\nManganese 1.84 × 10–6\nAlloys Constantan 49 × 10–6\n(alloy of Cu and Ni)\nManganin 44 × 10–6\n(alloy of Cu, Mn and Ni)\nNichrome 100 × 10–6\n(alloy of Ni, Cr\n, Mn and Fe)\nInsulators Glass 1010 – 1014\nHard rubber 1013 – 1016\nEbonite 1015 – 1017\nDiamond 1012 - 1013\nPaper (dry) 1012\n* You need not memorise these values.

What would be their equivalent\nresistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the following\nactivities.Figure 11.7 shows a combination of resistors in which three resistors\nare connected together between points X and Y . Here, the r esistors are\nsaid to be connected in parallel.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 183Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5\n/square6In Activity 11.4, insert a voltmeter across the ends X and Y of the\nseries combination of three resistors, as shown in Fig. 11.6.\n/square6Plug the key in the circuit and note the voltmeter reading. It\ngives the potential difference across the series combination of\nresistors. Let it be V. Now measur e the potential dif ference acr oss\nthe two terminals of the battery. Compare the two values.\n/square6Take out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter . Now insert\nthe voltmeter acr oss the ends X and P of the first r esistor , as\nshown in Fig. 11.8.\nFigure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8\n/square6Plug the key and measure the potential difference across the first\nresistor . Let it be V1.\n/square6Similarly, measure the potential difference across the other two\nresistors, separately. Let these values be V2 and V3, respectively.\n/square6Deduce a relationship between V, V1, V2 and V3.\nYou will observe that the potential dif ference V is equal to the sum of\npotential differences V1, V2, and V3. That is the total potential difference\nacross a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential\ndifference across the individual resistors. That is,\nV = V1 + V2  + V3(11.11)\nIn the electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.8, let I be the current through\nthe circuit. The current through each resistor is also I . It is possible to\nreplace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor\nof resistance R, such that the potential difference \nV across it, and the\ncurrent I through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm’s law\nto the entire circuit, we have\nV = I R (11.12)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 184On applying Ohm’s law to the three resistors separately, we further\nhave\nV1=I R1[11.13(a)]\nV2=I R2[11.13(b)]\nand V3=I R3[11.13(c)]\nFrom Eq. (11.11),\nI R= I R1 + I R2 + I R3\nor\nRs= R1 +R2 + R3(11.14)\nWe can conclude that when several r esistors ar e joined in series, the\nresistance of the combination Rs equals the sum of their individual\nresistances, R1, R2, R3, and is thus greater than any individual resistance.\nExample 11.7\nAn electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 Ω, and a conductor of 4 Ω\nresistance are connected to a 6 V battery (Fig. 11.9). Calculate (a) the\ntotal resistance of the circuit, (b) the current through the circuit, and (c)\nthe potential dif ference acr oss the electric lamp and conductor .\nSolution\nThe resistance of electric lamp, R1 = 20 Ω ,\nThe r esistance of the conductor connected in series, R2 = 4 Ω.\nThen the total resistance in the circuit\nR= R1 + R2\nRs=20 Ω + 4 Ω\n = 24 Ω.\nThe total potential difference across the two terminals of the battery\nV = 6 V .\nNow by Ohm’s law, the current through the circuit is given by\nI=V/Rs\n=6 V/24 Ω\n=0.25 A.Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9  An electric lamp connected in series with\na resistor of 4 Ω to a 6 V battery\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 185Applying Ohm’s law to the electric lamp and conductor separately,\nwe get potential difference across the electric lamp,\nV1=20 Ω × 0.25 A\n=5 V;\nand,\nthat acr oss the conductor , V2  =  4 Ω × 0.25 A\n         =  1 V .\nSuppose that we like to replace the series combination of electric\nlamp and conductor by a single and equivalent r esistor . Its resistance\nmust be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery\nterminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance\nR of this equivalent resistor would be\nR=V/I\n=6 V/ 0.25 A\n=24 Ω.\nThis is the total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sum\nof the two resistances.\nQUESTIONS\n?1.

Connect it with a battery, a\nplug key and an ammeter , as shown in\nFig. 11.10. Also connect a voltmeter in\nparallel with the combination of resistors.\n/square6Plug the key and note the ammeter reading.\nLet the current be I. Also take the voltmeter\nreading. It gives the potential difference V,\nacross the combination. The potential\ndifference acr oss each r esistor is also V. This\ncan be checked by connecting the voltmeter\nacross each individual resistor (see\nFig. 11.11).Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 186/square6Take out the plug from the key. Remove the ammeter and voltmeter from the circuit.\nInsert the ammeter in series with the resistor R1, as shown in Fig. 11.11. Note the ammeter\nreading, I1.\nFigure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11\n/square6Similarly, measure the currents through R2 and R3. Let these be I2 and I3, respectively.\nWhat is the relationship between I, I1, I2 and I3?\nIt is observed that the total current I , is equal to the sum of the\nseparate currents through each branch of the combination.\nI = I1 + I2 + I3(11.15)\nLet Rp be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of\nresistors. By applying Ohm’s law to the parallel combination of resistors,\nwe have\nI = V/Rp(11.16)\nOn applying Ohm’s law to each resistor , we have\nI1 = V /R1;    I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3(11.17)\nFrom Eqs. (11.15) to (11.17), we have\n  V/Rp = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3\nor\n  1/Rp = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3(11.18)\nThus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance\nof a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the\nreciprocals of the individual resistances.\nExample 11.8\nIn the circuit diagram given in Fig. 11.10, suppose the resistors R1,\nR2 and R3 have the values 5 Ω, 10 Ω, 30 Ω, respectively, which have\nbeen connected to a battery of 12 V . Calculate (a) the curr ent thr ough\neach r esistor , (b) the total curr ent in the cir cuit, and (c) the total cir cuit\nresistance.\nSolution\nR1 = 5 Ω, R2 = 10 Ω, and R3 = 30 Ω.\nPotential dif ference acr oss the battery, V = 12 V .\nThis is also the potential difference across each of the individual\nresistor; therefore, to calculate the current in the resistors, we use\nOhm’s law.\nThe current  I1, through R1 = V/ R1\nI1=12 V/5 \nΩ  = 2.4 A.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 187The current  I2, through R2=V/ R2\nI2=12 V/10 Ω=1.2 A.\nThe current  I3, through R3=V/R3\nI3=12 V/30 Ω=0.4 A.\nThe total current in the circuit,\nI= I1 + I2 + I3\n=(2.4 + 1.2 + 0.4) A\n=4 A\nThe total resistance Rp, is given by [Eq. (11.18)]\n1 1 1 1 1\n5 10 30 3pR= + + =\nThus, Rp = 3 Ω.\nExample 11.9\nIf in Fig. 11.12, R1 = 10 Ω, R2 = 40 Ω, R3 = 30 Ω, R4 = 20 Ω, R5 = 60 Ω,\nand a 12 V battery is connected to the arrangement. Calculate\n(a) the total resistance in the circuit, and (b) the total current flowing\nin the circuit.\nSolution\nSuppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by an\nequivalent resistor of resistance, R ′. Similarly we replace\nthe parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single\nresistor of resistance R″. Then using Eq. (11.18), we have\n1/ R′ = 1/10 + 1/40 =5/40; that is R′  = 8 Ω .\nSimilarly, 1/ R″=1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60;\nthat is, R″  = 10 Ω.\nThus, the total resistance, R  = R′ + R″ = 18 Ω.\nTo calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get\n I = V/R = 12 V/18 Ω = 0.67 A.\nWe have seen that in a series cir cuit the curr ent is constant\nthroughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to\nconnect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they\nneed currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example\n11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one\ncomponent fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.\nIf you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on\nmarriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending\nlot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has\nto be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel\ncircuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total\nresistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is\nhelpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and\nrequires different current to operate properly.Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12\nAn electric circuit showing\nthe combination of series\nand parallel resistors\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 18811.7 HEA 11.7 HEA11.7 HEA 11.7 HEA11.7 HEA TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT\nWe know that a battery or a cell is a sour ce of electrical ener gy. The\nchemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between\nits two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current\nthrough a r esistor or a system of r esistors connected to the battery. W e\nhave also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source\nhas to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of\nthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into\nuseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the\nsource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of\ngadget. W e often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating\neffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater , electric ir on etc.\nConsider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance \nR. Let\nthe potential difference across it be  V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply\nenergy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the\nsource is\nP V VI =Q\nt= (11.19)\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t  is P × t,\nthat is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This\nenergy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady\ncurrent  I, the amount of heat \nH produced in time t is\nH = VIt (11.20)QUESTIONS\n?1. Judge the equivalent resistance when the following are connected in\nparallel – (a) 1 Ω and 106 Ω, (b) 1 Ω and 103 Ω, and 106 Ω.\n2. An electric lamp of 100 Ω, a toaster of resistance 50 Ω, and a water\nfilter of resistance 500 Ω are connected in parallel to a 220 V source.\nWhat is the resistance of an electric iron connected to the same source\nthat takes as much current as all three appliances, and what is the\ncurrent through it?\n3. What are the advantages of connecting electrical devices in parallel\nwith the battery instead of connecting them in series?\n4. How can three resistors of resistances 2 Ω, 3 Ω, and 6 Ω be connected\nto give a total resistance of (a) 4 Ω, (b) 1 Ω?\n5. What is (a) the highest, (b) the lowest total resistance that can be secured\nby combinations of four coils of resistance 4 Ω, 8 Ω, 12 Ω, 24 Ω?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 189Applying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get\nH = I2 Rt (11.21)\nThis is known as Joule’s law of heating. The\nlaw implies that heat produced in a resistor is\n(i) directly proportional to the square of current\nfor a given  resistance, (ii) directly proportional to\nresistance for a given current, and (iii) directly\nproportional to the time for which the current flows\nthrough the r esistor . In practical situations, when\nan electric appliance is connected to a known\nvoltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after\ncalculating the current through it, using the\nrelation I = V/R .\nExample 11.10\nAn electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is\nat the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum.\nThe voltage is 220 V . What ar e the curr ent and the r esistance in each\ncase?\nSolution\nFrom Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is\nP = V I\nThus the current I = P/V\n(a)When heating is at the maximum rate,\nI = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω.\n(b)When heating is at the minimum rate,\nI = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 Ω.\nExample 11.11\n100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Ω  resistance.

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.\nHowever , heating ef fect of electric curr ent has many useful applications.\nThe electric laundry ir on, electric toaster , electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating.\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.\nAnother common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used  in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper , iron, lead\netc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A\nfuse must be used.QUESTIONS\n?1. Why does the cord of an electric heater not glow while the heating element\ndoes?\n2.

Thus,\n       1 W  =  1 volt × 1 ampere = 1 V A (11.23)\nThe unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a\nmuch larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical\nenergy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,\ntherefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when\n1 watt of power is used for 1 hour .

Why do the iron filings arrange in such a pattern? What does\nthis pattern demonstrate?  The magnet exerts its influence in the region\nsurrounding it.  Therefore the iron filings experience a force.  The force\nthus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region\nsurrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,\nis said to have a magnetic field.  The lines along which the iron filings\nalign themselves represent magnetic field lines.\nAre there other ways of obtaining magnetic field lines around a bar\nmagnet?

How does\nit behave? The south pole of the needle points towards the north\npole of the magnet. The north pole of the compass is directed\naway from the north pole of the magnet.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 197Magnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.\nThe direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a\nnorth pole of the compass needle moves inside it.  Therefore it is taken\nby convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at\nthe south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4).\nInside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its\nnorth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves.\nThe relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of\ncloseness of the field lines. The field is str onger , that is, the for ce acting\non the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are\ncrowded (see Fig. 12.4).\nNo two field-lines ar e found to cr oss each other . If they did, it would\nmean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point\ntowards two directions, which is not possible.\n12.2 12.212.212.212.2 MA\nMAMA MAMAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT - -- --CCC CCARRYING ARRYINGARRYING ARRYINGARRYING\nCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTOR\nIn Activity 12.1, we have seen that an electric current through a\nmetallic conductor produces a magnetic field around it.

Does the pattern depend on the shape of the\nconductor? W e shall investigate this with an activity.\nWe shall first consider the patter n of the magnetic field ar ound a\nstraight conductor carrying current.Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4\n/square6Take a long straight copper wire, two or three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key. Connect\nall of them in series as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a).\n/square6Place the straight wire parallel to and over a compass needle.\n/square6Plug the key in the circuit.\n/square6Observe the direction of deflection of the north pole of the needle. If the current flows from\nnorth to south, as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a), the north pole of the compass needle would move\ntowards the east.\n/square6Replace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig. 12.5 (b). This would result in\nthe change of the direction of current through the copper wire, that is, from south to\nnorth.\n/square6Observe the change in the dir ection of deflection of the needle. Y ou will see that now the\nneedle moves in opposite direction, that is, towards the west [Fig. 12.5 (b)]. It means that\nthe direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reversed.\nFigure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5 A simple electric circuit in which a straight copper wire is placed parallel to and over a compass\nneedle.

Take care that the cardboard is fixed and\ndoes not slide up or down.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 199What happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a\ngiven point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary\nthe curr ent in the wire. W e find that the deflection in the needle also\nchanges. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases.\nIt indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given\npoint increases as the current through the wire increases.\nWhat happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved\naway from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the\nsame? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the\nconducting wir e (say at point Q). What change do you observe? W e see\nthat the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field\nproduced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance\nfrom it increases. From Fig. 12.6, it can be noticed that the concentric\ncircles representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straight\nwire become larger and larger as we move away from it.\n12.2.2 Right-Hand Thumb Rule\nA convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated\nwith a current-carrying conductor i\ns given in Fig. 12.7./square6Connect the copper wire vertically between the\npoints X and Y, as shown in Fig. 12.6 (a), in\nseries with the battery, a plug and key.\n/square6Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the\ncardboar d.

Place a compass at a point (say P) over\na circle. Observe the direction of the needle.

Then your fingers will wrap around the\nconductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as\nshown in Fig. 12.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule *.\nExample 12.1\nA current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west\ndirection. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly\nbelow it and at a point directly above it?\nSolution\nThe current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand\nthumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or\nabove the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,\nwhen viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed\nfrom the west end.Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7\nRight-hand thumb rule\n*This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a\ncorkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of\ncorkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field.12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a\nCircular Loop\nWe have so far observed the patter n of the magnetic field lines\nproduced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose\nthis straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a\ncurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? W e know that the magnetic field produced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic\nfield around it would become larger and larger as we move\naway from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nappear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\ncurrent would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nstraight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right\nhand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire\ncontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop.Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8\nMagnetic field lines of the field\nproduced by a current-carrying\ncircular loop?QUESTIONS\n1.

Why don’t two magnetic field lines intersect each other?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 201We know that the magnetic field produced by a curr ent-carrying\nwire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.\nTherefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is\nn times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the\ncurrent in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to\neach turn then just adds up.\nActivity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6\n/square6Take a rectangular cardboard having two holes.\nInsert a circular coil having large number of turns\nthrough them, normal to the plane of the cardboard.\n/square6Connect the ends of the coil in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat, as shown in Fig. 12.9.\n/square6Sprinkle iron filings uniformly on the cardboard.\n/square6Plug the key.\n/square6Tap the cardboard gently a few times. Note the\npattern of the iron filings that emerges on the\ncardboard.Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9\nMagnetic field produced by a current-\ncarrying circular coil.\n12.2.4 Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Solenoid\nA coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped\nclosely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. The pattern\nof the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid is\nshown in Fig. 12.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the\nmagnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). Do they look\nsimilar? Y es, they are similar . In fact, one end of the solenoid\nbehaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the\nsouth pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of\nparallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is\nthe same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is\nuniform inside the solenoid.\nA strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be\nused to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron,\nwhen placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11). The magnet so formed is\ncalled an electromagnet.Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10\nField lines of the magnetic field\nthrough and around a current\ncarrying solenoid.\nFigure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11\nA current-carrying solenoid coil\nis used to magnetise steel rod\ninside it – an electromagnet.QUESTIONS\n?1.

The field so produced exerts a force on a\nmagnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor . French scientist Andre\nMarie Ampere (1775–1836) suggested that the magnet must also exert\nan equal and opposite for ce on the curr ent-carrying conductor . The for ce\ndue to a magnetic field acting on a current-carrying conductor can be\ndemonstrated through the following activity.3. Choose the correct option.\nThe magnetic field inside a long straight solenoid-carrying current\n(a) is zero.\n(b) decreases as we move towards its end.\n(c) increases as we move towards its end.\n(d) is the same at all points.\nActivity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7\n/square6Take a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm). Using\ntwo connecting wires suspend it horizontally from a\nstand, as shown in Fig. 12.12.\n/square6Place a strong horse-shoe magnet in such a way that\nthe rod lies between the two poles with the magnetic\nfield directed upwards. For this put the north pole of\nthe magnet vertically below and south pole vertically\nabove the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).\n/square6Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat.\n/square6Now pass a current through the aluminium rod from\nend B to end A.\n/square6What do you observe?

Support for the\nmagnet is not shown here, for simplicity.\nThe displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a\nforce is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed\nin a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also\nreversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed.\nNow change the direction of field to vertically downwards by\ninterchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 203the direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. It\nshows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the\ndirection of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments\nhave shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude\nof the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles\nto the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a\nsimple rule to find the dir ection of the for ce on the conductor .\nIn Activity 12.7, we considered the\ndirection of the current and that of the magnetic\nfield perpendicular to each other and found\nthat the force is perpendicular to both of them.\nThe three directions can be illustrated through\na simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule.\nAccording to this rule, stretch the thumb,\nforefinger and middle finger of your left hand\nsuch that they are mutually perpendicular\n(Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in the\ndirection of magnetic field and the second\nfinger in the direction of current, then the\nthumb will point in the direction of motion or\nthe for ce acting on the conductor .\nDevices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields\ninclude electric motor , electric generator , loudspeakers, microphones\nand measuring instruments.\nExample 12.2\nAn electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown\nin Fig. 12.14. The direction of force acting on the electron will be\n(a) to the right.\n(b)to the left.\n(c)out of the page.\n(d)into the page.\nSolution\nAnswer is option (d). The direction of force is perpendicular to the\ndirection of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming’s left hand\nrule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction\nof motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13\nFleming’s left-hand rule\nFigure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14\nQUESTIONS\n?1.

One of the wires in this supply, usually with\nred insulation cover , is called live wir e (or positive). Another wir e, with\nblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the\npotential dif ference between the two is 220 V .\nAt the meter -boar d in the house, these wir es pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wir e, which has insulation of gr een colour , is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster , table fan,\nrefrigerator , etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wir e, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock.2. In Activity 12.7, how do we think the displacement of rod AB will be\naffected if (i) current in rod AB is increased; (ii) a stronger horse-shoe\nmagnet is used; and (iii) length of the rod AB is increased?\n3.

Even weak ion currents that\ntravel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch\nsomething, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. This\nimpulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and are\nabout one-billionth of the earth’s magnetic field. Two main organs in the human\nbody where the magnetic field produced is significant , are the heart and the brain. The\nmagnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body\nparts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysis\nof these images helps in medical diagnosis.

In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other .\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic cir cuits. W e\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.\n1. Name two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and\nappliances.\n2.

The fish would need a free space for swimming (it\ncould be a lar ge jar), water , oxygen and food.\n/square6We can pr ovide oxygen thr ough an oxygen pump (aerator) and\nfish food which is available in the market.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nOur Environment 209/square6If we add a few aquatic plants and animals it can become a self-\nsustaining system. Can you think how this happens? An aquarium\nis an example of a human-made ecosystem.\n/square6Can we leave the aquarium as such after we set it up? Why does\nit have to be cleaned once in a while? Do we have to clean ponds\nor lakes in the same manner? Why or why not?\nWe have seen in earlier classes that organisms can be gr ouped as\nproducers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in\nwhich they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall\nwhat we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by\nus above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar\nand starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the\nSun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria\nwhich can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category\nand are called the producers.\nOrganisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for\ntheir sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced,\neither directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers\nare the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores,\ncarnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of\nthese categories of consumers?\n/square6Imagine the situation where you do not clean the  aquarium and\nsome fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what\nhappens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising\nbacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and waste\nproducts of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers\nas they break-down the complex organic substances into simple\ninorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once\nmore by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead\nanimals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment\nof the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there?\nActivity 13.2Activity 13.2Activity 13.2Activity 13.2Activity 13.2\n/square6While creating an aquarium did you take care not to put an aquatic\nanimal which would eat others?

This series or or ganisms taking part at\nvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1).\nEach step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level.\nThe autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level.\nThey fix up the solar energy and make it available for\nheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary\nconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or\nthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2).\nWe know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to pr ovide us\nenergy to do work. Thus the interactions among various\ncomponents of the environment involves flow of energy from\none component of the system to another . As we have studied,\nthe autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and\nconvert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the\nactivities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes\nto the heter otrophs and decomposers. However , as we saw in\nthe previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form\nof ener gy is changed to another , some ener gy is lost to the\nenvironment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow\nof energy between various components of the environment\nhas been extensively studied and it has been found that –\n/square6The green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about\n1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it\ninto food energy.\n/square6When green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal\nof energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes\ninto digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth\nand reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned\ninto its own body and made available for the next level of\nconsumers.\n/square6Therefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount\nof organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next\nlevel of consumers.\n/square6Since so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,\nfood chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss\nof energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy\nremains after four trophic levels.\n/square6There are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower\ntrophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the\nproducers.\n/square6The length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism\nis generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in\nturn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight\nline food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching\nlines called a food web (Fig. 13.3).Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1\nFood chain in nature\n(a) in forest, (b) in\ngrassland and (c) in a\npond\nReprint 2025-26\n\nOur Environment 211From the energy flow diagram (Fig. 13.4),\ntwo things become clear . Firstly, the flow of\nenergy is unidirectional. The energy that is\ncaptured by the autotrophs does not revert\nback to the solar input and the energy which\npasses to the herbivores does not come back\nto autotrophs. As it moves progressively\nthrough the various trophic levels it is no\nlonger available to the previous level.\nSecondly, the energy available at each trophic\nlevel gets diminished progressively due to loss\nof energy at each level.\nAnother interesting aspect of food chain\nis how unknowingly some harmful\nchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. Y ou have read in Class IX how water\ngets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests.\nThese chemicals are either washed down into\nthe soil or into the water bodies. From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plants\nFigure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystemFigure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3\nFood web, consisting of\nmany food chains\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 212Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3and animals. This is one of the ways in which they enter the food chain.\nAs these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated\nprogressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the top\nlevel in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals\nget accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological\nmagnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat\nand rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts\nof pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or\nother means.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What are trophic levels? Give an example of a food chain and state the\ndifferent trophic levels in it.\n2.

In\nthis chapter , we shall be looking at two of the envir\nonmental pr oblems\nin detail, that is, depletion of the ozone layer and waste disposal.\n13.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted\nOzone (O3) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O2,\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However , at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiation/square6Newspaper reports about pesticide levels in ready-made food items\nare often seen these days and some states have banned these\nproducts. Debate in groups the need for such bans.\n/square6What do you think would be the source of pesticides in these food\nitems? Could pesticides get into our bodies from this source through\nother food products too?\n/square6Discuss what methods could be applied to reduce our intake of\npesticides.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nOur Environment 213Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4is highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin\ncancer in human beings.\nOzone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV\nradiation acting on oxygen (O2) molecule. The higher energy UV\nradiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O2) into free oxygen (O)\natoms. These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form\nozone as shown—\nO O+O2UV →  \nO O O2 3\nOzone )+ →\n(\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in\nthe 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire\nextinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at\n1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies\nto make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.\n/square6Collect waste material from your homes. This could include all\nthe waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,\nvegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),\nwaste paper , empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and\ntorn clothes and br oken footwear .\n/square6Bury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is no\nspace available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/\nflower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil.\n/square6Keep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals.\n/square6What are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods\nof time?\n/square6What are the materials which change their form and structure\nover time?\n/square6Of these materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest?/square6Find out from the library, internet or newspaper reports, which\nchemicals ar e responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer .\n/square6Find out if the regulations put in place to control the emission of\nthese chemicals have succeeded in reducing the damage to the\nozone layer .

What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we\nthrow them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these\nquestions.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 214We have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Pr ocesses’ that the food we eat is\ndigested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why\nthe same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are\nspecific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-down\nof a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we\ntry to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics\nwill not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes.\nThese materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and\npressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment,\nthese persist for a long time.\nSubstances that are broken down by biological processes are said\nto be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were\nbiodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner\nare said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert and\nsimply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various\nmembers of the eco-system.\nActivity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6\n/square6Use the library or internet to find out more about biodegradable\nand non-biodegradable substances.\n/square6How long are various non-biodegradable substances expected to\nlast in our environment?\n/square6These days, new types of plastics which are said to be biodegradable\nare available.

The intr oduction of\ndisposable cups was hailed as a step forward for reasons of hygiene. No one at that time\nperhaps thought about the impact caused by the disposal of millions of these cups on a\ndaily basis. Some time back, kulhads , that is, disposable cups made of clay, were\nsuggested as an alternative. But a little thought showed that making these \nkulhads  on\na large scale would result in the loss of the fertile top-soil. Now disposable paper -cups\nare being used.

This description of a\nchemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a\nshorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a\nword-equation.\nThe word-equation for the above reaction would be –\nMagnesium + Oxygen →Magnesium oxide (1.1)\n            (Reactants) (Product)\nThe substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),\nmagnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is\nmagnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.\nA word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an\narrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand\nside (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are\nwritten on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.\nThe arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of\nthe reaction.You must have observed that magnesium ribbon bur ns with a\ndazzling white flame and changes into a white powder . This powder is\nmagnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium\nand oxygen present in the air .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations 31.1.1 W riting a Chemical Equation\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?\nChemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\nMg + O2  →  MgO (1.2)\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the bur ning of magnesium in air .\n1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.\nThe word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –\nZinc + Sulphuric acid  →  Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen\nThe above word-equation may be represented by the following\nchemical equation –\nZn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2(1.3)\nLet us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both\nsides of the arrow.\nElement Number of atoms in Number of atoms\nreactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\nZn 1 1\nH 2 2\nS 1 1\nO 4 4\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.\nLet us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2(1.4)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 4Step I:  To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation.\nFe   +   H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   H2(1.5)\nStep II:  List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5).\nElement Number of atoms Number of atoms\nin reactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\nFe 1 3\nH 2 2\nO 1 4\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecome s–\nFe   +   4 H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   H2\nStep IV:  Fe and H atoms ar e still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further . Let us balance hydr ogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation.\nTo equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.Step III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound\nthat contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element\noxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on\nthe LHS.\nTo balance the oxygen atoms –\nThe equation would be –\n  Fe   +   4   H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   4 H2Atoms of In reactants In products\noxygen\n(i)Initial 1 (in H2O) 4 (in Fe3O4)\n(ii)To balance 1×4 4\nAtoms of In reactants In products\nhydrogen\n(i)Initial 8 (in 4 H2O) 2 (in H2)\n(ii)To balance 8 2 × 4(1.6)\n(partly balanced equation)\n(1.7)\n(partly balanced equation)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations 5To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.\n3   Fe   +   4   H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   4   H2(1.8)\nStep VI:  Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we\ncount atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.\n3Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 + 4H2\nThe numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are\nequal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical\nequations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance\nthe equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.\nStep VII: Writing Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical States   Car efully examine\nthe above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about\nthe physical state of each reactant and product? No information has\nbeen given in this equation about their physical states.\nTo make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\nis present as a solution in water .\nThe balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g)  → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g) (1.10)\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this\nreaction water is used in the form of steam.\nUsually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\nit is necessary to specify them.\nSometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\nin the equation.

This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous\nsulphate crystals (FeSO4. 7H2O) lose water when heated and the colour\nof the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe2O3),\nsulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Ferric oxide is a solid,\nwhile SO2 and SO3 are gases.\nDecomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon\ndioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in\nvarious industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has\nmany uses – one is in the manufacture of cement.

This process\nis commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get\ntarnished in this manner . Have you noticed the colour of the coating\nformed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances\naround it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this\nprocess is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green\ncoating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships\nand to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron.

Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.\nAcids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, N O3– in\nHNO3, SO2–\n4 in H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COO\nH. Since the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.\nRepeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?\n2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a W ater Solution?\nDo acids produce ions only in aqueous solution?

The separation of H+ ion fr om HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water .\nHCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+).\nH+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water .

Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water . The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.\nThe glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 252.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\nWe know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. W e have also lear nt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator , which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘ potenz ’ in German,\nmeaning power . On the pH scale we can measur e pH generally fr om\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. V alues less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.QUESTIONS\n?1.

If we take hydrochloric acid and\nacetic acid of the same concentration, say one molar , then these pr oduce\ndifferent amounts of hydrogen ions. Acids that give rise to more H+ ions\nare said to be strong acids, and acids that give less H+ ions are said to be\nweak acids.

It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.\nDuring indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes\npain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter . These antacids neutralise the excess acid.\nMagnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for\nthis purpose.\npH change as the cause of tooth decay\nTooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth\nenamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium\nphosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in\nwater , but is corr oded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria\npresent in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food\nparticles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent\nthis is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are\ngenerally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and\nprevent tooth decay.\nSelf defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare\nHave you ever been stung by a honey-bee?

This is the salt that you use in food.\nYou must have observed in the above Activity\nthat it is a neutral salt.\nSeawater contains many salts dissolved\nin it. Sodium chloride is separated from these\nsalts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in\nseveral parts of the world. These large crystals\nare often brown due to impurities. This is\ncalled rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed\nwhen seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt\nis mined like coal.\nYou must have hear d about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi  March.

Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\nSodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor -alkali pr ocess because of the pr oducts for med–\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) ® 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products.\nBleaching powder\nYou have alr eady come to know that chlorine is pr oduced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufactur e of bleaching powder . Bleaching powder is pr oduced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder\nis represented as Ca(ClO)2, though the actual composition is quite\ncomplex.\n2Ca(OH)2 + 2Cl2 ® Ca(ClO)2 + CaCl2 + 2H2OFigure 2.8  Important products from the chlor-alkali process\nReprint 2025-26\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 31Bleaching powder is used –\n(i)for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching\nwood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes\nin laundry;\n(ii)as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and\n(iii)to make drinking water free from germs.\nBaking soda\nThe baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy\npakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical\nname of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3). It is\nproduced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.\nNaCl + H O + CO + NH NH Cl + NaHCO2 2 3 4 3 →\n(Ammonium (Sodium\nchloride) hydrogencarbonate)\nDid you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in Activity 2.14?\nCan you correlate why it can be used to neutralise an acid?

When baking powder is heated or mixed in water ,\nthe following reaction takes place –\nNaHCO3 + H+      →     CO2 + H2O + Sodium salt of acid\n         (From any acid)\nCarbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or\ncake to rise making them soft and spongy.\n(ii)Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.\nBeing alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and\nprovides relief.\n(iii)It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.\nWashing soda\nAnother chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is\nNa2CO3.10H2O (washing soda). Y ou have seen above that sodium\ncarbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda; recrystallisation of\nsodium carbonate gives washing soda.

Now you would be able to answer the question\nwhether the molecule of Na2CO3.10H2O is wet.\nOne other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum.\nIt has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical\nformula CaSO4.2H2O. Let us look into the use of this salt.\nPlaster of Paris\nOn heating gypsum at 373 K, it loses water molecules and becomes\ncalcium sulphate hemihydrate  ( 4 21CaSO . H O2). This is called Plaster of\nReprint 2025-26\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 33Paris, the substance which doctors use as plaster for supporting\nfractured bones in the right position.

Let us study this with the help of the following\nactivities. For performing A ctivities 3.1 to 3.6, collect the samples of\nfollowing metals –  iron, copper , aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead,\nzinc and any other metal that is easily available.\nActivity 3.1Activity 3.1Activity 3.1Activity 3.1Activity 3.1\n/square6Take samples of  ir on, copper , aluminium and magnesium. Note\nthe appearance of each sample.\n/square6Clean the surface of each sample by rubbing them with sand paper\nand note their appearance again.\nMetals, in their pure state, have a shining surface. This property is\ncalled metallic lustre.\nActivity 3.2Activity 3.2Activity 3.2Activity 3.2Activity 3.2\n/square6Take small pieces of ir on, copper , aluminium, and magnesium.\nTry to cut these metals with a sharp knife and note your\nobservations.\n/square6Hold a piece of sodium metal with a pair of tongs.\nCAUTION:  Always handle sodium metal with care. Dry it by\npressing between the folds of a filter paper .\n/square6Put it on a watch-glass and try to cut it with a knife.\n/square6What do you observe?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 38You will find that some metals can be beaten into thin sheets. This\nproperty is called malleability. Did you know that gold and silver are the\nmost malleable metals?Activity 3.3Activity 3.3Activity 3.3Activity 3.3Activity 3.3\n/square6Take pieces of ir on, zinc, lead and copper .\n/square6Place any one metal on a block of iron and strike it four or five\ntimes with a hammer . What do you observe?\n/square6Repeat with other metals.\n/square6Record the change in the shape of these metals.You will find that metals ar e generally har d. The har dness varies\nfrom metal to metal.\nActivity 3.4Activity 3.4Activity 3.4Activity 3.4Activity 3.4\n/square6List the metals whose wires you have seen in daily life.\nThe ability of metals to be drawn into thin wires is called ductility.\nGold is the most ductile metal. Y ou will be surprised to know that a wir e\nof about 2 km length can be drawn from one gram of gold.\nIt is because of their malleability and ductility that metals can be\ngiven different shapes according to our needs.\nCan you name some metals that are used for making cooking vessels?\nDo you know why these metals are used for making vessels? Let us do\nthe following Activity to find out the answer .\nActivity 3.5Activity 3.5Activity 3.5Activity 3.5Activity 3.5\n/square6Take an aluminium or copper\nwire.

Does\nthe metal wire melt?\nThe above activity shows that metals are good conductors of heat\nand have high melting points. The best conductors of heat are silver and\ncopper . Lead and mer cury are comparatively poor conductors of heat.\nDo metals also conduct electricity? Let us find out.Figure 3.1Figure 3.1Figure 3.1Figure 3.1Figure 3.1\nMetals are good\nconductors of heat.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMetals and Non-metals 39You must have seen that the wir es that carry curr ent\nin your homes have a coating of polyvinylchloride (PVC)\nor a rubber -like material. Why ar e electric wir es coated\nwith such substances?\nWhat happens when metals strike a hard surface? Do they produce\na sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface\nare said to be sonorous. Can you now say why school bells are made of\nmetals?\n3.1.2 Non-metals\nIn the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals\nas compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon,\nsulphur , iodine, oxygen, hydr ogen, etc. The non-metals ar e either  solids\nor gases except bromine which is a liquid.\nDo non-metals also have physical properties similar to that of metals?\nLet us find out.Activity 3.6Activity 3.6Activity 3.6Activity 3.6Activity 3.6\n/square6Set up an electric circuit as shown in Fig. 3.2.\n/square6Place the metal to be tested in the circuit\nbetween terminals A and B as shown.\n/square6Does the bulb glow? What does this indicate?\nFigure 3.2Figure 3.2Figure 3.2Figure 3.2Figure 3.2\nMetals are good\nconductors of electricity.\nActivity 3.7Activity 3.7Activity 3.7Activity 3.7Activity 3.7\n/square6Collect samples of carbon (coal or graphite), sulphur and iodine.\n/square6Carry out the Activities 3.1 to 3.4 and 3.6 with these non-metals\nand record your observations.\nCompile your observations regarding metals and non-metals in Table 3.1.\nTable 3.1\nElement Symbol Type of Hardness Malleability Ductility Conducts Sonority\nsurface Electricity\nOn the bases of the observations recorded in Table 3.1, discuss the\ngeneral physical properties of metals and non-metals in the class. Y ou\nmust have concluded that we cannot group elements according to their\nphysical properties alone, as there are many exceptions. For example –\n(i)All metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature.\nIn Activity 3.5, you have observed that metals have high melting\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 40points but gallium and caesium have very low melting points.\nThese two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm.\n(ii)Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.\n(iii)Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each\nform is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is\nthe hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting\nand boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a\nconductor of electricity.\n(iv)Alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they\ncan be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting\npoints.\nElements can be more clearly classified as metals and non-metals\non the basis of their chemical properties.\nActivity 3.8Activity 3.8Activity 3.8Activity 3.8Activity 3.8\n/square6Take a magnesium ribbon and some sulphur powder .\n/square6Burn the magnesium ribbon.

Give an example of a metal which\n(i)is a liquid at room temperature.\n(ii)can be easily cut with a knife.\n(iii)is the best conductor of heat.\n(iv)is a poor conductor of heat.\n2.Explain the meanings of malleable and ductile.\n3.2 CHEMIC3.2 CHEMIC3.2 CHEMIC3.2 CHEMIC3.2 CHEMIC AL PROPERTIES OF METAL PROPERTIES OF METAL PROPERTIES OF METAL PROPERTIES OF METAL PROPERTIES OF MET ALS ALSALS ALSALS\nWe will lear n about the chemical pr operties of metals in the following\nSections 3.2.1 to 3.2.4. For this, collect the samples of following metals –\naluminium, copper , iron, lead, magnesium, zinc and sodium. Most non-metals pr oduce acidic oxides when dissolve in water . On\nthe other hand, most metals, give rise to basic oxides. Y ou will be lear ning\nmore about these metal oxides in the next section.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMetals and Non-metals 413.2.1 What happens when Metals are bur nt in Air?\nYou have seen in Activity 3.8 that magnesium bur ns in air with a dazzling\nwhite flame. Do all metals react in the same manner? Let us check by\nperforming the following Activity.\nActivity 3.9Activity 3.9Activity 3.9Activity 3.9Activity 3.9\nCAUTION : The following activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\nIt would be better if students wear eye protection.\n/square6Hold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try\nburning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples.\n/square6Collect the product if formed.\n/square6Let the products and the metal surface cool down.\n/square6Which metals burn easily?\n/square6What flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt?\n/square6How does the metal surface appear after burning?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity\ntowards oxygen.\n/square6Are the products soluble in water?\nAlmost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.\nMetal  +  Oxygen → Metal oxide\n For example, when copper is heated in air , it combines with oxygen\nto form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.\n2Cu  +  O2  →  2CuO\n(Copper)      (Copper(II) oxide)\nSimilarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.\n4Al +3O2 → 2Al2O3\n(Aluminium) (Aluminium oxide)\nRecall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.\nWe have lear nt that metal oxides ar e basic in natur e. But some metal\noxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as\nbasic behaviour . Such metal oxides which r eact with both acids as well as\nbases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.\nAluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases –\nAl2O3 + 6HCl →2AlCl3+3H2O\nAl2O3 + 2NaOH →2NaAlO2+H2O\n(Sodium\naluminate)\n Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve\nin water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in\nwater to produce alkalis as follows –\nNa2O(s) +H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq)\nK2O(s) +H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 42We have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not r eact with\noxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities\ntowards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the bur ner. Copper does not bur n, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures.Do Y ou Know?Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air . This aluminium oxide coat makes it\nresistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the\noxide layer thicker .  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode\nreacts with aluminium to make a thicker pr otective oxide layer .  This oxide layer can\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.\nBut burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a\nconclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.\n3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with W ater?\nActivity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10\nCAUTION:  This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\n/square6Collect the samples of the same metals as in Activity 3.9.\n/square6Put small pieces of the samples separately in beakers half-filled\nwith cold water .\n/square6Which metals reacted with cold water? Arrange them in the\nincreasing or der of their r eactivity with cold water .\n/square6Did any metal produce fire on water?\n/square6Does any metal start floating after some time?\n/square6Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers\nhalf-filled with hot water .\n/square6For the metals that did not r eact with hot water , arrange the\napparatus as shown in Fig.  3.3 and observe their reaction with steam.\n/square6Which metals did not react even with steam?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decr easing or der of r eactivity with water .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMetals and Non-metals 43Metals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen\ngas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form\nmetal hydr oxide. But all metals do not r eact with water .\nMetal +Water →Metal oxide + Hydrogen\nMetal oxide +Water →Metal hydroxide\nMetals like potassium and sodium r eact violently with cold water . In\ncase of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic\nthat the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.\n2K(s)   + 2H2O(l) →  2KOH(aq)  +  H2(g) + heat energy\n2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat energy\nThe reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is\nnot sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.\nCa(s) + 2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)\nCalcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed\nstick to the surface of the metal.\nMagnesium does not react with cold water . It reacts with hot water\nto form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due\nto the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.\nMetals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or\nhot water . But they r eact with steam to for m the metal oxide and hydr ogen.\n2Al(s) +3H2O(g) → Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)\n3Fe(s) +4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\nMetals such as  lead, copper , silver and gold do not r eact with water at all.\n3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with Acids?\nYou have alr eady lear nt that metals r eact with acids to give a salt and\nhydrogen gas.Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3  Action of steam on a metal\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 44Metal + Dilute acid →  Salt + Hydrogen\nBut do all metals react in the same manner? Let us find out.\nActivity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11\n/square6Collect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again.\nIf the samples ar e tar nished, rub them clean with sand paper .\nCAUTION:  Do not take sodium and potassium as they react\nvigorously even with cold water .\n/square6Put the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute\nhydrochloric acid.\n/square6Suspend thermometers in the test tubes, so that their bulbs are\ndipped in the acid.\n/square6Observe the rate of formation of bubbles carefully.\n/square6Which metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid?\n/square6With which metal did you record the highest temperature?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute\nacids.\nWrite equations for the r eactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc\nand iron with dilute hydrochloric acid.\nHydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is\nbecause HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H2 produced to\nwater and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO,\nNO2). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute\nHNO3 to evolve H2 gas.\nYou must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of for mation\nof bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was\nalso the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the\norder Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper , no bubbles wer e seen and\nthe temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does\nnot react with dilute HCl.Do Y ou Know?Aqua regia,  (Latin for ‘royal water’) is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated\nhydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It can dissolve\ngold, even though neither of these acids can do so alone. Aqua regia  is a highly\ncorrosive, fuming liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is able to dissolve gold and\nplatinum.\n3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of other Metal\nSalts?\nActivity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12\n/square6Take a clean wire of copper and an iron nail.\n/square6Put the copper wire in a solution of iron sulphate and the iron\nnail in a solution of copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig. 3.4).\n/square6Record your observations after 20 minutes.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMetals and Non-metals 45/square6In which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred?\n/square6On what basis can you say that a reaction has actually taken\nplace?\n/square6Can you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10\nand 3.11?\n/square6Write a balanced chemical equation for the r eaction that has taken\nplace.\n/square6Name the type of reaction.\nReactive metals can displace less\nreactive metals from their compounds in\nsolution or molten form.\nWe have seen in the pr evious sections\nthat all metals ar e not equally r eactive. W e\nchecked the reactivity of various metals\nwith oxygen, water and acids. But all\nmetals do not react with these reagents.\nSo we were not able to put all the metal\nsamples we had collected in decreasing\norder of their reactivity. Displacement\nreactions studied in Chapter 1 give better\nevidence about the reactivity of metals. It\nis simple and easy if metal A displaces\nmetal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.\nMetal A + Salt solution of B →  Salt solution of A + Metal B\nWhich metal, copper or iron, is more reactive according to your\nobservations in Activity 3.12?\n3.2.5 The Reactivity Series\nThe reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their\ndecreasing activities. After performing displacement experiments\n(Activities 1.9 and 3.12), the following series, (Table 3.2) known as the\nreactivity or activity series has been developed.\nTable 3.2 Activity series : Relative reactivities of metals\nK Potassium Most reactive\nNa Sodium\nCa Calcium\nMg Magnesium\nAl Aluminium\nZn Zinc Reactivity decreases\nFe Iron\nPb Lead\n[H] [Hydrogen]\nCu Copper\nHg Mercury\nAg Silver\nAu Gold Least reactiveFigure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4\nReaction of metals with\nsalt solutions\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 46?QUESTIONS\n1. Why is sodium kept immersed in kerosene oil?\n2. Write equations for the r eactions of\n(i)iron with steam\n(ii)calcium and potassium with water\n3. Samples of four metals A, B, C and D were taken and added to the\nfollowing solution one by one.

CT?CT?\nIn the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a number of\nreagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we\nlearnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. W e\nlearnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show\nlittle chemical activity. W e, ther efore, explain the r eactivity of elements\nas a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\nsome metals and non-metals.\nWe can see fr om Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electr on in its\noutermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell\nnow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus\nof this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has\nbecome 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation\nNa+. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shellUse the Table above to answer the following questions about metals\nA, B, C and D.\n(i)Which is the most reactive metal?\n(ii) What would you observe if B is added to a solution of Copper(II)\nsulphate?\n(iii) Arrange the metals A, B, C and D in the order of decreasing\nreactivity.\n4. Which gas is produced when dilute hydrochloric acid is added to a\nreactive metal? W rite the chemical r eaction when ir on reacts with dilute\nH2SO4.\n5. What would you observe when zinc is added to a solution of iron(II)\nsulphate? W rite the chemical r eaction that takes place.Metal Iron(II) sulphate Copper(II) sulphate Zinc sulphate Silver nitrate\nA No reaction Displacement\nB Displacement No reaction\nC No reaction No reaction No reaction Displacement\nD No reaction No reaction No reaction No reaction\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMetals and Non-metals 47and it requires one more electron to complete its octet. If sodium and chlorine\nwere to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine.\nAfter gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,\nbecause its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L\nand M shells.  This gives us a chloride anion C1–. So both these elements\ncan have a give-and-take relation between them as follows (Fig. 3.5).\nNa Na + e\n2,8,1 2,8+\n(Sodiu\nm cation )→–\nCl +e Cl\n2,8,7 2,8,8\n(Chloride anion )– –→\nFigure 3.5Figure 3.5Figure 3.5Figure 3.5Figure 3.5  Formation of sodium chloride\nSodium and chloride ions, being oppositely charged, attract each\nother and are held by strong electrostatic forces of attraction to exist as\nsodium chloride (NaCl).

These compounds are generally brittle and\nbreak into pieces when pressure is applied.\n(ii)Melting and Boiling points : Ionic compounds have high melting\nand boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable\namount of ener gy is r equir ed to br eak the str ong inter -ionic\nattraction.\n(iii) Solubility : Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in\nwater and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.\n(iv)Conduction of Electricity : The conduction of electricity through\na solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution\nof an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the\nopposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the\nsolution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct\nelectricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible\ndue to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct\nelectricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state\nsince the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely\ncharged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move\nfreely and conduct electricity.\nQUESTIONS\n?1.

Why do ionic compounds have high melting points?\n3.4 3.43.4 3.43.4OCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF MET ALSALSALS\nALSALS\nThe earth’s crust is the major source of metals. Seawater also contains\nsome soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.\nThe elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust,\nare known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high\npercentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted\nfrom it. These minerals are called ores.\n3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\nYou have lear nt about the r eactivity series of metals. Having this\nknowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its\nore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some\nare found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of\nthe activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 50state. For example, gold, silver , platinum and copper ar e found in the\nfree state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as\ntheir sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series\n(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in\nnature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s\ncrust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. Y ou will find that\nthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very\nreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\nThus on th e basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques\nare to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.K\nNa\nCa\nMg\nAl\nZn\nFe\nPb\nCu\nAg\nAuReduction using\ncarbon\nFound in native\nstateElectrolysis\nFigure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9\nActivity series and\nrelated metallurgy\nFigure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10  Steps involved in the extraction of metals from ores\n3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores\nOres mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts\nof impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must\nbe removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processesSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from\nores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is\nexplained in detail in the following sections.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMetals and Non-metals 51used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences\nbetween the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore.\nDifferent separation techniques are  accordingly employed.\n3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these\nmetals can be  reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\n(HgS) is an ore of mer cury. When it is heated in air , it is first converted\ninto mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury\non further heating.\n2HgS(s) + 3O (g) 2HgO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat →  \n2HgO(s) 2Hg(l) + O (g)2Heat →  \nSimilarly, copper which is found as Cu2S in nature can be obtained\nfrom its or e by just heating in air .\n2Cu S + 3O (g) 2Cu O(s) + 2SO (g)\n2Cu O + Cu S 2 2 2 2\n2 2Heat\nHeat →  \n →    6Cu(s) + SO (g)2\n3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series\nThe metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead,\ncopper , are moderately r eactive. These ar e usually pr esent as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the pr esence of excess air . This pr ocess is known as r oasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This pr ocess is known as calcination. The chemical r eaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows –\nRoasting\n2ZnS(s) + 3O (g) 2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat → \nCalcination\nZnCO (s) ZnO(s) + CO (g)3 2Heat →  \nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc\noxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.\nZnO(s) + C(s) → Zn(s) + CO(g)\nYou ar e already familiar with the pr ocess of oxidation and r eduction\nexplained in the first Chapter . Obtaining metals fr om their compounds\nis also a reduction process.\nBesides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,\nsometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive\nmetals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 52agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their\ncompounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with\naluminium powder , the following reaction takes place –\n3MnO2(s) + 4Al(s) → 3Mn(l) + 2Al2O3(s) + Heat\nCan you identify the substances that are getting oxidised\nand reduced?\nThese displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The\namount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced\nin the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3)\nwith aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked\nmachine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.\nFe2O3(s) + 2Al(s) → 2Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) + Heat\n3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the T op of the\nActivity Series\nThe metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium\nare obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals\nare deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,\nchlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The\nreactions are –\nAt cathode Na+ + e–→Na\nAt anode       2Cl –→Cl2 + 2e–\nSimilarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of\naluminium oxide.\n3.4.6 Refining of Metals\nThe metals produced by various reduction processes\ndescribed above are not very pure. They contain\nimpurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals.\nThe most widely used method for refining impure metals\nis electrolytic refining.\nElectrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Many metals, such as copper , zinc,\ntin, nickel, silver , gold, etc., ar e refined electr olytically. In\nthis process, the impure metal is made the anode and a\nthin strip of pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of\nthe metal salt is used as an electrolyte. The apparatus is\nset up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On passing the current\nthrough the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode\ndissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure\nFigure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11\nThermit process for\njoining railway tracks\nFigure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12\nElectr olytic r efining of copper .

It is, therefore, not suitable for making\njewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,\n22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is\nalloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver .\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical cir cuits. Solder , an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wir es together .\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desir ed pr operties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,\ndissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled\nto room temperature.\nIron pillar at DelhiThe wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy\nThe iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more\nthan 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India.  They had\ndeveloped a process which prevented iron from rusting. For\nits quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists\nfrom all parts of the world.

{"class": "10", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 5: life processes", "content": "Life Processes5 CHAPTER\nHow do we tell the difference between what is alive and what is not\nalive? If we see a dog running, or a cow chewing cud, or a man\nshouting loudly on the street, we know that these are living beings. What\nif the dog or the cow or the man wer e asleep? W e would still think that\nthey wer e alive, but how did we know that? W e see them br eathing, and\nwe know that they are alive. What about plants? How do we know that\nthey ar e alive? W e see them gr een, some of us will say. But what about\nplants that have leaves of colours other than green? They grow over\ntime, so we know that they are alive, some will say. In other words, we\ntend to think of some sort of movement, either growth-related or not, as\ncommon evidence for being alive. But a plant that is not visibly growing is\nstill alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So\nusing visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough.\nMovements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye –\nmovements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular\nmovement necessary for life? If we ask this question to professional\nbiologists, they will say yes. In fact, viruses do not show any molecular\nmovement in them (until they infect some cell), and that is partly why\nthere is a controversy about whether they are truly alive or not.\nWhy ar e molecular movements needed for life? W e have seen in earlier\nclasses that living organisms are well-organised structures; they can\nhave tissues, tissues have cells, cells have smaller components in them,\nand so on. Because of the effects of the environment, this organised,\nordered nature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down\nover time. If order breaks down, the organism will no longer be alive. So\nliving creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures.\nSince all these structures are made up of molecules, they must move\nmolecules around all the time.\nWhat are the maintenance processes in living organisms?\nLet us explore.\n5.1 WHA5.1 WHA5.1 WHA\n5.1 WHA5.1 WHA T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nThe maintenance functions of living organisms must go on even when\nthey ar e not doing anything particular . Even when we ar e just sitting in\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 80class, even if we are just asleep, this maintenance job has to go on.\nThe processes which together perform this maintenance job are\nlife processes.\nSince these maintenance processes are needed to prevent damage\nand break-down, energy is needed for them. This energy comes from\noutside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process\nto transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,\nwhich we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition.\nIf the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will\nalso be needed from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbon-\nbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based.\nDepending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different\norganisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes.\nThe outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the\nenvironment is not under the control of the individual organism. These\nsources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the\nbody, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that\ncan be used for the various molecular movements needed for\nmaintaining living str uctures, as well as to the kind of molecules the\nbody needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the\nbody are  necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most\ncommon chemical means to break -down molecules. For this, many\norganisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body. The process\nof acquiring oxygen from outside the body, and to use it  in the process\nof break -down of food sources for cellular needs, is what we call\nrespiration.\nIn the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking\nin food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because\nthe entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment.\nBut what happens when the body size of the organism increases and\nthe body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,\nall the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding\nenvironment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of\nall the cells.\nWe have seen pr eviously how, in multi-cellular or ganisms, various\nbody parts have specialised in the functions they per form. We are familiar\nwith the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in\nthe body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake\nof food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues.\nHowever , this poses a pr oblem, since the food and oxygen ar e now taken\nup at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body\nneed them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for\ncarrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body.\nWhen chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for\nenergy generation,  they create by-products that are not only useless\nfor the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste by-\nproducts are  therefore needed to be removed from the body and discarded\noutside  by a process called excretion. Again, if the basic rules for body\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLife Processes 81design in multi-cellular organisms are followed, a specialised tissue for\nexcretion will be developed, which means that the transportation system\nwill need to transport waste away from cells to this excretory tissue.\nLet us consider these various processes, so essential to maintain\nlife, one by one.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. Why is diffusion insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of multi-\ncellular organisms like humans?\n2. What criteria do we use to decide whether something is alive?\n3. What are outside raw materials used for by an organism?\n4. What processes would you consider essential for maintaining life?\n5.2 NUTRITION5.2 NUTRITION5.2 NUTRITION5.2 NUTRITION5.2 NUTRITION\nWhen we walk or ride a bicycle, we are using up energy. Even when we\nare not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a\nstate of or der in our body. W e also need materials fr om outside in or der\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat.\nHow do living things get their food?\nThe general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water . These or ganisms, the autotr ophs, include gr een\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances.\nThese complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs.\nHeterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.\n5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition\nCarbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are\nfulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take\nin substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of\nenergy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water\nwhich is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and\nchlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.\nWe will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates\nwhich are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which\nserves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required\nby the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of\nthe energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form\nof glycogen.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 82Let us now see what actually happens during the process of\nphotosynthesis. The following events occur during this process –\nFigure 5.2Figure 5.2Figure 5.2Figure 5.2Figure 5.2\nVariegated leaf (a) befor e\nand (b) after starch testFigure 5.1Figure 5.1Figure 5.1Figure 5.1Figure 5.1\nCross-section of a leaf\nActivity 5.1Activity 5.1Activity 5.1Activity 5.1Activity 5.1\n/square6Take a potted plant with variegated leaves – for example, money plant\nor crotons.\n/square6Keep the plant in a dark room for three days so that all the starch\ngets used up.\n/square6Now keep the plant in sunlight for about six hours.\n/square6Pluck a leaf from the plant.

What is the colour of the\nsolution?\n/square6Now dip the leaf in a dilute solution of iodine for a few minutes.\n/square6Take out the leaf and rinse off the iodine solution.\n/square6Observe the colour of the leaf and compare this with the tracing of\nthe leaf done in the beginning (Fig. 5.2).\n/square6What can you conclude about the presence of starch in various areas\nof the leaf?(i)Absorption of light energy by\nchlorophyll.\n(ii)Conversion of light energy to chemical\nenergy and splitting of water molecules\ninto hydrogen and oxygen.\n(iii)Reduction of carbon dioxide to\ncarbohydrates.\nThese steps need not take place one after\nthe other immediately. For example, desert\nplants take up carbon dioxide at night and\nprepare an intermediate which is acted upon\nby the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll\nduring the day.\nLet us see how each of the components of\nthe above reaction are necessary for\nphotosynthesis.\nIf you carefully observe a cross-section of a\nleaf under the microscope (shown in Fig. 5.1),\nyou will notice that some cells contain green\ndots. These green dots are cell organelles called\nchloroplasts which contain chlorophyll. Let us\ndo an activity which demonstrates that\nchlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLife Processes 83Now, let us study how the plant\nobtains carbon dioxide. In Class IX,\nwe had talked about stomata (Fig. 5.3)\nwhich are tiny pores present on the\nsurface of the leaves. Massive amounts\nof gaseous exchange takes place in the\nleaves through these pores for the\npurpose of photosynthesis. But it is\nimportant to note here that exchange\nof gases occurs across the surface of\nstems, roots and leaves as well. Since\nlarge amounts of water can also be lost\nthrough these stomata, the plant\ncloses these pores when it does not\nneed carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the\npore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water\nflows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore\ncloses if the guard cells shrink.\n/square6Take two healthy potted plants\nwhich are nearly the same size.\n/square6Keep them in a dark room for\nthree days.\n/square6Now place each plant on\nseparate glass plates. Place a\nwatch-glass containing potassium\nhydroxide by the side of one of\nthe plants.

But they also need other raw materials for building their\nbody. W ater used in photosynthesis is taken up fr om the soil by the\nroots in terrestrial plants. Other materials like nitrogen, phosphorus,\niron and magnesium are taken up from the soil. Nitrogen is an essential\nelement used in the synthesis of proteins and other compounds. This isFigure 5.4  Experimental set-up (a) with potassium\nhydroxide (b) without potassium hydroxide\n(a) (b)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 84taken up in the form of inorganic nitrates or nitrites. Or it is taken up as\norganic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from\natmospheric nitrogen.\n5.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition\nEach organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak- down the food material outside the body and then absorb it.\nExamples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or\nanimals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of or ganisms like cuscuta (amar -bel),  ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms.\n5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?\nSince the food and the way it is obtained dif fer, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food\nmay be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the\norganism increases, different parts become specialised to perform\ndifferent functions. For example, Amoeba takes in food using\ntemporary finger -like extensions of the cell sur face which fuse over\nthe food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 5.5). Inside the food-\nvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones\nwhich then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested\nmaterial is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In\nParamoecium , which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a\ndefinite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved\nto this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface\nof the cell.\n5.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings\nThe alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth\nto the anus. In Fig. 5.6, we can see that the tube has different parts.\nVarious r egions ar e specialised to per form dif ferent functions. What\nhappens to the food once it enters our body? W e shall discuss this\nprocess here.Figure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5\nNutrition in Amoeba\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLife Processes 85Activity 5.3Activity 5.3Activity 5.3Activity 5.3Activity 5.3\n/square6Take 1 mL starch solution (1%) in two test tubes (A and B).\n/square6Add 1 mL saliva to test tube A and leave both test tubes undisturbed\nfor 20-30 minutes.\n/square6Now add a few drops of dilute iodine solution to the test tubes.\n/square6In which test tube do you observe a colour change?\n/square6What does this indicate about the presence or absence of starch\nin the two test tubes?\n/square6What does this tell us about the action of saliva on starch?\nWe eat various types of food which has to pass thr ough the same\ndigestive tract. Naturally the food has to be processed to generate\nparticles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by\ncrushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the\nfood is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something\nwe like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water , but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary\ncanal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the\nhelp of biological catalysts called\nenzymes. The saliva contains an\nenzyme called salivary amylase that\nbreaks down starch which is a complex\nmolecule to give simple sugar . The food\nis mixed thoroughly with saliva and\nmoved around the mouth while\nchewing by the muscular tongue.\nIt is necessary to move the food in\na regulated manner along the digestive\ntube so that it can be processed\nproperly in each part. The lining of\ncanal has muscles that contract\nrhythmically in order to push the food\nforward. These peristaltic movements\noccur all along the gut.\nFrom the mouth, the food is taken\nto the stomach through the food-pipe\nor oesophagus. The stomach is a large\norgan which expands when food\nenters it. The muscular walls of the\nstomach help in mixing the food\nthoroughly with more digestive juices.\nThe digestion in stomach is taken\ncare of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These\nrelease hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin,\nand mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which\nfacilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you\nthink is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the\nstomach fr om the action of the acid under nor mal conditions. W e\nFigure 5.6Figure 5.6Figure 5.6Figure 5.6Figure 5.6  Human alimentary canal\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 86have often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related\nto what has been discussed above?\nThe exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle\nwhich releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier\nto digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.\nThe small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of\ncarbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.\nBile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.\nFats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into\nsmaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar\nto the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in\nChapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains\nenzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down\nemulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which\nsecrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the\nproteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats\ninto fatty acids and glycerol.\nDigested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner\nlining of the small intestine has numer ous finger -like pr ojections called\nvilli which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly\nsupplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and\nevery cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building\nup new tissues and the repair of old tissues.\nThe unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall\nabsorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed\nfrom the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated\nby the anal sphincter .More to Know!Dental caries\nDental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins\nwhen bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel.\nMasses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental\nplaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers\nthe teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria\nproduce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing\ninflammation and infection.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLife Processes 875.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR A AAAATIONTIONTION TIONTION\nActivity 5.4Activity 5.4Activity 5.4Activity 5.4Activity 5.4\n/square6Take some freshly prepared lime\nwater in a test tube.\n/square6Blow air through this lime water .\n/square6Note how long it takes for the lime\nwater to turn milky.\n/square6Use a syringe or pichkari  to pass air\nthrough some fresh lime water\ntaken in another test tube (Fig. 5.7).\n/square6Note how long it takes for this lime\nwater to turn milky.\n/square6What does this tell us about the\namount of carbon dioxide in the air\nthat we breathe out?1.

The\nfood material taken in during the process of nutrition is used in cells to\nprovide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in\ndifferent ways – some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely\ninto carbon dioxide and water , some use other pathways that do not\ninvolve oxygen (Fig. 5.8). In all cases, the first step is the break-down of\nglucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called\npyruvate. This pr ocess takes place in the cytoplasm. Further , the\npyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process\ntakes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place\nin the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Break-\ndown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria. ThisFigure 5.7Figure 5.7Figure 5.7Figure 5.7Figure 5.7\n(a) Air being passed into lime water with a pichkari/\nsyringe,  (b) air being exhaled into lime water\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 88process breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three\nmolecules of carbon dioxide. The other pr oduct is water . Since this\nprocess takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic\nrespiration. The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater\nthan in the anaerobic process. Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen\nin our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is\ntaken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a\nthree-carbon molecule. This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during\nsudden activity causes cramps.\nFigure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8  Break-down of glucose by various pathways\nThe energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used\nto synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other\nactivities in the cell. In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise\nto a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions\ntaking place in the cell.\nATP\nATP is the energy currency for most cellular processes. The energy released during\nthe process of respiration is used to make an ATP molecule from ADP and inorganic\nphosphate.\nEndothermic processes in the cell then use this ATP to drive the reactions. When the\nterminal phosphate linkage in ATP is br oken using water , the ener gy equivalent to\n30.5 kJ/mol is released.\nThink of how a battery can provide energy for many different kinds of uses. It can be\nused to obtain mechanical energy, light energy, electrical energy and so on. Similarly,\nATP can be used in the cells for the contraction of muscles, protein synthesis,\nconduction of nervous impulses and many other activities.\nSince the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic\norganisms need to ensur e that ther e is suf ficient intake of oxygen. W e\nhave seen that plants exchange gases through stomata, and the large\ninter-cellular spaces ensur e that all cells ar e in contact with air . Carbon\ndioxide and oxygen are exchanged by diffusion here. They can go intoMore to Know!\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLife Processes 89cells, or away fr om them and out into the air . The dir ection of dif fusion\ndepends upon the environmental conditions and the requirements of\nthe plant. At night, when there is no photosynthesis occurring, CO2\nelimination is the major exchange activity going on. During the day,\nCO2 generated during respiration is used up for photosynthesis, hence\nthere is no CO2 release. Instead, oxygen release is the major event at\nthis time.\nAnimals have evolved different organs for the uptake of oxygen\nfrom the environment and for getting rid of the carbon dioxide\nproduced. Terrestrial animals can breathe the oxygen in the\natmosphere, but animals that live in water need to use the oxygen\ndissolved in water .\nActivity 5.6Activity 5.6Activity 5.6Activity 5.6Activity 5.6\n/square6Observe fish in an aquarium. They open and close their mouths\nand the gill-slits (or the operculum which covers the gill-slits)\nbehind their eyes also open and close. Are the timings of the\nopening and closing of the mouth and gill-slits coordinated in some\nmanner?\n/square6Count the number of times the fish opens and closes its mouth in\na minute.\n/square6Compare this to the number of times you breathe in and out in a\nminute.\nSince the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared\nto the amount of oxygen in the air , the rate of breathing in aquatic\norganisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms.\nFishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the\ngills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood.\nTerrestrial organisms use the oxygen in the atmosphere for\nrespiration. This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in\ndifferent animals. All these organs have a structure that increases\nthe surface area which is in contact with the oxygen-rich\natmosphere. Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nhas to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine\nand delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed\nwithin the body, so there have to be passages that will take air\nto this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air\nin and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed.\nIn human beings (Fig. 5.9), air is taken into the body through\nthe nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by\nfine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with\nmucus which helps in this process. From here, the air passes\nthrough the throat and into the lungs. Rings of cartilage are\npresent in the thr oat. These ensur e that the air -passage does\nnot collapse.Using tobacco directly or\nany product of tobacco in\nthe for m of cigar , cigar ettes,\nbidis, hookah , gutkha, etc.,\nis harmful. Use of tobacco\nmost commonly affects the\ntongue, lungs, heart and\nliver. Smokeless tobacco is\nalso a major risk factor for\nheart attacks, strokes,\npulmonary diseases and\nseveral forms of cancers.\nThere is a high incidence of\noral cancer in India due to\nthe chewing of tobacco in\nthe form of gutkha . Stay\nhealthy; just say NO to\ntobacco and its products!More to Know!\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 90Within the lungs, the passage divides into smaller and smaller\ntubes which finally terminate in balloon-like structures which\nare called alveoli  (singular–alveolus) . The alveoli provide a surface\nwhere the exchange of gases can take place. The walls of the alveoli\ncontain an extensive network of blood-vessels. As we have seen\nin earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten\nour diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result.\nBecause of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded\nalveoli. The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body\nfor release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is\ntaken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported\nto all the cells in the body. During the breathing cycle, when air is\ntaken in and let out, the lungs always contain a residual volume\nof air so that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed\nand for the carbon dioxide to be released.\nWhen the body size of animals is large,  the diffusion pressure\nalone cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body.\nInstead, respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the\nlungs and carry it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before\nreleasing it. In human beings, the respiratory pigment is\nhaemoglobin which has a very high affinity for oxygen. This pigment\nis present in the red blood corpuscles. Carbon dioxide is more\nsoluble in water than oxygen is and hence is mostly transported in\nthe dissolved form in our blood.\nFigure 5.9Figure 5.9Figure 5.9Figure 5.9Figure 5.9  Human respiratory system\nDo You Know?\nSmoking is injurious to\nhealth.\nLung cancer is one of\ncommon causes of\ndeaths in the world.

In Class IX, we learnt about blood\nbeing a fluid connective tissue. Blood consists of a fluid medium called\nplasma in which the cells are suspended. Plasma transports food, carbon\ndioxide and nitrogenous wastes in dissolved form. Oxygen is carried by\nthe red blood corpuscles. Many other substances like salts, are also\ntransported by the blood. W e thus need a pumping or gan to push blood\naround the body, a network of tubes to reach all the tissues and a system\nin place to ensure that this network can be repaired if damaged.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 92The heart is a muscular organ which is\nas big as our fist (Fig. 5.10). Because\nboth oxygen and carbon dioxide have to\nbe transported by the blood, the heart\nhas different chambers to prevent the\noxygen-rich blood from mixing with the\nblood containing carbon dioxide. The\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach\nthe lungs for the carbon dioxide to be\nremoved, and the oxygenated blood from\nthe lungs has to be brought back to the\nheart. This oxygen-rich blood is then\npumped to the rest of the body.\nWe can follow this pr ocess step by\nstep (Fig. 5.11). Oxygen-rich blood from\nthe lungs comes to the thin-walled upper\nchamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes\nwhen it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber ,\nthe left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the\nmuscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to\nthe body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper\nchamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium\ncontracts, the corr esponding lower chamber , the right ventricle, dilates.\nThis transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the\nlungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various\norgans, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. V alves ensur e\nthat blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.\nOxygen enters the blood in the lungs\nThe separation of the right side and the left side of\nthe heart is useful to keep oxygenated and de-\noxygenated blood from mixing. Such separation\nallows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the\nbody. This is useful in animals that have high\nenergy needs, such as birds and mammals, which\nconstantly use energy to maintain their body\ntemperature. In animals that do not use energy\nfor this purpose, the body temperature depends\non the temperature in the environment. Such\nanimals, like amphibians or  many reptiles have\nthree-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing\nof the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood\nstreams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two\nchambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped\nto the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly\nto the rest of the body. Thus, blood goes only once\nthrough the heart in the fish during one cycle of\npassage through the body. On the other hand, it goes through the heart\ntwice during each cycle in other vertebrates. This is known as double\ncirculation.Our pump — the heart\nFigure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10\nSchematic sectional\nview of the human heart\nFigure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11\nSchematic representation of transport and exchange\nof oxygen and carbon dioxide\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLife Processes 93More to Know!\nBlood pr essur e is measur ed with an instrument called sphygmomanometer . High\nblood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of\narterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow. It can lead to the rupture\nof an artery and internal bleeding.Blood pressure\nThe force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This\npressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the\nartery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure\nin artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal\nsystolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg.\nThe tubes – blood vessels\nArteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various\norgans of the body. Since the blood emerges from the heart under high\npressur e, the arteries have thick, elastic walls. V eins collect the blood\nfrom different organs and bring it back to the heart. They do not need\nthick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure, instead they\nhave valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction.\nOn reaching an organ or tissue, the artery divides into smaller and\nsmaller vessels to bring the blood in contact with all the individual cells.\nThe smallest vessels have walls which are one-cell thick and are called\ncapillaries. Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding\ncells takes place across this thin wall. The capillaries then join together\nto form veins that convey the blood away from the organ or tissue.\nMaintenance by platelets\nWhat happens if this system of tubes develops a leak? Think about\nsituations when we are injured and start bleeding. Naturally the loss of\nblood from the system has to be minimised. In addition, leakage would\nlead to a loss of pressure which would reduce the efficiency of the\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 94pumping system. To avoid this, the blood has platelet cells which circulate\naround the body and plug these leaks by helping to clot the blood at\nthese points of injury.\nLymph\nThere is another type of fluid also involved in transportation. This is\ncalled lymph or tissue fluid. Through the pores present in the walls of\ncapillaries some amount of plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into\nintercellular spaces in the tissues to form the tissue fluid or lymph. It is\nsimilar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein.\nLymph drains into lymphatic capillaries from the inter cellular spaces,\nwhich join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins.\nLymph carries digested and absorbed fat fr om intestine and drains excess\nfluid from extra cellular space back into the blood.\n5.4.2 T ranspor tation in Plants\nWe have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such\nas CO2 and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing\norgans, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots.\nIf the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations.\nEnergy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems\nhave to operate, however , can be very lar ge in plants such as very tall\ntrees.\nPlant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw\nmaterials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as\nindependently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem  moves water\nand minerals obtained fr om the soil. The other , phloem transports\nproducts of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised\nto other parts of the plant. W e have studied the structur e of these tissues\nin detail in Class IX.\nTransport of water\nIn xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are\ninterconnected to for m a continuous system of water -conducting\nchannels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact\nwith the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the\nconcentration of these ions between the r oot and the soil. W ater, therefore,\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLife Processes 95moves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference. This means\nthat there is steady movement of water into root xylem, creating a column\nof water that is steadily pushed upwards.\nHowever , this pr essur e by itself is unlikely to be enough to move\nwater over the heights that we commonly see in plants. Plants use another\nstrategy to move water in the xylem upwards to the highest points of the\nplant body.\nActivity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8\n/square6Take two small pots of approximately the same size and having\nthe same amount of soil. One should have a plant in it. Place a\nstick of the same height as the plant in the other pot.\n/square6Cover the soil in both pots with a plastic sheet so that moisture\ncannot escape by evaporation.\n/square6Cover both sets, one with the plant and the other with the stick,\nwith plastic sheets and place in bright sunlight for half an hour .\n/square6Do you observe any difference in the two cases?\nProvided that the plant has an adequate\nsupply of water , the water which is lost thr ough the\nstomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels\nin the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from\nthe cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water\nfrom the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the\nform of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is\nknown as transpiration.\nThus, transpiration helps in the absorption and\nupward movement of water and minerals dissolved\nin it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in\ntemperature regulation.  The effect of root pressure in\ntransport of water is more important at night. During\nthe day when the stomata are open, the transpiration\npull becomes the major driving force in the movement\nof water in the xylem.\nTransport of food and other substances\nSo far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants.\nNow let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly\nphotosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other\nparts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis\nis called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue\nknown as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances. These substances are\nespecially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and\nto growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes\nplace in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both\nin upward and downward directions.\nUnlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple\nphysical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising\nFigure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12\nMovement of water during transpiration in a tree\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 96energy. Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using\nenergy from A TP. This incr eases the osmotic pr essur e of the tissue\ncausing water to move into it. This pressure moves the material in the\nphloem to tissues which have less pressure. This allows the phloem to\nmove material according to the plant’s needs. For example, in the spring,\nsugar stored in root or stem tissue would be transported to the buds\nwhich need energy to grow.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What are the components of the transport system in human beings?\nWhat are the functions of these components?\n2. Why is it necessary to separate oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in\nmammals and birds?\n3. What are the components of the transport system in highly organised\nplants?\n4. How are water and minerals transported in plants?\n5. How is food transported in plants?\n5.5 EX5.5 EX5.5 EX5.5 EX5.5 EX CRETION\nCRETIONCRETION CRETIONCRETION\nWe have alr eady discussed how or ganisms get rid of gaseous wastes\ngenerated during photosynthesis or respiration. Other metabolic activities\ngenerate nitrogenous materials which need to be removed. The biological\nprocess involved in the removal of these harmful metabolic wastes from\nthe body is called excretion. Different organisms use varied strategies to\ndo this. Many unicellular organisms remove these wastes by simple\ndiffusion from the body surface into the surrounding\nwater . As we have seen in other processes, complex\nmulti-cellular organisms use specialised organs to\nperform the same function.\n5.5.1 Excretion in Human Beings\nThe excretory system of human beings (Fig. 5.13)\nincludes a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary\nbladder and a urethra. Kidneys are located in the\nabdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine\nproduced in the kidneys passes through the ureters\ninto the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is\nreleased through the urethra.\nHow is urine produced? The purpose of making\nurine is to filter out waste products from the blood.\nJust as CO2 is removed from the blood in the lungs,\nnitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are\nremoved from blood in the kidneys. It is then no\nsurprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys,\nFigure 5.13\nExcretory system in human beings\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLife Processes 97like in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood\ncapillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is\nassociated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube\ncalled Bowman’s capsule that collects the filtrate\n (Fig. 5.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these\nfiltration units called nephr ons packed close together .\nSome substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,\namino acids, salts and a major amount of water , are\nselectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube.\nThe amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much\nexcess water there is in the body, and on how much of\ndissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming\nin each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ur eter,\nwhich connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder .\nUrine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure\nof the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out\nthrough the ur ethra. The bladder is muscular , so it is\nunder nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere.\nAs a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.\nMore to Know!Artificial kidney (Hemodialysis)\nKidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted\nblood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of\npoisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney\nfailure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove\nnitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.\nArtificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended\nin a tank filled with dialysing fluid.\nThis fluid has the same osmotic\npressure as blood, except that it is\ndevoid of nitrogenous wastes. The\npatient’s blood is passed through\nthese tubes. During this passage,\nthe waste products from the blood\npass into dialysing fluid by diffusion.\nThe purified blood is pumped back\ninto the patient. This is similar to the\nfunction of the kidney, but it is\ndifferent since there is no re-\nabsorption involved. Normally, in a\nhealthy adult, the initial filtrate in the\nkidneys is about 180 L daily.\nHowever , the volume actually\nexcreted is only a litre or two a day,\nbecause the remaining filtrate is re-\nabsorbed in the kidney tubules.\nFigure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14\nStructure of a nephron\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 985.5.2 Excretion in Plants\nPlants use completely different\nstrategies for excretion than those\nof animals. Oxygen itself can be\nthought of as a waste product\ngenerated during photosynthesis!\nWe have discussed earlier how\nplants deal with oxygen as well as\nCO2. They can get rid of excess water\nby transpiration. For other wastes,\nplants use the fact that many of\ntheir tissues consist of dead cells,\nand that they can even lose some\nparts such as leaves. Many plant\nwaste products are stored in\ncellular vacuoles. W aste products\nmay be stored in leaves that fall off.\nOther waste products are stored as\nresins and gums, especially in old\nxylem. Plants also excrete some\nwaste substances into the soil\naround them.\nWhat y ou hav e learnt\n/square6Movement of various types can be taken as an indication of life.\n/square6Maintenance of life requires processes like nutrition, respiration, transport of\nmaterials within the body and excretion of waste products.\n/square6Autotrophic nutrition involves the intake of simple inorganic materials from the\nenvironment and using an external energy source like the Sun to synthesise complex\nhigh-energy organic material.\n/square6Heterotrophic nutrition involves the intake of complex material prepared by other\norganisms.\n/square6In human beings, the food eaten is broken down by various steps along the\nalimentary canal and the digested food is absorbed in the small intestine to be sent\nto all cells in the body.Think it over!\nOrgan donation\nOrgan donation is a generous act of donating an\norgan to a person who suffers from non-function of\norgan(s). Donation of an organ may be done by the\nconsent of the donor and his/her family. Anyone\nregardless of age or gender can become an organ\nand tissue donor . Organ transplants can save or\ntransfor m the life of a person. T ransplantation is\nrequired because recipient’s organ has been\ndamaged or has failed by disease or injury. In organ\ntransplantation the organ is surgically removed\nfrom one person (organ donor) and transplanted to\nanother person (the recipient). Common\ntransplantations include corneas, kidneys, heart,\nliver, pancr eas, lungs, intestines and bone marr ow.\nMost organ and tissue donations occur just after\nthe donor has died or when the doctor declares a\nperson brain dead. But some organs such as\nkidney, part of a liver , lung, etc., and tissues can be\ndonated while the donor is alive.\n?QUESTIONS\n1. Describe the structure and functioning of nephrons.\n2.

{"class": "10", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 6: control and coordination", "content": "Science 100Control and\nCoordination6 CHAPTER\nIn the pr evious chapter , we looked at life processes involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better . When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper ,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n6.16.16.1\n6.16.1ANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied  in Class IX. Touching a hot\nReprint 2025-26\n\nControl and Coordination 101object is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. W e need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear , the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)],  sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses fr om one part of the body to another .\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmi ssion.\nActivity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1\n/square6Put some sugar in your mouth.

If so, why might this be happening? Read and talk about\npossible explanations for these kinds of differences. Do you come across\na similar situation when you have a cold?\nFigure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 (a) Structure of neuron, (b)      Neuromuscular\njunction(a)\n(b)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 1026.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions?\n‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden\naction in response to something in the envir onment. W e say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our r eactions. Y et these ar e situations wher e we ar e responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\nLet us consider this further . Take one of our examples. T ouching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If\nnerve impulses ar e sent ar ound the way we have talked about earlier ,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other . Nerves fr om all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought pr ocesses.  However , even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nControl and Coordination 103Can you now trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright\nlight is focussed on your eyes?\n6.1.2 Human Brain\nIs reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\nWe also think about our actions. W riting, talking, moving a chair,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next.  So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles.  The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain.  Based onFigure 6.2 Figure 6.2 Figure 6.2 Figure 6.2 Figure 6.2 Reflex arc\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 104all this, a decision is made about how to respond and the information is\npassed on to the motor areas which control the movement of voluntary\nmuscles, for example, our leg muscles.  However , certain sensations ar e\ndistinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we\nhave eaten enough? The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre\nassociated with  hunger , which is in a separate part of the for e-brain.\nStudy the labelled diagram of the human brain. W e have seen that\nthe different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function\nof each part?\nLet us look at the other use of the word ‘reflex’ that we have talked\nabout in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like\nwithout our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it.\nIn fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them\neven if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe\nor digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in\nthe size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a\nchair , ther e is another set of muscle movements over which we do not\nhave any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are\ncontrolled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions\nincluding blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the\nmedulla in the hind-brain.\nThink about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle,\npicking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain\ncalled the cerebellum. It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions\nand maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what\nwould happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not\nthinking about it.Figure 6.3Figure 6.3Figure 6.3Figure 6.3Figure 6.3  Human brain\nReprint 2025-26\n\nControl and Coordination 1056.1.3 How are these Tissues protected?\nA delicate organ like the brain, which is so important for a variety of\nactivities, needs to be carefully protected. For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\nSo far , we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far , what\ndo you think the differences between these would be?\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What is the difference between a reflex action and walking?\n2. What happens at the synapse between two neurons?\n3. Which part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body?\n4. How do we detect the smell of an agarbatti (incense stick)?\n5. What is the role of the brain in reflex action?\n6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA TION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PL ANTS ANTSANTSANTSANTS\nAnimals have a nervous system for controlling and coordinating the\nactivities of the body. But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui  (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air . What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 106There is no growth involved in this movement. On the other hand, the\ndirectional movement of a seedling is caused by growth. If it is prevented\nfrom growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different\ntypes of movement – one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth.\n6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response?\nFigure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4  The sensitive plant\nIf we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part\nof the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a\npoint different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.\nFinally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4).\n6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object.\nThis causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it.\nMore commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nControl and Coordination 107Environmental triggers such as light, or gravity\nwill change the directions that plant parts grow in.\nThese directional, or tropic, movements can be either\ntowards the stimulus, or away from it. So, in two\ndifferent kinds of phototropic movement, shoots\nrespond by bending towards light while roots\nrespond by bending away from it. How does this help\nthe plant?\nPlants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots\nof a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow\nupwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’\nrefers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’\nmean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms.\nLet us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow.\nGrowth-r elated movement of plants will be even slower .\nEven in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly.\nSo controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to\nstimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly.\nFor this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2\n/square6Fill a conical flask with water .\n/square6Cover the neck of the flask with a wire mesh.\n/square6Keep two or three freshly germinated bean\nseeds on the wire mesh.\n/square6Take a cardboard box which is open from one\nside.\n/square6Keep the flask in the box in such a manner\nthat the open side of the box faces light coming\nfrom a window (Fig. 6.5).\n/square6After two or three days, you will notice that\nthe shoots bend towards light and roots away\nfrom light.\n/square6Now turn the flask so that the shoots are away\nfrom light and the roots towards light.

But there are\nlimitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication.\nIf, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound\nusing special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to\nrecognise infor mation, and even transmit it. This will be slower , of course,\nbut it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous\nconnections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These\ncompounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control\nand coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect.\nDifferent plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action.\nLet us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2].\nWhen growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to gr ow longer . When light is coming fr om\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.\nThis concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light.\nAnother example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples\nof plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need\nsignals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which\ninhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What are plant hormones?\n2. How is the movement of leaves of the sensitive plant different from the\nmovement of a shoot towards light?\n3.

What do some animals, for instance squirrels,\nexperience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to\nprepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated\nactivities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many\ndifferent tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together\nin these actions. However , the two alter nate activities, fighting or running,\nare also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common\npreparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved?\nIf the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.\nAdrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different\nparts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it\nacts include the heart. As a r esult, the heart beats faster , resulting in\nsupply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system\nand skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries\nin these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The\nbreathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the\ndiaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the\nanimal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones\nare part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control\nand coordination in our body.\nActivity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3\n/square6Look at Fig. 6.7.\n/square6Identify the endocrine glands mentioned in the figure.\n/square6Some of these glands have been listed in Table 6.1 and discussed\nin the text. Consult books in the library and discuss with your\nteachers to find out about other glands.\nRemember that plants have hormones that control their directional\ngrowth. What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it,\nwe cannot imagine their r ole in dir ectional gr owth. W e have never seen\nan animal growing mor e in one dir ection or the other , depending on\nlight or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident\nthat, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places.\nPlants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example.\nBut we do not grow fingers on our faces. The design of the body is carefully\nmaintained even during the growth of children.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 110Let us examine some examples to understand how hormones help\nin coordinated growth. We have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised\nsalt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised\nsalt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make\nthyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat\nmetabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth.\nIodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient\nin our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One\nof the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck. Can you correlate\nthis with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 6.7?\nSometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs)\nor extremely tall (giants). Have you ever wondered how this happens?\nGrowth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As\nits name indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development\nof the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it\nleads to dwarfism.\nYou must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance\nas well as that of your friends as you approached 10–12 years of age.\nThese changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of\ntestosterone in males and oestrogen in females.\nDo you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised\nby the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering\nfrom diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin.\nThis is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in\nregulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts,\nthe sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects.Figure 6.7 Endocrine glands in human beings (a) male, (b) female(a) (b)\nDo You Know?\nHypothalamus plays\nan important role in\nthe release of many\nhormones. For\nexample, when the\nlevel of growth\nhormone is low, the\nhypothalamus\nreleases growth\nhormone releasing\nfactor which\nstimulates the\npituitary gland to\nrelease growth\nhormone.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nControl and Coordination 111If it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise\nquantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing\nand amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms.\nFor example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the\ncells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the\nblood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.\nTable 6.1 : Some important hormones and their functionsActivity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4\n/square6  Hormones are secreted by endocrine glands and have specific functions.

{"class": "10", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 7: how do organisms reproduce", "content": "How do Organisms\nReproduce ?7 CHAPTER\nBefore we discuss the mechanisms by which organisms reproduce,\nlet us ask a more basic question – why do organisms reproduce?\nAfter all, reproduction is not necessary to maintain the life of an individual\norganism, unlike the essential life processes such as nutrition,\nrespiration, or excretion. On the other hand, if an individual organism is\ngoing to create more individuals, a lot of its energy will be spent in the\nprocess. So why should an individual organism waste energy on a process\nit does not need to stay alive? It would be interesting to discuss the\npossible answers in the classroom!\nWhatever the answer to this question, it is obvious that we notice\norganisms because they reproduce. If there were to be only one, non-\nreproducing member of a particular kind, it is doubtful that we would\nhave noticed its existence. It is the large numbers of organisms belonging\nto a single species that bring them to our notice. How do we know that\ntwo different individual organisms belong to the same species? Usually,\nwe say this because they look similar to each other . Thus, r eproducing\norganisms create new individuals that look very much like themselves.\n7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG ANISMS CREAANISMS CREAANISMS CREAANISMS CREAANISMS CREA TE EXATE EXATE EXATE EXATE EXA CT COPIES OFCT COPIES OFCT COPIES OFCT COPIES OFCT COPIES OF\nTHEMSEL\nTHEMSELTHEMSEL THEMSELTHEMSEL VES? VES?VES? VES?VES?\nOrganisms look similar because their body designs are similar . If body\ndesigns are to be similar , the blueprints for these designs should be\nsimilar . Thus, repr oduction at its most basic level will involve making\ncopies of the blueprints of body design. In Class IX, we learnt that the\nchromosomes in the nucleus of a cell contain information for inheritance\nof features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information\nsource for making proteins. If the information is changed, different\nproteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered\nbody designs.\nTherefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA\ncopy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This\ncreates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to\nbe separated fr om each other . However , keeping one copy of DNA in the\noriginal cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work,\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 114?because the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular\nstructure for maintaining life processes. Therefore, DNA copying is\naccompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus, and\nthen the DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus.\nEffectively, a cell divides to give rise to two cells.\nThese two cells ar e of course similar , but ar e they likely to be\nabsolutely identical? The answer to this question will depend on how\naccurately the copying r eactions involved occur . No bio-chemical r eaction\nis absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process\nof copying the DNA will have some variations each time. As a result, the\nDNA copies generated will be similar , but may not be identical to the\noriginal. Some of these variations might be so drastic that the new DNA\ncopy cannot work with the cellular apparatus it inherits. Such a newborn\ncell will simply die. On the other hand, there could still be many other\nvariations in the DNA copies that would not lead to such a drastic\noutcome. Thus, the surviving cells are similar to, but subtly different\nfrom each other . This inbuilt tendency for variation during r eproduction\nis the basis for evolution, as we will discuss in the next chapter .\n7.1.1 The Impor tance of V ariation\nPopulations of organisms fill well-defined places, or niches, in the\necosystem, using their ability to reproduce. The consistency of DNA\ncopying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body\ndesign features that allow the organism to use that particular niche.\nReproduction is therefore linked to the stability of populations of species.\nHowever , niches can change because of r easons beyond the contr ol\nof the organisms. Temperatures on earth can go up or down, water levels\ncan vary, or there could be meteorite hits, to think of a few examples. If\na population of reproducing organisms were suited to a particular niche\nand if the niche were drastically altered, the population could be wiped\nout. However , if some variations wer e to be pr esent in a few individuals\nin these populations, there would be some chance for them to survive.\nThus, if there were a population of bacteria living in temperate waters,\nand if the water temperature were to be increased by global warming,\nmost of these bacteria would die, but the few variants resistant to heat\nwould survive and gr ow further . Variation is thus useful for the survival\nof species over time.\nQUESTIONS\n1. What is the importance of DNA copying in reproduction?\n2. Why is variation beneficial to the species but not necessarily\nfor the individual?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 115\nFigure 7.1(a)Figure 7.1(a)Figure 7.1(a)Figure 7.1(a)Figure 7.1(a)  Binary fission in AmoebaActivity 7.2Activity 7.2Activity 7.2Activity 7.2Activity 7.27.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE\nORGANISMSORGANISMSORGANISMSORGANISMSORGANISMS\nActivity 7.1Activity 7.1Activity 7.1Activity 7.1Activity 7.1\n/square6Dissolve about 10 gm of sugar in 100 mL of water .\n/square6Take 20 mL of this solution in a test tube and add a pinch of yeast\ngranules to it.\n/square6Put a cotton plug on the mouth of the test tube and keep it in a\nwarm place.\n/square6After 1 or 2 hours, put a small drop of yeast culture from the test\ntube on a slide and cover it with a coverslip.\n/square6Observe the slide under a microscope.\n/square6Wet a slice of br ead, and keep it in a cool, moist and dark place.\n/square6Observe the surface of the slice with a magnifying glass.\n/square6Record your observations for a week.\nCompare and contrast the ways in which yeast grows in the first\ncase, and how mould grows in the second.\nHaving discussed the context in which reproductive processes work,\nlet us now examine how different organisms actually reproduce. The\nmodes by which various organisms reproduce depend on the body\ndesign of the organisms.\n7.2.1 Fission\nFor unicellular organisms, cell division, or fission, leads to the creation\nof new individuals. Many different patterns of fission have been observed.\nMany bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during\ncell division. In organisms such as Amoeba , the splitting of the two cells\nduring division can take place in any plane.\nActivity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3\n/square6Observe a permanent slide of\nAmoeba  under a microscope.\n/square6Similarly observe another\npermanent slide of Amoeba\nshowing binary fission.\n/square6Now, compare the observations of\nboth the slides.\nHowever , some unicellular organisms\nshow somewhat more organisation of their\nbodies, such as is seen in Leishmania  (which\ncause kala-azar ), which have a whip-like\nstructure at one end of the cell. In such\norganisms, binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation toFigure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)  Binary fission in Leishmania  (a)         (b)          (c)          (d)            (e)                        (f)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 116these structures. Other single-celled organisms, such as the malarial\nparasite, Plasmodium , divide into many daughter cells simultaneously\nby multiple fission.\nYeast, on the other hand, can put out small buds that separate and\ngrow further , as we saw in Activity 7.1.\n7.2.2 Fragmentation\nFigure 7.2Figure 7.2Figure 7.2Figure 7.2Figure 7.2\nMultiple fission in\nPlasmodium Activity 7.4Activity 7.4Activity 7.4Activity 7.4Activity 7.4\n/square6Collect water from a lake or pond that appears dark green and\ncontains filamentous structures.\n/square6Put one or two filaments on a slide.\n/square6Put a drop of glycerine on these filaments and cover it with a coverslip.\n/square6Observe the slide under a microscope.\n/square6Can you identify different tissues in the Spirogyra  filaments?\nIn multi-cellular organisms with relatively simple body organisation,\nsimple reproductive methods can still work. Spirogyra , for example,\nsimply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation. These pieces or\nfragments grow into new individuals. Can we work out the reason for\nthis, based on what we saw in Activity 7.4?\nThis is not true for all multi-cellular organisms. They cannot simply\ndivide cell-by-cell. The reason is that many multi-cellular organisms, as\nwe have seen, are not simply a random collection of cells. Specialised\ncells are organised as tissues, and tissues are organised into organs,\nwhich then have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In such a\ncarefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical.\nMulti-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of\nreproduction.\nA basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different\ncell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general\npattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific\ncell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if\nthe organism itself consists of many cell types? The answer is that there\nmust be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing,\nproliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances.\n7.2.3 Regeneration\nMany fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new\nindividual organisms from their body parts. That is, if the individual is\nsomehow cut or broken up into many pieces, many of these pieces grow\ninto separate individuals. For example, simple animals like Hydra  and\nPlanaria  can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows\ninto a complete organism. This is known as regeneration (see Fig. 7.3).\nRegeneration is carried out by specialised cells. These cells proliferate\nand make large numbers of cells. From this mass of cells, different cells\nundergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. These changes\nReprint 2025-26\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 117\nFigure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Regeneration in Planariatake place in an organised\nsequence referred to as\ndevelopment. However ,\nregeneration is not the same\nas reproduction, since most\norganisms would not\nnormally depend on being cut\nup to be able to reproduce.\n7.2.4 Budding\nOrganisms such as Hydra\nuse regenerative cells for\nreproduction in the process of\nbudding. In Hydra , a bud\ndevelops as an outgrowth due\nto repeated cell division at one\nspecific site (Fig. 7.4). These buds develop into tiny individuals and when\nfully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent\nindividuals.\nFigure 7.4Figure 7.4Figure 7.4Figure 7.4Figure 7.4  Budding in Hydra\n7.2.5 V egetative Propagation\nThere are many plants in which parts like the root, stem and leaves\ndevelop into new plants under appropriate conditions. Unlike in most\nanimals, plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction. This\nproperty of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering\nor grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for\nagricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear\nflowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods\nalso make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange,\nrose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another\nadvantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are\ngenetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its\ncharacteristics.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 118Similarly buds produced in the notches along the leaf\nmargin of Bryophyllum  fall on the soil and develop into\nnew plants (Fig. 7.5).\nActivity 7.6Activity 7.6Activity 7.6Activity 7.6Activity 7.6\n/square6Select a money-plant.\n/square6Cut some pieces such that they contain at least\none leaf.\n/square6Cut out some other portions between two leaves.\n/square6Dip one end of all the pieces in water and observe\nover the next few days.\n/square6Which ones grow and give rise to fresh leaves?\n/square6What can you conclude from your observations?\nTissue cultur e\nIn tissue culture, new plants are grown by removing tissue or separating cells from\nthe growing tip of a plant. The cells are then placed in an artificial medium where they\ndivide rapidly to form a small group of cells or callus. The callus is transferred to\nanother medium containing hormones for growth and differentiation. The plantlets\nare then placed in the soil so that they can grow into mature plants. Using tissue\nculture, many plants can be grown from one parent in disease-free conditions. This\ntechnique is commonly used for ornamental plants.\n7.2.6 Spore F ormation\nEven in many simple multi-cellular organisms, specific reproductive\nparts can be identified. The thread-like structures that developed on\nthe bread in Activity 7.2 above are the hyphae of the bread mould\n(Rhizopus ). They are not reproductive parts. On the other hand, the\ntiny blob-on-a-stick structures are involved in reproduction. The\nblobs are sporangia, which contain cells, or spores, that can\neventually develop into new Rhizopus  individuals (Fig. 7.6). The spores\nare covered by thick walls that protect them until they come into\ncontact with another moist surface and can begin to grow.Figure 7.6Figure 7.6Figure 7.6Figure 7.6Figure 7.6\nSpore formation in RhizopusActivity 7.5Activity 7.5Activity 7.5Activity 7.5Activity 7.5\n/square6Take a potato and observe its surface.

This is known as\nasexual reproduction.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. How does binary fission differ from multiple fission?\n2. How will an organism be benefited if it reproduces through spores?\n3. Can you think of reasons why more complex organisms cannot give\nrise to new individuals through regeneration?\n4. Why is vegetative propagation practised for growing some types of\nplants?\n5. Why is DNA copying an essential part of the process of reproduction?\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\nWe are also familiar with modes of r eproduction that depend on the\ninvolvement of two individuals before a new generation can be created.\nBulls alone cannot produce new calves, nor can hens alone produce\nnew chicks. In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to\nproduce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode\nof reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of\nreproduction, which we have been discussing above?\n7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction?\nThe creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as\nwell as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we\nhave noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are\na source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual\norganism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,\nvariations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would\ntherefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes\nthat allowed more and more variation to be generated.\nWhile DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they\nare precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow\nprocess. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many\nof the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular\napparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants\nbe speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already\nhas variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two\ndifferent individuals in a population would have quite different patterns\nof accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living\nindividuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects.\nCombining variations from two or more individuals would thus create\nnew combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since\nit would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 120reproduction incorporates such a process of combining DNA from two\ndifferent individuals during reproduction.\nBut this creates a major difficulty. If each new generation is to be the\ncombination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then\neach new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that\nthe previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the\ncellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for\nsolving this difficulty?\nWe have seen earlier that as organisms become mor e complex, the\nspecialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular\norganisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special\nlineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of\nchromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-\nreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division\ncalled meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine\nduring sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-\nestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in\nthe new generation.\nIf the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has\nhighly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores\nof energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two\ngerm-cells ar e not very dif fer\nent fr om one another , or may even be similar .\nBut as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also\nspecialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the\nother is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-\ncell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored\nfood is called the female gamete. W e shall see in the next few sections\nhow the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to\ndifferences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some\ncases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms.\n7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\nThe r eproductive parts of angiosper ms ar e located in the flower . You\nhave already studied the different parts of a flower – sepals, petals,\nstamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are\nthe reproductive parts of a flower which\ncontain the germ-cells.  What possible\nfunctions could the petals and sepals serve?\nThe flower may be unisexual (papaya,\nwatermelon) when it contains either stamens\nor pistil or bisexual ( Hibiscus , mustard)\nwhen it contains both stamens and pistil.\nStamen is the male reproductive part and it\nproduces pollen grains that are yellowish\nin colour . You must have seen this yellowish\npowder that often sticks to our hands if we\ntouch the stamen of a flower . Pistil is pr esent\nin the centre of a flower and is the female\nreproductive part. It is made of three parts.\nFigure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7\nLongitudinal section of\nflower\nReprint 2025-26\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 121\nFigure 7.8Figure 7.8Figure 7.8Figure 7.8Figure 7.8\nGermination of pollen on\nstigmaThe swollen bottom part is the ovary, middle elongated part is the style\nand the terminal part which may be sticky is the stigma. The ovary\ncontains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell\nproduced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in\nthe ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the\nzygote which is capable of growing into a new plant.\nThus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the\nstigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower , it is\nreferred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is\ntransferr ed fr om one flower to another , it is known as cr oss-\npollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is\nachieved by agents like wind, water or animals.\nAfter the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the\nfemale germ-cells which are in the ovary. For this, a tube grows\nout of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the\novary.\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote divides several times to form an\nembryo within the ovule. The ovule develops a tough coat and is\ngradually converted into a seed. The ovary grows rapidly and ripens\nto form a fruit. Meanwhile, the petals, sepals, stamens, style and\nstigma may shrivel and fall off. Have you ever observed any flower\npart still persisting in the fruit? T ry and work out the advantages\nof seed-formation for the plant. The seed contains the future plant\nor embryo which develops into a seedling under appropriate\nconditions. This process is known as germination.\nActivity 7.7Activity 7.7Activity 7.7Activity 7.7Activity 7.7\n/square6Soak a few seeds of Bengal gram ( chana )\nand keep them overnight.\n/square6Drain the excess water and cover the seeds\nwith a wet cloth and leave them for a day.\nMake sure that the seeds do not become dry.\n/square6Cut open the seeds carefully and observe\nthe different parts.\n/square6Compare your observations with the Fig. 7.9\nand see if you can identify all the parts.\n7.3.3 Reproduction in Human Beings\nSo far , we have been discussing the variety of modes that dif ferent species\nuse for reproduction. Let us now look at the species that we are most\ninterested in, namely, humans. Humans use a sexual mode of\nreproduction. How does this process work?\nLet us begin at an apparently unrelated point. All of us know that\nour bodies change as we become older . You have lear nt changes that\ntake place in your body earlier in Class VIII also. W e notice that our\nheight has incr eased continuously fr om early age till now. W e acquir e\nteeth, we even lose the old, so-called milk teeth and acquire new ones.\nFigure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9\nGermination\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 122All of these are changes that can be grouped under the general process\nof growth, in which the body becomes lar ger. But in early teenage years,\na whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as\nbody enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes.\nProportions change, new featur es appear , and so do new sensations.\nSome of these changes ar e common to both boys and girls. W e begin\nto notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits\nand the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker\nin colour . Thinner hair can also appear on legs and ar ms, as well as on\nthe face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop\npimples. W e begin to be conscious and awar e of both our own bodies\nand those of others in new ways.\nOn the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are\ndifferent between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,\nwith darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,\ngirls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new\nthick hair gr owth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further ,\nthe penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in\ndaydreams or at night.\nAll of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and\nyears. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do\nthey happen at an exact age. In some people, they happen early and\nquickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does\nnot become complete quickly either . So, for example, thick hair on the\nface in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does\nthe growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show\ndifferences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or\nfingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and\nshape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual\nmaturation of the body.\nWhy does the body show sexual maturation at this age? W e have\ntalked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies\nto carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate\nin sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen\nthat plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human\nbeings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However , while the\nbody of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources\nof the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is\nhappening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be\na major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow\ndown, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during\nadolescence is called puberty.\nSo how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the\nreproductive pr ocess? W e must r emember that the sexual mode of\nreproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join\ntogether . This can happen by the exter nal release of ger m-cells fr om the\nbodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants. Or it can happen\nby two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of\ngerm-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to\nReprint 2025-26\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 123participate in this process of mating, their state of sexual maturity must\nbe identifiable by other individuals. Many changes during puberty, such\nas new hair -growth patter ns, ar e signals that sexual maturation is taking\nplace.\nOn the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two\npeople needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it\nis capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is\ncarried in the mother’s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed\nlater. The female r eproductive or gans and br easts will need to matur e to\naccommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in\nthe process of sexual reproduction.\n7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System\nThe male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)\nconsists of portions which produce the\ngerm-cells and other portions that deliver\nthe germ-cells to the site of fertilisation.\nThe formation of germ-cells or sperms\ntakes place in the testes. These are located\noutside the abdominal cavity in scrotum\nbecause sperm formation requires a lower\ntemperature than the normal body\ntemperatur e. We have discussed the r ole of the\ntestes in the secretion of the hormone,\ntestoster one, in the pr evious chapter . In\naddition to regulating the formation of sperms,\ntestosterone brings about changes in\nappearance seen in boys at the time of puberty.\nThe sperms formed are delivered\nthrough the vas deferens which unites with\na tube coming fr om the urinary bladder . The\nurethra thus forms a common passage for\nboth the sperms and urine. Along the path\nof the vas deferens, glands like the prostate\nand the seminal vesicles add their secretions\nso that the sperms are now in a fluid which\nmakes their transport easier and this fluid\nalso provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny\nbodies that consist of mainly genetic\nmaterial and a long tail that helps them to\nmove towards the female germ-cell.\n7.3.3 (b) Female Reproductive System\nThe female germ-cells or eggs are made in\nthe ovaries. They are also responsible for the\nproduction of some hormones. Look at\nFig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in\nthe female reproductive system.\nFigure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Huma n–male reproductive system\nFigure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Huma n–female reproductive system\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 124When a girl is born, the ovaries already contain thousands of\nimmature eggs. On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One\negg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried\nfrom the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube.\nThe two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the\nuterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix.\nThe sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual\nintercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may\nencounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a\nball of cells or embryo. The embryo i s implanted in the li ning of the uterus\nwhere they continue to gr ow and develop or gans to become foetus. W e\nhave seen in earlier sections that the mother’s body is designed to\nundertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself\nevery month to receive and nurture the growing embryo. The lining\nthickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo.\nThe embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a\nspecial tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the\nuterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the\nmother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides\na large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to\nthe embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances\nwhich can be removed by transferring them into the mother’s blood\nthrough the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother’s\nbody takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus.\n7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not F ertilised?\nIf the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary\nreleases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month\nto receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy.\nThis would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had\ntaken place. Now, however , this lining is not needed any longer . So, the\nlining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and\nmucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as\nmenstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days.\n7.3.3 (d) Reproductive Health\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes\nplace while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree\nof sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the\nmind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children.\nHow do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major\nresponsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures\nabout these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for\nparticipating in many activities, whether we really want to or not. There\ncan be pressure from families to get married and start having children.\nThere can be pressure from government agencies to avoid having\nchildren. In this situation, making choices can become very difficult.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 125We must also consider the possible health consequences of having\nsex. W e have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted\nfrom person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a\nvery intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many\ndiseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections\nsuch as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts\nand HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases\nduring the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis\nduring sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to\nsome extent.\nThe sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy.\nPregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the\nwoman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely\naffected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy.\nThese contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One\ncategory is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not\nreach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the\nvagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts\nby changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not\nreleased and fertilisation cannot occur . These drugs commonly need\nto be taken orally as pills. However , since they change hor monal\nbalances, they can cause side -effects too. Other contraceptive devices\nsuch as the loop or the copper -T are placed in the uterus to pr event\npregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the\nuterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will\nbe prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will\nnot be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take\nplace. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While\nsurgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause\ninfections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can\nalso be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be\nmisused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in\nillegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,\nthe female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless\nfemale foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in\nsome sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has\nbeen prohibited by law.\nWe have noted earlier that repr oduction is the pr ocess by which\norganisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a\ngiven population will determine its size. The size of the human population\nis a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding\npopulation makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living.\nHowever , if inequality in society is the main r eason for poor standar ds of\nliving for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant.\nIf we look around us, what can we identify as the most important\nreason(s) for poor living standards?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 126What y ou hav e learnt\n/square6Reproduction, unlike other life processes, is not essential to maintain the life of an\nindividual organism.\n/square6Reproduction involves creation of a DNA copy and additional cellular apparatus\nby the cell involved in the process.\n/square6Various or ganisms use dif ferent modes of r eproduction depending on their body\ndesign.\n/square6In fission, many bacteria and protozoa simply divide into two or more daughter\ncells.\n/square6Organisms such as hydra can regenerate if they are broken into pieces.

The rules of heredity determine\nthe process by which traits and characteristics are reliably inherited. Let\nus take a closer look at these rules.\n8.2.1 Inherited T raits\nWhat exactly do we mean by similarities and dif ferences? W e know that\na child bears all the basic featur es of a human being.

Based on\nthis evidence, suggest a possible rule for the inheritance of earlobe\ntypes.\n8.2.2 Rules for the Inheritance of T raits – –– ––\nMendel’s Contributions\nThe rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to\nthe fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal\namounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can\nbe influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait\nthere will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in\nthe child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such\ninheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from\nmore than a century ago.Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2\n(a) Free and (b) attached\nearlobes. The lowest part\nof the ear , called the\nearlobe, is closely attached\nto the side of the head in\nsome of us, and not\nin others. Free and\nattached earlobes are two\nvariants found in human\npopulations.different kinds of advantages. Bacteria that can withstand heat will survive\nbetter in a heat wave, as we have discussed earlier . Selection of variants\nby environmental factors forms the basis for evolutionary processes, as\nwe will discuss in later sections.\n(a)\n(b)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 130Mendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden\npeas – round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and\nso on.  He took pea plants with different characteristics – a tall plant and\na short plant, produced progeny by crossing them, and calculated the\npercentages of tall or short progeny.\nIn the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this first-\ngeneration, or F1 progeny – no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were\ntall. This meant that only one of the parental traits\nwas seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next\nquestion was, were the tall plants in the F1\ngeneration exactly the same as the tall plants of the\nparent generation? Mendelian experiments test this\nby getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall\nplants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny\nof the par ental plants ar e, of course, all tall. However ,\nthe second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall\nplants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them\nare short. This indicates that both the tallness and\nshortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but\nonly the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel\nto propose that two copies of factor (now called genes)\ncontrolling traits are present in sexually reproducing\norganism. These two may be identical, or may be\ndifferent, depending on the parentage. A pattern of\ninheritance can be worked out with this assumption,\nas shown in Fig. 8.3.Gregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884)\nMendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and\nmathematics at the University of Vienna. Failure in the examinations for a\nteaching certificate did not suppress his zeal for scientific quest. He went\nback to his monastery and started growing peas. Many others had studied\nthe inheritance of traits in peas and other or ganisms earlier , but Mendel\nblended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one\nto keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation.\nThis helped him to arrive at the laws of inheritance.\nFigure 8.3Figure 8.3Figure 8.3Figure 8.3Figure 8.3\nInheritance of traits\nover two generations Activity 8.2Activity 8.2Activity 8.2Activity 8.2Activity 8.2\n/square6In Fig. 8.3, what experiment would we do to confirm that the F2\ngeneration did in fact have a 1:2:1 ratio of TT, Tt and tt trait\ncombinations?\nIn this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a\nshort plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the\nplant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short. T raits\nlike ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are\ncalled r ecessive traits. W ork out which trait would be consider ed\ndominant and which one recessive in Fig. 8.4.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nHeredity 131\nx\nRR yy\n(round, green)rr YY\n(wrinkled, yellow)\nRy\n rY\nRr Yy\n(round, yellow)F1\nx\nRr Yy\nF1Rr Yy\nF1\n315 round, yellow\n108 round, green\n101 wrinkled, yellow\n32 wrinkled, green\n9\n3\n3\n1\n556 seeds16\nFigure 9.5 Independent inheritance of two\nseparate traits, shape and colour of seeds\nRY Ry rY ry\nRY\nRy\nrY\nryRRYY RRYy RrYY RrYy\nRRYy RRyy RrYy Rryy\nRrYY RrYy rrYY rrYy\nRrYy Rryy rrYy rryyF2\nFigure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5\nIndependent inheritance\nof two separate traits,\nshape and colour of seedsWhat happens when pea plants showing two different\ncharacteristics, rather than just one, are bred with each other?\nWhat do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short\nplant with wrinkled-seeds look like? They are all tall and have\nround seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits.\nBut what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate\nF2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find\nthat some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some\nwere short plants with wrinkled seeds.  However , ther e would also\nbe some F2 progeny that showed new combinations. Some of them\nwould be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short,\nbut have r ound seeds. Y ou can see as to how new combinations of\ntraits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed\nshape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form\nF2 offspring (Fig. 8.5). Thus, the tall/short trait and the round\nseed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited.\n8.2.3 How do these T raits get Expressed?\nHow does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is\nthe information source for making proteins in the cell. A section\nof DNA that provides information for one protein is called the\ngene for that protein. How do proteins control the\ncharacteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the\nexample of tallness as a characteristic. W e know that plants\nhave hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus\ndepend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The\namount of the plant hormone made will depend on the\nefficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme\nthat is important for this process. If this enzyme works\nefficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be\ntall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes\nthe enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,\nand the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,\nor traits.\nIf the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been\ndiscussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing\nequally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction.\nWe have disscussed this issue in the pr evious Chapter . If both\nparents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents\nmust be contributing a copy of the same gene. This means that\neach pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from\neach parent. For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must\nhave only one gene set.\nHow do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two\ncopies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a\nsingle whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained\nin Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and\n‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independentlyFigure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 132inherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not\nas a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,\neach called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance\nexplains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all\nsexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms\nalso follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their\ninheritance might work?\n8.2.4 Se x Deter mination\nWe have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual\nreproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number\nof reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual\ndetermined? Different species use very different strategies\nfor this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,\nin some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at\nwhich fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the\nanimals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In\nother animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,\nindicating that sex is not genetically deter mined. However ,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls.\nBut so far , we have assumed that similar gene sets are\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex?\nThe explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair , called the sex chr omosomes, is\nodd in not always being a per fect pair . Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y . So women ar e XX,\nwhile men ar e XY. Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be?\nAs Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome\nfrom their mother regardless of whether they are boys or\ngirls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by\nwhat they inherit from their father . A child who inherits\nan X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one\nwho inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6\nSex determination in\nhuman beings\nReprint 2025-26\n\nHeredity 133QUESTIONS\n?1. How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits may be dominant or\nrecessive?\n2. How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits are inherited\nindependently?\n3. A man with blood group A marries a woman with blood group O and\ntheir daughter has blood group O. Is this information enough to tell you\nwhich of the traits – blood group A or O – is dominant? Why or why not?\n4. How is the sex of the child determined in human beings?\nWhat y ou hav e learnt\n/square6Variations arising during the pr ocess of r eproduction can be inherited.\n/square6These variations may lead to increased survival of the individuals.\n/square6Sexually reproducing individuals have two copies of genes for the same trait. If the\ncopies are not identical, the trait that gets expressed is called the dominant trait\nand the other is called the recessive trait.\n/square6Traits in one individual may be inherited separately, giving rise to new combinations\nof traits in the offspring of sexual reproduction.\n/square6Sex is determined by different factors in various species. In human beings, the\nsex of the child depends on whether the paternal chromosome is X (for girls) or Y\n(for boys).\nEXERCISES\n1.A Mendelian experiment consisted of breeding tall pea plants bearing violet flowers\nwith short pea plants bearing white flowers.

However , we ar e\nunable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room,\nthings become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the\nsunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.\nThis reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.\nWe are able to see thr ough a transpar ent medium as light is transmitted\nthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\nand so on.  A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\nsource of light casts a sharp  shadow of an opaque object points to this\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.More to Know!If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small , light has a tendency to\nbend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of\nlight. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena\nsuch as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study\nin higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that\nthe wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of\nlight with matter , and light often behaves somewhat like a str eam of  particles . This\nconfusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern\nquantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ –\nthe new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.\nIn this Chapter , we shall study the phenomena of r eflection and\nrefraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic\nconcepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in\nnatur e. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the r eflection of light\nby spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real\nlife situations.\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\nA highly polished sur face, such as a mirr or, reflects most of the light\nfalling on it. Y ou ar e already familiar with the laws of r eflection of light.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 135Let us recall these laws –\n(i)The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and\n(ii)The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence\nand the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\nThese laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfaces\nincluding spherical sur faces. Y ou are familiar with the for mation of image\nby a plane mirr or. What ar e the pr operties of the image? Image for med\nby a plane mirror is always virtual and erect.  The size of the image is\nequal to that of the object.  The image formed is as far behind the mirror\nas the object is in fr ont of it.  Further , the image is laterally inverted.\nHow would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved? Let\nus explore.\nActivity 9.1Activity 9.1Activity 9.1Activity 9.1Activity 9.1\n/square6Take a large shining spoon. Try to view your face in its curved\nsurface.\n/square6Do you get the image?  Is it smaller or larger?\n/square6Move the spoon slowly away from your face. Observe the image.\nHow does it change?\n/square6Reverse the spoon and repeat the Activity.  How does the image\nlook like now?\n/square6Compare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces.\nThe curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved\nmirror.  The most commonly used type of curved mirr or is the spherical\nmirror.  The r eflecting sur face of such mirr ors can be consider ed to for m\na part of the surface of a sphere.  Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces\nare spherical, ar e called spherical mirr ors.  W e shall now study about\nspherical mirrors in some detail.\n9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC AL MIRRORSAL MIRRORSAL MIRRORSAL MIRRORSAL MIRRORS\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or\noutwar ds.  A spherical mirr or, whose r eflecting sur face is curved inwar ds,\nthat is, faces towar ds the centr e of the spher e, is called a concave mirr or.\nA spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called\na convex mirr or. The schematic r epresentation of these mirr ors is shown\nin Fig. 9.1. Y ou may note in these diagrams that the back\nof the mirror is shaded.\nYou may now understand that the sur face of the spoon\ncurved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror\nand the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be\napproximated to a convex mirr or.\nBefore we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to\nrecognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These\nterms are commonly used in discussions about spherical\nmirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical\nmirror is a point called the pole.  It lies on the surface of the\nmirror.  The pole is usually r epresented by the letter P .Figure 9.1Figure 9.1Figure 9.1Figure 9.1Figure 9.1\nSchematic representation of spherical\nmirrors; the shaded side is non-reflecting.(a) Concave mirror (b) Convex mirror\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 136The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.\nThis sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of\nthe spherical mirr or. It is r epresented by the letter C. Please note that the\ncentr e of curvatur e is not a part of the mirr or. It lies outside its r eflecting\nsurface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.\nHowever , it lies behind the mirr or in case of a convex mirr or. You may\nnote this in Fig.9.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the\nreflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius\nof curvatur e of the mirr or. It is r epresented by the letter R. You may note\nthat the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight\nline passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical\nmirror. This line is called the principal axis. Remember that principal\naxis is normal to the mirror at its pole. Let us understand an important\nterm related to mirrors, through an Activity.\nActivity 9.2Activity 9.2Activity 9.2Activity 9.2Activity 9.2\nCAUTION : Do not look at the Sun directly or even into a mirror\nreflecting sunlight. It may damage your eyes.\n/square6Hold a concave mirror in your hand and direct its reflecting surface\ntowards the Sun.\n/square6Direct the light reflected by the mirror on to a sheet of paper held\nclose to the mirr or.\n/square6Move the sheet of paper back and forth gradually until you find\non the paper sheet a bright, sharp spot of light.\n/square6Hold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few\nminutes. What do you observe? Why?\nThe paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it\nmay even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged\nat a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirr or. In fact, this spot of light\nis the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper . This point is\nthe focus of the concave mirr or. The heat pr oduced due to\nthe concentration of sunlight ignites the paper . The distance\nof this image from the position of the mirror gives the\napproximate value of focal length of the mirr or.\nLet us try to understand this observation with the help\nof a ray diagram.\nObserve Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel\nto the principal axis are falling on a concave mirr or. Observe\nthe reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a\npoint on the principal axis of the mirr or.  This point is called\nthe principal focus of the concave mirr or. Similarly, observe\nFig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,\nreflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear to\ncome from a point on the principal axis. This point is called\nthe principal focus of the convex mirr or. The principal focus\nis represented by the letter F . The distance between the\npole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called\nthe focal length. It is represented by the letter f.Figure 9.2Figure 9.2Figure 9.2Figure 9.2Figure 9.2\n(a) Concave mirror\n(b)     Convex mirror(b)(a)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 137The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by-and-large spherical.\nThe surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflecting\nsurface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MN\nrepresents the apertur e. We shall consider in our discussion only such\nspherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of\ncurvature.\nIs there a relationship between the radius of curvature R,  and focal\nlength f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,\nthe radius of curvatur e is found to be equal to twice the focal length. W e\nput this as R = 2f  .  This implies that the principal focus of a spherical\nmirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature.\n9.2.1  Image F ormation by Spherical Mir rors\nYou have studied about the image for mation by plane mirr ors. Y ou also\nknow the nature, position and relative size of the images formed by them.\nHow about the images formed by spherical mirrors? How can we locate\nthe image formed by a concave mirror for different positions of the object?\nAre the images real or virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or have\nthe same size? W e shall explor e this with an Activity.\nActivity 9.3Activity 9.3Activity 9.3Activity 9.3Activity 9.3\nYou have alr eady lear nt a way of deter mining the focal length of a\nconcave mirr or. In Activity 9.2, you have seen that the sharp bright\nspot of light you got on the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun. It\nwas a tiny, r eal, inverted image. Y ou got the appr oximate focal length\nof the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from\nthe mirr or.\n/square6Take a concave mirr or.  Find out its appr oximate focal length in\nthe way described above. Note down the value of focal length. (Y ou\ncan also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a\nsheet of paper .)\n/square6Mark a line on a Table with a chalk.  Place the concave mirror on\na stand.  Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over\nthe line.\n/square6Draw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous line\nsuch that the distance between any two successive lines is equal\nto the focal length of the mirr or. These lines will now corr espond\nto the positions of the points P , F and C, r espectively. Remember  –\nFor a spherical mirror of small aperture, the principal focus F lies\nmid-way between the pole P and the centre of curvature C.\n/square6Keep a bright object, say a burning candle, at a position far beyond\nC.  Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you\nobtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on it.\n/square6Observe the image carefully.  Note down its nature, position and\nrelative size with respect to the object size.\n/square6Repeat the activity by placing the candle  – (a) just beyond C,\n(b) at C, (c) between F and C, (d) at F , and (e) between P and F .\n/square6In one of the cases, you may not get the image on the screen.\nIdentify the position of the object in such a case. Then, look for its\nvirtual image in the mirror itself.\n/square6Note down and tabulate your observations.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 138You will see in the above Activity that the natur e, position and size of\nthe image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of the\nobject in r elation to points P , F and C. The image for med is r eal for some\npositions of the object. It is found to be a virtual image for a certain other\nposition. The image is either magnified, reduced or has the same size,\ndepending on the position of the object. A summary of these observations\nis given for your reference in Table 9.1.\n9.2.2 Representation of Images F ormed by Spherical\nMirrors Using Ray Diagrams\nWe can also study the for mation of images by spherical mirr ors by\ndrawing ray diagrams. Consider an extended object, of finite size, placed\nin front of a spherical mirr or. Each small portion of the extended object\nacts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from each\nof these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the\nimage of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from a\npoint could be consider ed.  However , it is mor e convenient to consider\nonly two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram. These rays are\nso chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the\nmirror.\nThe intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of image\nof the point object.  Any two of the following rays can be considered for\nlocating the image.\n(i)A ray parallel to the principal\naxis, after reflection, will pass\nthrough the principal focus\nin case of a concave mirror\nor appear to diverge from\nthe principal focus in\ncase of a convex mirr or.\nThis is illustrated in Fig.9.3\n(a) and (b).(a) (b)\nFigure  9.3Table 9.1  Image formation by a concave mirror for different positions of the object\nPosition of the Position of the Size of the Nature of the\nobject image image image\nAt infinity At the focus F Highly diminished, Real and inverted\npoint-sized\nBeyond C Between F and C Diminished Real and inverted\nAt C At C Same size Real and inverted\nBetween C and F Beyond C Enlarged Real and inverted\nAt F At infinity Image would not be formed\nBetween P and F Behind the mirror Enlarged Virtual and erect\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 139(ii)A ray passing through the\nprincipal focus  of a concave\nmirror or  a ray which is\ndirected towards the\nprincipal focus of a convex\nmirror, after reflection, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.4 (a)\nand (b).\n(iii) A ray passing through the\ncentre of curvature  of a\nconcave mirror or directed\nin the direction of the centre\nof curvature of a convex\nmirror, after r eflection, is\nreflected back along the\nsame path.  This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.5 (a) and\n(b). The light rays come back\nalong the same path\nbecause the incident rays\nfall on the mirror along the\nnormal to the reflecting\nsurface.\n(iv)A ray incident obliquely to\nthe principal axis , towards\na point P (pole of the mirror),\non the concave mirror\n[Fig. 9.6 (a)] or a convex\nmirror [Fig. 9.6 (b)], is\nreflected obliquely. The\nincident and reflected rays\nfollow the laws of reflection\nat the point of incidence\n(point P), making equal\nangles with the principal axis.(a) (b)\nFigure 9.4Figure 9.4Figure 9.4Figure 9.4Figure 9.4\nRemember that in all the above cases the laws of reflection are followed.\nAt the point of incidence, the incident ray is reflected in such a way that\nthe angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.\n(a)Image formation by Concave Mirror\nFigure 9.7 illustrates the ray diagrams for the formation of image\nby a concave mirror for various positions of the object.(b) (a)\nFigure 9.5Figure 9.5Figure 9.5Figure 9.5Figure 9.5\n(a) (b)\nFigure 9.6Figure 9.6Figure 9.6Figure 9.6Figure 9.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 140Figure 9.7Figure 9.7Figure 9.7Figure 9.7Figure 9.7  Ray diagrams for the image formation by a concave mirror\nActivity 9.4Activity 9.4Activity 9.4Activity 9.4Activity 9.4\n/square6Draw neat ray diagrams for each position of the object shown in\nTable 9.1.\n/square6You may take any two of the rays mentioned in the pr evious section\nfor locating the image.\n/square6Compare your diagram with those given in Fig. 9.7.\n/square6Describe the nature, position and relative size of the image formed\nin each case.\n/square6Tabulate the results in a convenient format.\nUses of concave mirrors\nConcave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights and\nvehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light. They are\noften used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. The\ndentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients.\nLarge concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produce\nheat in solar furnaces.\n(b)Image formation by a Convex Mirror\nWe studied the image for mation by a concave mirr or. Now we shall\nstudy the for mation of image by a convex mirr or.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 141We consider two positions of the object for studying the image for med\nby a convex mirr or.  First is when the object is at infinity and the second\nposition is when the object is at a finite distance fr om the mirr or. The ray\ndiagrams for the formation of image by a convex mirror for these two\npositions of the object are shown in Fig.9.8 (a) and (b), respectively.  The\nresults are summarised in Table 9.2.Activity 9.5Activity 9.5Activity 9.5Activity 9.5Activity 9.5\n/square6Take a convex mirr or.

Did you succeed? Explain your\nobservations with reason.\nYou can see a full-length image of a tall building/tr ee in a small\nconvex mirr or. One such mirr or is fitted in a wall of Agra Fort facing T aj\nMahal. If you visit the Agra Fort, try to observe the full image of Taj\nMahal. To view distinctly, you should stand suitably at the terrace\nadjoining the wall.\nUses of convex mirrors\nConvex mirr ors ar e commonly used as r ear-view (wing) mirr ors in\nvehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the\ndriver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex\nmirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though\ndiminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved\noutwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger\narea than would be possible with a plane mirr or.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. Define the principal focus of a concave mirr or.\n2. The radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is 20 cm.  What is its focal\nlength?\n3. Name a mirror that can give an erect and enlarged image of an object.\n4. Why do we pr efer a convex mirr or as a r ear-view mirr or in vehicles?\n9.2.3 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors\nWhile dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall\nfollow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention . In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the\norigin (Fig. 9.9).  The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis\n(X’X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –\n(i)The object is always placed to the left of the mirr or. This implies\nthat the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand\nside.\n(ii)All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the\npole of the mirr or.\n(iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along\n+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of\nthe origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.\n(iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis\n(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.\n(v)Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis\n(along –y-axis) are taken as negative.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 143The New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in\nFig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain\nthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\n9.2.4  Mir ror Formula and  Magnification\nIn a spherical mirror , the distance of the\nobject from its pole is called the object\ndistance ( u).  The distance of the image from\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image\ndistance ( v). You alr eady know that the\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole\nis called the focal length ( f). There is a\nrelationship between these three quantities\ngiven by the mirr or for mula which is\nexpressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f+ = (9.1)\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the\nobject. Y ou must use the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention while substituting numerical\nvalues for u, v, f , and R in the mirror formula\nfor solving problems.\nMagnification\nMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to\nwhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\nIt is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the\nobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.\nIf h is the height of the object and h ′ is the height of the image, then\nthe magnification m  produced by a spherical mirror is given by\nm = Height of the image ( )\nHeight of the object ( )′h\nh\nm = ′h\nh(9.2)\nThe magnification m  is also related to the object distance (u ) and\nimage distance ( v).  It can be expressed as:\nMagnification ( m)  = ′= −h\nhv\nu(9.3)\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis.  The height of the\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images.  However , it is to be\ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the\nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value\nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 144Example 9.1\nA convex mirr or used for r ear-view on an automobile has a radius of\ncurvatur e of 3.00 m.

Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its\ndirection? W e shall r ecall some of our day-to-day experiences.\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond\ncontaining water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab\nis placed over some printed matter , the letters appear raised when viewed\nthrough the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil\npartly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced\nat the inter face of air and water . You might have observed that a lemon\nkept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual\nsize, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for such\nexperiences?\nLet us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil,\npartly immersed in water . The light r eaching you fr om the portion of the\npencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared\nto the part above water . This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at\nthe interface. For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when\nseen through a glass slab placed over it.\nDoes a pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent, if instead of\nwater , we use liquids like kerosene or turpentine? W ill the letters appear\nto rise to the same height if we replace a glass slab with a transparent\nplastic slab? Y ou will find that the extent of the ef fect is dif ferent for\ndifferent pair of media. These observations indicate that light does not\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 146travel in the same direction in all media. It appears that when travelling\nobliquely from one medium to another , the dir ection of pr opagation of\nlight in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as\nrefraction of light. Let us understand this phenomenon further by doing\na few activities .\nActivity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7\n/square6Place a coin at the bottom of a bucket filled with water .\n/square6With your eye to a side above water , try to pick up the coin in one\ngo.

The\ncoin appears slightly raised above its actual position due to refraction of\nlight.\nActivity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9\n/square6Draw a thick straight line in ink, over a sheet of white paper placed\non a Table.\n/square6Place a glass slab over the line in such a way that one of its edges\nmakes an angle with the line.\n/square6Look at the portion of the line under the slab from the sides.

Does the part of the line under the glass slab\nappear bent?\n/square6Look at the line from the top of the glass slab. Does the part of the\nline, beneath the slab, appear to be raised? Why does this happen?\n9.3.1 Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab\nTo understand the phenomenon of refraction of light through a glass\nslab, let us do an Activity.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 147In this Activity, you will note, the light ray has changed its direction\nat points O and O ′. Note that both the points O and O ′ lie on surfaces\nseparating two transparent media. Draw a perpendicular NN’ to AB at O\nand another perpendicular MM ′ to CD at O ′. The light ray at point O has\nentered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to\nglass. Note that the light ray has bent towards\nthe normal. At O ′, the light ray has entered\nfrom glass to air , that is, fr om a denser\nmedium to a rarer medium.  The light here\nhas bent away from the normal. Compare the\nangle of incidence with the angle of refraction\nat both refracting surfaces AB and CD.\nIn Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely\nincident on surface AB, called incident ray.\nOO′ is the refracted ray and O′ H is the\nemer gent ray. Y ou may observe that the\nemergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nthe incident ray. Why does it happen so? The\nextent of bending of the ray of light at the\nopposite parallel faces AB (air -glass inter face)\nand CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular\nglass slab is equal and opposite. This is why\nthe ray emerges parallel to the incident ray.\nHowever , the light ray is shifted sidewar d\nslightly. What happens when a light ray is\nincident normally to the interface of two\nmedia? T ry and find out.\nNow you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to\nchange in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to\nanother .  Experiments show that r efraction of light occurs accor ding to\ncertain laws.Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10\n/square6Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\n/square6Place a rectangular glass slab over the sheet in the middle.\n/square6Draw the outline of the slab with a pencil.

Also produce EF up to P , as shown by a dotted line\nin Fig. 9.10.\nFigure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10\nRefraction of light through a rectangular glass slab\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 148The following are the laws of refraction of light.\n (i)The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface\nof two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the\nsame plane.\n(ii)The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of\nrefraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for\nthe given pair of media.  This law is also known as Snell’s law of\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i  < 90o)\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\nsin\nsini\nr = constant (9.4)\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\nwith respect to the first.  Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\nYou have alr eady studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely fr om\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1.  In air , the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water . The value of the r efractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11.  Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2.  The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21. This can be expressed in an equation form as\nn21=Speed of light in medium 1 \nSpeed of light in medium 2=v\nv1\n2(9.5)\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12. It is given\nby\nn12=Speed of light in medium 2 \nSpeed of light in medium 1=v\nv2\n1(9.6)\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air , then the r efractive index of medium 2\nis considered with respect to vacuum.  This is called the absolute refractive\nindex of the medium.  It is simply represented as n2. If c is the speed ofFigure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 149The ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.\nOptical density has a definite connotation.  It is not the same as mass density. W e have\nbeen using the ter ms ‘rar er medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter . It actually\nmeans  ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the lar ger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other .  The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rar er.  The speed of light is higher in a rarer\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.Note from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive\nindex, is optically denser than water , although its mass density is less\nthan water .Material Refractive Material Refractive\nmedium index medium index\nAir 1.0003 Canada 1.53\nBalsam\nIce 1.31\nWater 1.33 Rock salt 1.54\nAlcohol 1.36\nKerosene 1.44 Carbon 1.63\ndisulphide\nFused 1.46\nquartz Dense 1.65\nflint glass\nTurpentine 1.47\noil Ruby 1.71\nBenzene 1.50\nSapphire 1.77\nCrown 1.52\nglass Diamond  2.42light in air and v is the speed of light in the medium, then, the refractive\nindex of the medium nm is given by\nnm = Speed of light in air \nSpeed of light in the medium =c\nv(9.7)\nThe absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive\nindex. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From\nthe T able you can know that the r efractive index of water , nw = 1.33.\nThis means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of\nlight in water is equal to 1.33.  Similarly, the refractive index of crown\nglass, ng =1.52. Such data ar e helpful in many places.  However , you\nneed not memorise the data.\nTable 9.3  Absolute refractive index of some material mediaMore to Know!\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 1509.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses\nYou might have seen watchmakers using a small magnifying glass to\nsee tiny parts. Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass\nwith your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle\nor at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? W e\nshall discuss these in this section.\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both\nsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\nthat a lens is bound by at least one spherical\nsurface. In such lenses, the other surface would\nbe plane.  A lens may have two spherical\nsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\nalso called converging lenses.  Similarly, a double\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\nsurfaces, curved inwards.  It is thicker at the\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\nare also called diverging lenses. A double concave\nlens is simply called a concave lens.\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,\nhas two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces\nforms a part of a sphere. The centres of these\nspheres are called centres of curvature of the lens.\nThe centre of curvature of a lens is usually\nrepresented by the letter C.  Since there are two\ncentres of curvature, we may represent them as C1 and C2. An imaginary\nstraight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is\ncalled its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It isQUESTIONS\n?1. A ray of light travelling in air enters obliquely into water .

A ray of light through the optical\ncentre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective\ndiameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.\nWe shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose\naperture is much less than its radius of curvature  and the two centres of\ncurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are\ncalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays\nof light are incident on a lens?  Let us do an Activity to understand this.\nActivity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11\nCAUTION : Do not look at the Sun directly or through a lens while\ndoing this Activity or otherwise. Y ou may damage your eyes if you\ndo so.\n/square6Hold a convex lens in your hand. Direct it towards the Sun.\n/square6Focus the light fr om the Sun on a sheet of paper . Obtain a sharp\nbright image of the Sun.\n/square6Hold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while.  Keep\nobserving the paper . What happened? Why? Recall your experience\nin Activity 9.2.\nThe paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fire\nafter a while.  Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutes\nparallel rays of light.  These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp\nbright spot for med on the paper .  In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a\nlens.  What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens.\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However , a lens has two principal foci.  They\nare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the\nposition of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the\napproximate focal length of the lens.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 1529.3.4 Image F ormation by Lenses\nLenses form images by refracting light.

A concave lens\nwill always give a virtual, erect and diminished image, irrespective of the\nposition of the object.\n9.3.5 Image F ormation in Lenses Using Ray Diagrams\n We can r epresent image for mation by lenses using ray diagrams. Ray\ndiagrams will also help us to study the nature, position and relative size\nof the image formed by lenses. For drawing ray diagrams in lenses, alike\nof spherical mirrors, we consider any two of the following rays –\n(i)A ray of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after\nrefraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focus\non the other side of the lens, as shown in Fig. 9.13 (a).

W e apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all\nmeasurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According\nto the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of\na concave lens is negative. Y ou must take car e to apply appropriate\nsigns for the values of u , v, f, object height h and image height h′.\n9.3.7 Lens F ormula and Magnification\nAs we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula for\nspherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between object-\ndistance ( u), image-distance ( v) and the focal length ( f).  The lens formula\nis expressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f− = (9.8)\nThe lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situations\nfor any spherical lens. Take proper care of the signs of different quantities,\nwhile putting numerical values for solving problems relating to lenses.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 156Magnification\nThe magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for spherical\nmirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height\nof the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m . If h is the\nheight of the object and h′ is the height of the image given by a lens, then\nthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,\nm = Height of the Image\nHeight of the object=h\nh′(9.9)\nMagnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance\nu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by\nMagnification (m ) = h′/h = v/u (9.10)\nExample 9.3\nA concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should\nthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.\nSolution\nA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\nof the object.\nImage-distance v =–10 cm;\nFocal length f =–15 cm;\nObject-distance u=?\nSince 1 1 1\nv u f− =\nor,1 1 1–u v f=\n( )1 1 1 1 1– ––10 –15 10 15u= = +\n1 3 2 1\n30 30 u− += =−\nor, u = – 30 cm\nThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.\nMagnification m = v/u\nm = −\n−= +10cm\n30cm1\n30.33;\nThe positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image\nis one-third of the size of the object.\nExample 9.4\nA 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the\nlens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also\nfind its magnification.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 157Solution\nHeight of the object h=+ 2.0 cm;\nFocal length f =+ 10 cm;\nobject-distance u =–15 cm;\nImage-distance v =?\nHeight of the image h ′=?\nSince1 1 1\nv u f− =\nor,1 1 1\nv u f= +\n1 1 1 1 1\n( 15) 10 15 10v= + = − +−\n1 2 3 1\n30 30 v− += =\nor,v = + 30 cm\nThe positive sign of v shows that the image is formed at a distance of\n30 cm on the other side of the optical centre.

It is formed below the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image,\n4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the\nlens. The image is two times enlarged.\n9.3.8 Power of a Lens\nYou have alr eady lear nt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge\nlight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expr essed in ter ms of its power . The power of a lens is defined\nas the r eciprocal of its focal length. It is r epresented by the letter P.  The\npower P of a lens of focal length f is given by\nP = 1\nf(9.11)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 158The SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.\nIf f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1.\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\nconcave lens is negative.\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers.  Let us\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.  This means the lens\nprescribed is convex.  The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\na lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m.  The lens is concave.\nMany optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power ( P) of the lenses placed\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, …   as\nP = P1 + P2 + P3 + …\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses\nof known power , in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates\nthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\nof two lenses of power  + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems\nto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.  Such a lens system,\nconsisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of\ncamera, microscopes and telescopes.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. Define 1 dioptre of power of a lens.\n2. A convex lens forms a real and inverted image of a needle at a distance\nof 50 cm from it.

For example, \nthere is the number 0 (zero), representing nothing, which comes before \n1.  The number 0 has a very important history in India and now in the world. For example, around the world we learn to write numbers in the Indian number system using the digits 0 to 9, allowing us to write numbers however large or however small using just these 10 digits. \nWe then learned about more numbers that exist between the \nnumbers 0,\n 1, 2, 3, 4, … , such \nas 1\n2, 32, and 13\n6. These are called \nfractions.\nBut are there still more numbers? Well, 0 is an additional number \nthat we didn’t know about earlier, and it comes before 1 and is less \nthan 1. Are there perhaps more numbers that come before 0 and are less than 0?\nPhrased another way, we have seen the number line:\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nHowever, this is actually only a number ‘ray ’, in the language we \nlearned earlier in geometry; this ray starts at 0 and goes forever to the right.

To make it even more fun for them, Bela purchased a multi-storied building and filled it with attractions. She named it Bela’s Building of Fun. \nBut this was no ordinary building! \nObserve that some of the floors in the \n‘Building of Fun’ are below the ground. What are the shops that you \nfind on these floors? What is there on the ground floor?\nA lift is used to go up and down between the floors. It has two \nbuttons: ‘+’ to go up and ‘–’ to go down. Can you spot the lift?\nTo go to the Art Centre from the ‘Welcome Hall’, you \nmust press the ‘+’ button twice. \nWe say that the button press is + + or +\n 2.\nTo go down \ntwo floors, you must press the ‘–’ \nbutton twice, which we write as – – or –  2.\nSo if you press \n+ 1 (i.e., if you \npress the ‘+’ \nbutton once), then you will go up one floor and if you press –\n 1 (i.e., if you \npress the ‘–’ button \nonce), then you will go down 1 floor.\nLift button presses and numbers:\n+++ is written as +  3\n – – – – is written as –   4\n What do you press to go four floors up? \nWhat do you press to go three floors down?\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   243 13-08-2024   17:32:06\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6244Numbering the floors in the building of fun\nEntry to the ‘Building of Fun’ is at the ground floor level and is called \nthe ‘Welcome Hall’. Starting from the ground floor, you can reach the Food Court by pressing +\n 1 and can reach \nthe Art Centre by pressing \n+ 2. So, we can \nsay that the Food Court is on Floor +  1 and that the \nArt \nCentre is on Floor +  2.\nStarting from the ground \nfloor, you must press –  1 to reach the \nToy \nStore. So, the Toy Store is on Floor –  1 similarly st\narting from the ground \nfloor, you must press –  2 to reach the \nVideo Games shop. So, the Video \nGames shop is on Floor –  2.\nThe ground floor is \ncalled Floor 0. Can you see why?\n Number all the floors in the Building of Fun.\nDid you notice \nthat +  3 is the floor \nnumber of the Book \nStore, but it is also the number of floors you move when you press +\n 3? Similarly,  \n– 3 is the floor \nnumber \nbut it is also the number of floors you go down when you press –\n 3, i.e., when you press – – – .\nA number with a \n‘+’ sign in front is called a positive \nnumber. A number with a ‘–’ sign in front is called a negative number. \nIn the ‘Building of Fun’, the floors are numbered \nusing the ground floor, Floor 0, as a reference or starting point. The floors above the ground floor are numbered with positive numbers. To get to them from the ground floor, one must press the ‘+’ button some number of times. The floors below the ground are numbered with negative numbers. To get to them from the ground floor, one must press the ‘–’ button some number of times.\nZero is neither a positive nor a negative number. \nWe do not put a ‘+’ or ‘–’ sign in front of it.\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   244 13-08-2024   17:32:07\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Other Side of Zero245Addition to keep track of movement\nStart from the Food Court and press +  2 in the lift.

He can cancel it by pressing  \n–\n 3. That is, (+3) + (–  3) = 0.\nWe call –  3 the inverse of \n+3. Similarly, the inverse of \n– 3 is +3.\nIf Basant now presses \n+4 and then presses –  4 in the \nlift, where will he reach?\nHere \nis another way to think of the concept of \ninverse.

For example, \nconsider this situation: I have ` 10 with me and my sister has ` 6.\nNow, I can ask the question: ʻHow much more money should my \nsister get in order to have the same amount as me?ʼ\nWe can write this in two ways: 6 + ? = 10   Or   10 – 6 = ?\nHere, we see the connection between ‘finding the missing number \nto be added’ and subtraction.\nFor subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use \nthis meaning of subtraction as ‘making equal’ or ‘finding the missing \nnumber to be added’.\n  Evaluate 15  – 5, 100  – 10 and 74  – 34 from this perspective. \nIn general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can \nindicate the change needed to make the quantities equal. Subtraction shows how much the starting quantity should change in order to become the target quantity. In the context of different floor levels, what is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting Floor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase) or negative (for a decrease).\nTeacher’s note\nYour starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the \nSports Centre. What should be your button press?\nYou need to go three floors up, so you should press +  3. We can\n \nwrite this as an expression using subtraction: \nTarget Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed.\nIn the above example, the starting floor is +  2 (Art Centre) and\n \nthe target floor is +  5. The button press \nto get to +  5 from +  2 is +  3. \nTherefore, \n(+ 5) – (+ 2) = + 3\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   248 13-08-2024   17:32:08\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Other Side of Zero249Explanation  \nRecall the connection between addition and subtraction. For 3  + ? = 5, \nwe can find \nthe missing number using subtraction: 5  – 3 = 2. That is, \nsubtr\naction is the same as finding the missing number to be added. \nWe know that  —\nStarting Floor + Movement needed = Target Floor\nIf the movement needed is to be found, then,\nStarting Floor + ? = Target Floor\nSo, \nT\narget Floor – Starting Floor = ? = Movement needed\nMore examples:\na.

The truck is at the ground level, but the minerals are present both above and below the ground level. There is a fast moving lift which moves up and down in a mineshaft carrying people and ore. \nSome of the levels are marked in the \npicture. The ground level is marked 0. Levels above the ground are marked by positive numbers and levels below the ground are marked by negative numbers. The number indicates how many metres above or below the ground level it is.\nIn the mine, just like in the Building of Fun:\nStarting Level + Movement = Target LevelFor example,\n(+\n 40) + (+ 60) = + 100  (– 90) + (–  55) = –  145\nTarget Level – Starting Level = Movement needed\nFor example,\n(+ 40) – (– 50) = + 90   (– 90) – (+ 40) = – 130\nHow many negative numbers are there?\nBela’s Building of Fun had only six floors above and five floors below. \nThat is numbers –  5 to +  6.

In fact, we can imagine a lift that can extend forever upwards and forever downwards, starting from Level 0. There does not even have to be any building or mine around — just an ‘infinite lift’! \nWe can use this imagination to add and subtract any integers we like.\nFor example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction +\n 2000 \n– (– 200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground \nand 200 below the ground. Recall that,\nTarget Level – Starting Level = Movement needed\nTo go from the Starting Floor – 200 to the Target Floor +  2000, we \nmust press \n+ 2200 (+  200 to get to \nzero, and then +  2000 more after \nthat to get to +  2200). Therefore, (+  2000) – (–  200) = +  2200.  \nNotice that (+  2000)  + (+ 200) is also +  2200.\n Try evaluating the following expressions by similarly drawing or \nimagining a suitable lift:\na.  – 125 + (– 30) b.  + 105 – (– 55)  \nc.  + 105 + (+ 55) d.  + 80 – (– 150)  \ne.  + 80 + (+ 150)  f.  – 99 – (– 200)  \ng.  – 99 + (+ 200)  h.  +  1500  – (– 1500) +1000\n+900\n+800\n+700+600\n+500\n+400\n+300+200\n+100\n–\n 100\n– 200\n– 300\n– 400\n– 500\n– 600\n– 700\n– 800\n– 900\n– 10000\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   251 13-08-2024   17:32:08\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6252In the above example, we saw that +  2000  – (– 200)  = + 2000  + (+ 200) \n= + 2200. In other words, \nsubtracting a negative number is the same \nas adding the corresponding positive number. That is, we can \nreplace subtraction of a negative number by addition of a positive number!\n In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice \nthat subtracting a negative number was the same as adding the corresponding positive number?\nTake a look at the ‘infinite lift’ above. Does it remind you \nof a number line?  In what ways?\nBack to the number line\nThe ‘infinite lift’ we saw above looked very much like a number line, didn’t it? In fact, if we rotate it by 90°, it basically becomes a number line. It also tells us how to complete the number ray to a number line, \nanswering the question that we had asked at the beginning of the chapter. To the left of 0 are the negative numbers \n– 1, – 2, – 3, … \nUsually we drop the \n‘+’ sign on positive numbers and simply write \nthem as 1, 2, 3, … \n– 10– 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nInstead of traveling along the number line using a lift, we can \nsimply imagine walking on it. To the right is the positive (forward) direction, and to the left is the negative (backward) direction. \nSmaller numbers are now to the left of bigger numbers and \nbigger numbers are to the right of smaller numbers. So, 2 < 5;  \n– 3 < 2; and – 5 < – 3. \n If, from 5 you wish to go over to 9, how far must you travel along \nthe number line?\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0Math \nTalk\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   252 13-08-2024   17:32:09\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Other Side of Zero253You must travel 4 steps. That is why 5  + 4 = 9. \n(Remember: Starting number + Movement = Target number)\nThe corresponding subtraction statement is 9  – 5 = 4 . \n(Remember:  Target number – Starting number = Movement \nneeded)\n Now, from 9, if you wish to go to 3, how much must you travel \nalong the number line? \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nYou must move 6 steps backward, i.e., you must move –6. Hence, \nwe write 9 + (–6) = 3.  \n(Remember again :  Starting number + Movement = Target \nnumber) \nThe corresponding subtraction statement is 3  – 9 = – 6.  \n(Remember again:   Target number – Starting number = Movement \nneeded)\n Now, from 3, if you wish to go to –  2, how far must you travel?\n– 10– 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nYou must travel –  5 steps, i.e., 5 steps backward. Thus, 3  + (– 5) = – 2. \nThe corresponding subtraction statement is: –  2 – 3 = – 5. \n Figure it Out\n– 10– 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n1.

Other numbers are not \nmarked. It can be convenient to use this unmarked number line to \nadd and subtract integers. You can show, or simply imagine, the scale of the number line and the positions of numbers on it.\nFor example, this unmarked number line (UNL) shows the \naddition problem: 85\n + (– 60) = ? \n  \n+85 +25– 60\n0\nWe then can visualise that 85 + (–  60) = 25\nThe following UNL shows \na subtraction problem which can also be \nwritten as a missing addend problem: (–  100) – (+ 250) = ? or \n250 + ? = –  100. \n+ 250 – 100 0?\nWe can then visualise that ? = –350 in this problem.\nIn this way, you can carry out addition and subtraction problems, \nwith positive and negative numbers, on paper or in your head using an \nunmarked number line.\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   254 13-08-2024   17:32:09\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Other Side of Zero255 Use unmarked number lines to evaluate these expressions: \na. – 125 + (–  30) = __\n_____\nb. + 105 –   (– 55) = __\n_____\nc. + 80 – (–  150) = _\n______\nd. – 99 – (–  200) = _\n______\nConverting subtraction to addition and addition to subtraction\nRecall that  Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed \nor\nTarget Floor = Starting Floor + Movement needed\nIf \nwe start at 2 and wish to go to – 3, what is the movement needed? \nFirst method: Looking at the number line, we see we need to \nmove – 5 (i.e., 5 in the backward direction). Therefore, – 3 – 2 = – 5. \nThe movement needed is –5.\nSecond method: Break the journey from 2 to –3 into two parts. \na. From 2 t\no 0, the movement is 0  – 2 = – 2. \nb. From 0 t\no –3, the movement is –  3 – 0 = – 3.\nThe total movement \nis the sum of the two movements: – 3 + (– 2) = – 5.\nLook at the two coloured expressions. There is no subtraction in \nthe second one!\nIn this way, we can always convert subtraction to addition. The \nnumber that is being subtracted can be replaced by its inverse \nand then added instead.\nSimilarly, a number that is being added can be replaced by \nits inverse and then subtracted.  In this way, we can also always convert addition to subtraction.\nExamples:\n \na . (+ 7 ) – (+ 5) = (+ 7 ) + (– 5)\nb. (– 3) – (+ 8) = (– 3) + (– 8)\nc . (+ 8) – (– 2) = (+ 8) + (+ 2)\nd . (+ 6) – (– 9) = (+ 6) + (+ 9)– 3 0 2– 5\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   255 13-08-2024   17:32:09\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 625610.2 The Token Model\nUsing tokens for addition\nIn Bela’s Building of Fun, the lift attendant is bored. To entertain \nhimself, he keeps a box containing lots of positive (red) and negative (green) tokens. Each time he presses the ‘+’ button, he takes a positive token from the box and puts it in his pocket. Similarly, each time he presses the ‘–’ button, he takes a negative token and puts it in his pocket. \nHe starts on the ground floor (Floor 0) with an empty pocket. After \none hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative tokens. On which floor is he now? \nHe must have pressed ‘+’ five times and ‘–’ 3 times and (+\n 5)+( – 3)= + 2. \nSo, he is at Floor +  2 now. \nHere is another way to do the calculation.\nA positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because \nthe value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in his pocket meant that he pressed ‘+’ once and ‘–’ once, respectively, and these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative token make a ʻzero pairʼ. When you remove all the zero pairs, you are left with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (–3) = +2. \nWe can perform any such addition using tokens! \nExample: Add\n + 5 and –  8. \nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   256 13-12-2024   16:07:51\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Other Side of Zero257From the picture, we see that we can remove five zero pairs, and we \nare then left with –  3. Therefore (+  5) + (– 8) = – 3.\n Figure it Out\n1. Complete the additions using tokens.\n a. (+ 6) + (+ 4) b. (– 3) + (–  2) \n c. (+ 5) + (– 7) d. (– 2) + (+  6)\n2.  Canc\nel the zero pairs in the following two sets of tokens. On what \nfloor is the lift attendant in each case? What is the corresponding \naddition statement in each case?\na .   b .   \nUsing tokens for subtraction\nWe have seen how to perform addition of integers with positive \ntokens and negative tokens. We can also perform subtraction using tokens!\nExample: Let us subtract:  \n(+5) – (+4).\nThis is easy to do. From 5 positives \ntake away 4 positives to see the result.Example: Let us subtract:  \n(–7) – (–5).Is (–\n 7) – (–  5) the same as (–  7) + (+ 5)?\nExample: Let us subtract: (+  5) – (+ 6).\nPut down 5 positives.\nBut there are not enough tokens to take out 6 positives!\n(+ 5) – (+ 4) = + 1\n(–7) – (–5) = –2\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   257 13-08-2024   17:32:24\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6258To get around this issue, we can put out an extra zero pair (a \npositive and a negative), knowing that this does not change the value \nof the set of tokens.\nNow, we can take out 6 positives! \nSee what is left:\nWe conclude that (+5) – (+6) =  – 1.\n Figure it Out\n 1. Evaluate the following differences using tokens. Check that you \nget t\nhe same result as with other methods you now know:\na. (+ 10) – (+ 7) b. (– 8) – (– 4) c. (– 9) – (– 4) \nd. (+ 9) – (+ 12) e. (– 5) – (– 7) f. (– 2) – (– 6)\n2. Comp\nlete the subtractions: \na. (– 5) – (– 7) b. (+ 10) – (+ 13) c. (– 7) – (– 9) \nd. (+ 3) – (+ 8) e. (– 2) – (– 7) f. (+ 3) – (+ 15) \nExample: +  4 –  (– 6).\nStart with 4 positives.\nWe have to \ntake out 6 negatives from these. But there are not \nenough negatives.\nThis is not a problem. We add some zero pairs as this does not \nchange the value of the set of tokens. \nBut how many zero pairs? We have to take away 6 negatives so \nwe put down 6 zero pairs: \nNow we can take away 6 negatives:\n Therefore, +  4 – (– 6) = + 10.\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   258 13-08-2024   17:32:36\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Other Side of Zero259 Figure it Out\n1.

Your bank balance \ntherefore, starts at ` 100. \nThen you make `60 at your job the next day and you deposit it in \nyour account. This is shown in your bank passbook as a ‘credit’. \n Your new bank balance is _______. \n  The next day \nyou pay your electric bill of `30 using your bank \naccount. This is shown in your bank passbook as a ‘debit’.\n Your bank balance is now ______.\n  The next day \nyou make a major purchase for your business of \n`150. Again this is shown as a debit. \n What is your bank balance now? ______ \n Is this possible?\nYes, some banks \ndo allow your account balance to become negative, \ntemporarily! Some banks also charge you an additional amount if your balance becomes negative, in the form of ‘interest’ or a ‘fee’.\nYour strategic large purchase the previous day allows you to \nmake, `200 at your business the next day. \nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   259 13-08-2024   17:32:36\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6260 What is your balance now? ______\nYou can think of ‘credits’ as positive numbers and ‘debits’ as negative \nnumbers. The total of all your credits (positive numbers) and debits (negative numbers) is your total bank account balance. This can be positive or negative!\nIn general, it is better to try to keep a positive balance in your \nbank account! \n Figure it Out\n1. Suppose you start with `0 in your bank account, and then you \nhave credits of `30, `40, and `50, and debits of `40, `50, and `60. \nWhat is your bank account balance now?\n2. Supp\nose you start with `0 in your bank account, and then you have \ndebits of `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128, and then a single credit of \n`256. What is your bank account balance now?\n3. Why i\ns it generally better to try and maintain a positive balance in \nyour bank account? What are circumstances under which it may \nbe worthwhile to temporarily  have a negative balance?\nAs you can see, positive and negative numbers along with zero are \nextremely useful in the world of banking and accounting.\nGeographical cross sections\nWe measure the height of geographical features like mountains, plateaus, and deserts from ‘sea level’. The height at sea level is 0m. Heights above sea level are represented using positive numbers and heights below sea level are represented using negative numbers. \nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   260 13-08-2024   17:32:36\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Other Side of Zero261 Figure it Out\n1.

In one of China’s most important mathematical works, The Nine Chapters on Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu)—which was completed by the first or second century CE—positive and negative numbers were represented using red and black rods, much like the way we represented them using green and red tokens!\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   266 13-12-2024   16:08:29\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Other Side of Zero267There was a strong culture of accountancy also in India in ancient \ntimes. The concept of credit and debit was written about extensively \nby Kautilya in his Arthaśhāstra  (c. 300 BCE), including the recognition \nthat an account balance could be negative. The explicit use of negative numbers in the context of accounting is seen in a number of ancient Indian works, including in the Bakśhālī  manuscript from around the \nyear 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special symbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as we do today).\nThe first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers, \nand zero\n — all on an equal \nfooting as equally-valid numbers on \nwhich one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division\n — was given by \nBrahmagupta in \nhis Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta in the year 628 CE. Brahmagupta gave \nclear and explicit rules for operations on all numbers  — positive, \nnegative, and zero  — that essentially formed the \nmodern way of \nunderstanding these numbers that we still use today!\nSome of Brahmagupta’s key rules for addition and subtraction of \npositive numbers, negative numbers and zero are given below:\nBrahmagupta’s Rules for Addition (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta \n18.30, 628 CE)\n1. The sum of two positives is positive (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). \n2. The s\num of two negatives is negative. To add two negatives, add \nthe numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to \nobtain the result (e.g., ( – 2) + ( – 3) = –  5).\n3. To ad\nd a positive number and a negative number, subtract the \nsmaller number (without the sign) from the greater number (without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to obtain the result (e.g., –\n  5 + 3 = – 2,  2 + ( – 3) = –  1 and –  3 + 5 = 2).\n4. The su\nm of a number and its inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + ( – 2) = 0). \n5\n. The s\num of any number and zero is the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 \n= – 2 and 0 + 0 = 0\n).\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   267 13-08-2024   17:32:41\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6268Brahmagupta’s Rules for Subtraction (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta \n18.31-18.32)\n1. If a smaller positive is subtracted from a larger positive, the result \nis po\nsitive (e.g., 3 – 2 = 1). \n2. If a l\narger positive is subtracted from a smaller positive, the result \nis negative (e.g., 2 – 3 = –  1).\n3. Subt\nracting a negative number is the same as adding the \ncorresponding positive number (e.g., 2 – ( – 3) = 2 + 3).\n4\n. Subt\nracting a number from itself gives zero (e.g., 2 – 2 = 0 and –  2 – \n(– 2) = 0).\n5\n. Subt\nracting zero from a number gives the same number (e.g., – 2 \n– 0 = – 2 and \n0 –  0 = 0)\n. Subtracting a number from zero gives the \nnumber’s inverse (e.g., 0 –   (– 2) = 2).\nOnce you understand Brahmagupta’s rules, you can do addition \nand subtraction with any numbers whatsoever — positive, negative, \nand zero!\n  Figure it Out\n1. Can you explain each of Brahmagupta’s rules in terms of Bela’s \nBui\nlding of Fun, or in terms of a number line? \n2. Give y\nour own examples of each rule.\nBrahmagupta was the first to describe zero as a number on \nan equal  footing with positive numbers \nas well as with negative \nnumbers, and the first to give explicit rules for performing arithmetic \noperations on all such numbers, positive, negative, and zero—forming what is now called a ring. It would change the way the world does \nmathematics.\nHowever, it took many centuries for the rest of the world to \nadopt zero and negative numbers as numbers. These numbers were transmitted to, accepted by, and further studied by the Arab world by the 9th century, before making their way to Europe by the 13th\n century. \nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   268 13-08-2024   17:32:41\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Other Side of Zero269Surprisingly, negative numbers were still not accepted by many \nEuropean mathematicians even in the 18th century. Lazare Carnot, a \nFrench mathematician in the 18th century, called negative numbers ‘absurd’.  But over time, zero as well as negative numbers proved to be indispensable in global mathematics and science, and are now considered to be critical numbers on an equal footing with and as important as positive numbers\n — just as Brahmagupta \nhad \nrecommended and explicitly described way back in the year 628 CE! This abstraction of arithmetic rules on all numbers paved the way for the modern development of algebra, which we will learn about in future classes.\nSummary\n \u001fThere are numbers that are less than zero. They are written with a ‘–’ \nsign in front \nof them (e.g., – 2), and are called negative numbers\n. They \nlie to the left of zero on the number line.\n \u001fThe numbers ..., – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, \n3, 4, ... are called integers. The \nnumbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called positive integers  and the numbers …, \n– 4, – 3, – 2, – 1 are called negative integers. \nZero (0) is neither positive \nnor negative.\n \u001fEvery given number has \nanother number associated to it which when \nadded to the given number gives zero. This is called the additive \ninverse of the number. For example, the additive inverse of 7 is – 7 and \nthe additive inverse of – 543 is 543.\n \u001fAddition can be \ninterpreted as Starting Position + Movement = Target \nPosition.\n \u001fAddition can also \nbe interpreted as the combination of movements or \nincreases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement.\n \u001fSubtraction can be \ninterpreted as Target Position – Starting Position \n= Movement.\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   269 13-08-2024   17:32:43\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6270 \u001fIn general, we can add two numbers by following Brahmagupta’s Rules \nfor Addition:\na. If bo\nth numbers are positive, add the numbers and the result is a \npositive number (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5).\nb. If bo\nth numbers are negative, add the numbers (without the signs), \nand then place a minus sign to obtain the result ( – 2 + ( – 3) = –  5).\nc. If on\ne number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the \nsmaller number (without the sign) from the greater number (without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to obtain the result (e.g., –\n 5 + 3 = – 2).\nd. A numbe\nr plus its additive inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + ( – 2) = 0).\ne\n. A numbe\nr plus zero gives back the same number (e.g., –  2 + 0 = – 2).\n \u001fWe can subtr\nact two integers by converting the problem into an addition \nproblem and then following the rules of addition. Subtraction of an integer is the same as the addition of its additive inverse. \n \u001fIntegers can be compared: \n… – 3 < – 2 < – 1 < 0 < \n+1 < +2 < +3 < ... Smaller \nnumbers are to the left of larger numbers on the number line.\n \u001fWe can give \nmeaning to positive and negative numbers by interpreting \nthem as credits and debits. We can also interpret positive numbers as distances above a reference point like the ground level. Similarly, negative numbers can be interpreted as distances below the ground level. When measuring temperatures in degrees Celsius, positive temperatures are those above the freezing point of water, and negative temperatures are those below the freezing point of water.\nChapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   270 13-08-2024   17:32:43\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Other Side of Zero271Integers: Snakes and Ladders\nRules\n• This is a two \nplayer game.

{"class": "6", "subject": "math", "chapter": "Chapter 1: patterns in mathematics", "content": "PATTERNS IN\n MATHEMATICS1\n1.1 What is Mathematics?\nMathematics is, in large part, the search for patterns, and for \nthe explanations as to why those patterns exist.\nSuch patterns indeed exist all around us  — in nature, in \nour homes and schools, and in the motion of the sun, moon, and stars. They occur in everything that we do and see, from shopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and pla\nying games, to \nunderstanding weather patterns and using technology.\nThe search for patterns and their explanations can be a fun \nand creative endeavour. It is for this reason that mathematicians think of mathematics both as an art and as a science. This year, we hope that you will get a chance to see the creativity and artistry involved in discovering and understanding mathematical patterns.\nIt is important to keep in mind that mathematics \naims to not just find out what patterns exist, but also the explanations for why they exist. Such explanations can often then be used in applications well beyond the context in which they were discovered, which can then help to propel  \nhumanity forward.\nChapter 1_Patterns in Mathematics.indd   1 13-08-2024   16:10:52\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 62For example, the understanding of patterns in the motion of stars, \nplanets, and their satellites led humankind to develop the theory of \ngravitation, allowing us to launch our own satellites and send rockets to the Moon and to Mars; similarly, understanding patterns in genomes has helped in diagnosing and curing diseases\n — among thousands of \nother such examples.\n Figure it Out\n1. Can you think of other examples where mathematics helps \nus in our everyday lives?\n2. How has mathematics helped propel humanity forward? (You might think \nof examples involving: carrying out scientific \nexperiments; running our economy and democracy; building bridges, houses or other complex structures; making TVs, mobile phones, computers, bicycles, trains, cars, planes, calendars, clocks, etc.)\n1.2 Patterns in Numbers\nAmong the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are \npatterns of numbers, particularly patterns of whole numbers:\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... \nThe branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in whole \nnumbers is called number theory.\nNumber sequences are the most basic and among the most \nfascinating types of patterns that mathematicians study. \nTable 1 shows some key number sequences that are studied in \nMathematics.Math \nTalk\nChapter 1_Patterns in Mathematics.indd   2 13-08-2024   16:10:52\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPatterns in Mathematics3Table 1: Examples of number sequences\n 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...

Visualising \nmathematical objects through pictures or diagrams can be a very fruitful way to understand mathematical patterns and concepts. \nLet us represent the first seven sequences in Table 1 using the \nfollowing pictures.Math \nTalk\nChapter 1_Patterns in Mathematics.indd   3 13-08-2024   16:10:52\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 64Table 2: Pictorial representation of some number sequences \nSquares\n1 4 9 16 25Triangular \nnumbers\n6 3 1 10 15\nCubes\n27 8 1 64 125           All 1’s\n 1  1  1  1  1  \n          Counting \n 1  2   3  4  5 numbers\n           Odd\n 1  3  5  7  9  numbers\n        Even\n 2  4  6  8  10  numbers\nChapter 1_Patterns in Mathematics.indd   4 13-08-2024   16:10:52\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPatterns in Mathematics5 Figure it Out  \n1.

Do you think it will happen forever?\nThe answer is that the pattern does happen forever. But why? \nAs mentioned earlier, the reason why the pattern happens is just as \nimportant and exciting as the pattern itself.\nA picture can explain it\nVisualising with a picture can help explain the phenomenon. Recall \nthat square numbers are made by counting the number of dots in a square grid.\n How can we partition the dots in a square grid into odd \nnumbers of dots: 1, 3, 5, 7,... ? \nThink about it for a moment before reading further!Math \nTalk\nChapter 1_Patterns in Mathematics.indd   6 13-08-2024   16:10:53\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPatterns in Mathematics7Here is how it can be done:\nThis picture now makes it evident that \n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36.\nBecause such a picture can be made for a square of any size, this \nexplains why adding up odd numbers gives square numbers.\n By drawing a similar picture, can you say what is the sum of the \nfirst 10 odd numbers? \n Now by imagining a similar picture, or by drawing it partially, as \nneeded, can you say what is the sum of the first 100 odd numbers?\nAnother example of such a relation between sequences:  \nAdding up and down\nLet us look at the following pattern:\n   1 = 1\n   1 + 2 + 1 = 4\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 16\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 25\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 36 \nThis seems to be giving yet another way of getting the square numbers—\nb\ny adding the counting numbers up and then down!...\nChapter 1_Patterns in Mathematics.indd   7 13-08-2024   16:10:53\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 68 Can you find a similar pictorial explanation?\n Figure it Out  \n1.

These shapes may be in one, two, or three dimensions (1D, 2D, or 3D)\n — or in even more \ndimensions.   The \nbranch \nof Mathematics that studies patterns in shapes is called \ngeometry.\nShape sequences are one important type of shape pattern that \nmathematicians study.

Can you recognise the pattern in each of the sequences in \nTable 3?\n2. Try and redraw each sequence in Table 3 in your notebook. Can you dr\naw the next shape in each sequence? Why or why \nnot? After each sequence, describe in your own words what is the rule or pattern for forming the shapes in the sequence.\n1.6  Relation to Number Sequences\nOften, shape sequences are related to number sequences in \nsurprising ways. Such relationships can be helpful in studying and understanding both the shape sequence and the related number sequence.Example: The number of sides in the shape sequence of Regular \nPolygons is given by the counting numbers starting at 3, i.e., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, .... That is why these shapes are called, respectively, regular triangle, quadrilateral (i.e., square), pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, \noctagon , nonagon, decagon , etc., respectively. \nThe word ‘regular’ refers to the fact that these shapes have  \nequal-length sides and also equal ‘angles’ (i.e., the sides look the same and the corners also look the same). We will discuss angles in more depth in the next chapter. \nThe other shape sequences in Table 3 also have beautiful \nrelationships with number sequences.\n Figure it Out\n1. Count the number of sides in each shape in the sequence \nof Regular Polygons. \nWhich number sequence do you get? \nWhat about the number of corners in each shape in the sequence of Regular Polygons? Do you get the same number sequence? Can you explain why this happens?\n2.\n Count the number of lines in each shape in the sequence of Complete Gr\naphs. Which number sequence do you get? \nCan you explain why?Math \nTalk\nTry\nThis\nChapter 1_Patterns in Mathematics.indd   11 13-08-2024   16:10:53\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6123. How many little squares are there in each shape of the \nsequence of Stacked Squares? Which number sequence \ndoes this give? Can you explain why?\n4. How many little triangles are there in each shape of the sequence of Stacked Triangles? Which \nnumber sequence \ndoes this give? Can you explain why? (Hint: In each shape in the sequence, how many triangles are there in each row?)\n5.\n To get from \none shape to the next shape in the Koch \nSnowflake sequence, one replaces each line segment   ‘—’ \nby a ‘speed bump’ . As one does this more and more \ntimes, the changes become tinier and tinier with very very small line segments. How many total line segments are there in each shape of the Koch Snowflake? What is the corresponding number sequence? (The answer is 3, 12, 48, ..., i.e., 3 times Powers of 4; this sequence is not shown in Table 1.)\nSummary\n \u001fMathematics may be viewed as the search for patterns and for the \nexplanations as to why those patterns exist.\n \u001fAmong the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are number sequences.\n \u001fSome important examples of number sequences include the counting numbers, odd numbers, even numbers, square numbers, triangular numbers, cube numbers, Virahānka numbers, and powers of 2.\n \u001fSometimes number sequences can be related to each other in beautiful and remarkable ways. For example, adding up the sequence of odd numbers starting with 1 gives square numbers. \n \u001fVisualising number sequences using pictures can help to understand sequences and the relationships between them.\n \u001fShape sequences are another basic type of pattern in mathematics. \nSome important examples of shape sequences include regular polygons, complete graphs, stacked triangles and squares, and Koch snowflake iterations. Shape sequences also exhibit many interesting relationships with number sequences. Try\nThis\nChapter 1_Patterns in Mathematics.indd   12 13-08-2024   16:10:54\nReprint 2025-26\n"}

These ideas form the building blocks of ‘plane geometry’, and will help us in understanding more advanced topics in geometry such as the construction and analysis of different shapes.\n \n2. 1 Point\nMark a dot on the paper with a sharp tip of a pencil. The sharper the \ntip, the thinner will be the dot. This tiny dot will give you an idea of a point. A point determines a precise location, but it has no length, breadth or height. Some models for a point are given below. \nThe tip of a \ncompass\nThe sharpened \nend of a pencil The pointed \nend of a needle \nIf you mark three points on a piece of paper, \nyou may be required to distinguish these three points. For this purpose, each of the three points may be denoted by a single capital letter such as \nPZ\nT\nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   13 13-08-2024   16:14:25\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 614Z, P and T. These points are read as ‘Point Z’, ‘Point P’ and ‘Point T’. Of \ncourse, the dots represent precise locations and must be imagined to be invisibly thin.\n \n2.2 Line Segment\nFold a piece of paper and unfold it. Do you \nsee a crease? This gives the idea of a line segment. It has two end points, A and B.\nMark any two points A and B on a sheet of \npaper. Try to connect A to B by various routes  (Fig. 2.1).\nWhat is the shortest route from A to B? \nThis shortest path from \nPoint A to Point \nB \n(including A and B) as shown here is called the line segment from A to B. It is denoted by \neither \nAB or BA. The points A and B are called \nthe end points of the line segment AB.\n 2.3 Line\nImagine that the line segment from A to B (i.e., \nAB) is extended beyond A in one direction and beyond B in the other direction without any end (see Fig. 2.2). This is a model for a line. Do \nyou think you can draw a complete picture of a line? No. Why?\nA line through two points A and B is written as AB\n. It extends \nforever in both directions. Sometimes a line is denoted by a letter like l or m.\nObserve that any two points determine a unique line that passes \nthrough both of them.A\nB\nB\nA\nFig. 2.1\nABm\nFig. 2.2\nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   14 13-08-2024   16:14:25\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLines and Angles152.4 Ray\nA ray is a portion of a line that starts at one point (called the starting  \npoint or initial point of the ray) and goes on endlessly in a direction. \nThe following are some models for a ray:\nBeam of light from a \nlighthouse   Ray of light from a torch Sun rays\nLook at the diagram (Fig. 2.3) of a ray.

It starts at O and \npasses through the point A. It also passes \nthrough the point B.\na. Can you also name it as OB? Why? \nb. Can we write OAas AO? Why or why not? \n2.5 Angle\nAn angle is formed by two rays having a \ncommon starting point. Here is an angle formed by rays BD\n and BE  where B is \nthe common starting point (Fig. 2.8).\nThe point B is called the vertex of the \nangle, and the rays BD  and BE are called \nthe arms of the angle. How can we name \nthis angle? We can simply use the vertex and say that it is the Angle  B. \nTo be \nclearer, we use a point on each of the arms together with the \nvertex to name the angle. In this case, we name the angle as Angle DBE or Angle EBD. The word angle can be replaced by the symbol ‘∠ ’, i.e., \n∠DBE or ∠ EBD. Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always \nwritten as the middle letter.\nTo indicate an angle, we use a small curve at the vertex (refer \nto\n Fig. 2.9).\nVidya has just opened her book. Let us observe her opening the \ncover of the book in different scenarios.\nCase 1  Case 2  Case 3  Case 4  Case 5  Case 6\nOBA\nFig. 2.7\nFig. 2.8BD\nEvertexarm\narm\nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   17 13-08-2024   16:14:27\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 618 Do you see angles being made in each of these cases? Can you mark \ntheir arms and vertex?\nWhich angle is greater—the angle in Case 1 or the angle in \nCase 2? \nJust as we talk about the size of a line based on its length, we also \ntalk about the size of an angle based on its amount of rotation. \nSo, the angle in Case 2 is greater as in this case she needs to rotate \nthe cover more. Similarly, the angle in Case 3 is even larger than that \nof Case 2, because there is even more rotation, and Cases 4, 5, and 6 are successively larger angles with more and more rotation.\nThe size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn that is needed \nabout the vertex to move the first ray to the second ray. \nFig. 2.9Final position of ray\nAmount of turn is the size of \nthe angle\nVertex Initial position of ray\nLet’s look at some other examples where angles arise in real life \nby rotation or turn:  \n• In a compass or divider, we turn the arms to form \nan angle. The vertex is the point where the two arms are joined. Identify the arms and vertex of the angle.  \n• A pair of scissors has two blades. When we open them (or ‘turn them’) to cut something, the blades form an angle. Identify the arms and the vertex of the angle. \nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   18 13-08-2024   16:14:27\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLines and Angles19• Look at the pictures of spectacles, wallet and other common \nobjects.

Do you see any angles \nhere? If yes, mark the arms and vertex of each one. Some mouths are open wider than others; the more the turning of the jaws, the larger the angle!

While superimposing, the vertices of the angles must overlap.\nAfter superimposition, it becomes clear which angle is smaller \nand which is larger. \nBA\nC QP\nR Q (B)PA\nC R\nThe picture shows the two angles superimposed. It is now clear \nthat ∠PQR is larger than ∠ABC.\nEqual angles. Now consider ∠ AOB and ∠ XOY in the figure. Which \nis greater? \nY OX\nO B YX\nA\nO BA\nThe corners of both of these angles match and the arms overlap with \neach other, i.e., OA ↔  OX and OB ↔  OY. So, the angles are equal in size.\nThe reason these angles are considered to be equal in size is \nbecause when we visualise each of these angles as being formed out of rotation, we can see that there is an equal amount of rotation needed to move  \nOB to OA  and OY to OX.\nFrom the point of view of superimposition, when two angles \nare superimposed, and the common vertex and the two rays of both angles lie on top of each other, then the sizes of the angles are equal.  \nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   22 13-08-2024   16:14:29\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLines and Angles23 Where else do we use superimposition to compare?\n Figure it Out  \n1.

But can we do it without superimposition?\nSuppose we have a transparent circle which can be moved and \nplaced on figures. Can we use this for comparison? \nLet us place the circular paper on the angle made by the first \ncrane. The circle is placed in such a way that its centre is on the vertex of the angle.

Sometimes students might think that increasing the length of the arms of the angle increases the angle. For this, various situations should be posed to the students to check their understanding on the same. \n2.7 Making Rotating Arms\nLet us make ‘rotating arms’ using two paper straws and a paper clip \nby following these steps:\n1.

Insert the straws into the arms of the paper clip. \n3.\n Your rotating arm is ready!\nMake several ‘rotating arms’ with different angles between the\n \narms. Arrange the angles you have made from smallest to largest by comparing and using superimposition.\nPassing through a slit: Collect a number of rotating arms with different \nangles; do not rotate any of the rotating arms during this activity.\nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   25 13-08-2024   16:14:30\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 626Take a cardboard and make an angle-shaped slit as shown below \nby tracing and cutting out the shape of one of the rotating arms.\nNow, shuffle and mix up all the rotating arms. Can you identify \nwhich of the rotating arms will pass through the slit? \nThe correct one can be found by placing each of the rotating arms \nover the slit. Let us do this for some of the rotating arms:\nSlit angle is greater than \nthe arms’ angle. The arms will not go through the slit. Slit angle is less than the arms’ angle. The arms will not go through\n the \nslit.Slit angle is equal to the arms’ angle. The arms will go through the\n slit. \nOnly the pair of rotating arms where the angle is equal to that of the \nslit passes through the slit. Note that the possibility of passing through \nthe slit depends only on the angle between the rotating arms and not on their lengths (as long as they are shorter than the length of the slit).\nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   26 13-08-2024   16:14:31\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLines and Angles27\nChallenge: Reduce \nthis angle.

In this case, observe the arms of the angle formed. They lie in a straight line. Such an angle is called a straight angle. \nA O B\nLet us consider a straight angle ∠ AOB. Observe that any ray OC \ndivides it into two angles, ∠ AOC and ∠ COB.\nFig. 2.11\nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   27 12-12-2024   10:36:03\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 628\n Is it possible to draw OC such that the two angles are \nequal to each other in size? \nLet’s Explore\nWe can try to solve this problem using a piece of paper. Recall that when \na fold is made, it creates a crease which is straight.\nTake a rectangular piece of paper and on one of its sides, mark \nthe straight angle AOB. By folding, try to get a line (crease) passing through O that divides ∠ AOB into two equal angles.\nHow can it be done? \nFold the paper such that OB overlaps with OA. Observe the crease \nand the two angles formed.Math \nTalk\nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   28 13-08-2024   16:14:33\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLines and Angles29Justify why the two angles are equal. Is there a way to \nsuperimpose and check? Can this superimposition be done by \nfolding? \nEach of these equal angles formed are called right angles. So, a \nstraight angle contains two right angles.\nWhy shouldn't you \nargue with a 90  ̊ \nangle?Because they're \nalways right.\n If a straight angle is formed by half of a full turn, how much of a \nfull turn will form a right angle?  \nObserve that a right angle resembles the shape of an ‘L’. An angle \nis a right angle only if it is exactly half of a straight angle. Two lines\n \nthat meet at right angles are called perpendicular lines.\n Figure it Out  \n1.

Describe how you folded the paper so that any other person \nwho doesn’t know the process can simply follow your description to get the right angle.\nClassifying Angles\nAngles are classified in three groups as shown below. Right angles \nare shown in the second group. What could be the common feature of the other two groups?\nIn the first group, all angles are less than a right angle or in other \nwords, less than a quarter turn. Such angles are called acute angles.\nIn the third group, all angles are greater than a right angle but \nless than a straight angle. The turning is more than a quarter turn and less than a half turn. Such angles are called obtuse angles.\n Figure it Out\n1.

But can we actually \nquantify how big an angle is using a number without having to compare it to another angle?\nWe saw how various angles can be compared using a circle. \nPerhaps a circle could be used to assign measures for angles?\nFig. 2.12\nTo assign precise measures to angles, mathematicians came up \nwith an idea. They divided the angle in the centre of the circle into \nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   32 13-08-2024   16:14:34\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLines and Angles33360 equal angles or parts. The angle measure of each of these unit \nparts is 1 degree, which is written as 1°.\nThis unit part is used to assign measure to any angle: the measure \nof an angle is the number of 1° unit parts it contains inside it. For example,\n see this figure:\n30 units\nIt contains 30 units of 1° angle and so we say that its angle measure is 30°.\nMeasures of different angles: What is the measure of a full turn in \ndegrees? As we have taken it to contain 360 degrees, its measure is 360°.\n What is the measure of a straight angle in degrees? A straight \nangle is half of a full turn. As a full-turn is 360°, a half turn is 180°.What is the measure \nof a right angle in degrees? Two right angles \ntogether form a straight angle. As a straight angle measures 180°, a right angle measures 90°.\nA O180 units\n90 unitsB\nA\nO BA\nO BA O B\nA pinch of historyA full turn has been divided into 360°. Why 360?

The Rigveda, one of the very \noldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of \na wheel with 360 \nspokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars, \nalso going back over 3000 years—such as calendars of India, Persia, Babylonia and Egypt—were based on having 360 days in a year. In addition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60 and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s. \nPerhaps the most important and practical answer for why \nmathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360 degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided by all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the circle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole number of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible by 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of hours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful. \n The circle has been divided into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 10 and 12 parts \nbelow. What are the degree measures of the resulting angles? Write the degree measures down near the indicated angles.\nDegree measures of different angles\nHow can we measure other angles in degrees? It is for this purpose that we have a tool called a protractor that is either a circle divided into 360 equal parts as shown in Fig. 2.12 (on page 32), or a half circle divided into 180 equal parts.\nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   34 14-08-2024   14:20:57\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLines and Angles35Unlabelled protractor\nHere is a protractor. Do you see the straight angle at the center \ndivided into 180 units of 1 degree? Only part of the lines dividing the straight angle are visible, though!  \nStarting from the \nmarking on the rightmost point of the base, there is a long mark for every 10°. From every such long mark, there is a medium sized mark after 5°.\n Figure it out\n1. Write the measures of the \nfollowing angles:\na.\t∠ KAL \nNotice that the vertex of this \nangle coincides with the centre of \nthe protractor.

They have to quickly discuss and guess the number of degrees in the angle (without using a protractor!).\n• Team 1 now demonstrates the true measure of the angle with a protractor. \n• Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute difference in degrees between their guess and the correct measure. For example, if Team 2 guesses 39°, then they score 10 points (49°–39°).\n• Each team gets five turns. The winner is the team with the lowest score!\n Let’s Play a Game #2\nWe now change the rules of the game a bit. Play this game with your classmates by again making two teams, Team 1 and Team 2.

Other members of Team 2 can help the player by speaking words like ‘Make it bigger!’ or ‘Make it smaller!’.\n• A player from Team 1 measures the angle with a protractor for all to see. \n• Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute difference in degrees between Team 2’s angle size and the intended angle size. For example, if player’s angle from Team  2 is measured to be 25°, then Team 2 scores 9 points (34°–25°).\n• Each team gets five turns. The winner is again the team with the lowest score.\nTeacher’s Note\nThese games are important to play to build intuition about angles \nand their measures. Return to this game at least once or twice on different days to build practice in estimating angles. Note that these games can also be played between pairs of students.\n Figure it Out  \n1.

Two rays OP and OM form the angle ∠POM (also called ∠MOP); \nhere, O is called the vertex of the angle, and the rays OP and OM are \ncalled the arms of the angle.\n \u001fThe size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn needed about the vertex to rotate one ray of the angle onto the other ray of the angle. \n \u001fThe sizes of angles can be measured in degrees. One full rotation or turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360°.\n \u001fDegree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor.\n \u001fAngles can be straight (180°), right (90°), acute (more than 0° and less than 90°), obtuse (more than 90° and less than 180°), and reflex (more than 180° and less than 360°).\nChapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   54 13-08-2024   16:14:43\nReprint 2025-26\n"}

In 1937, the German mathematician, Lothar Collatz conjectured that the sequence will always reach 1, regardless of the whole number you start with. Even today\n — despite many \nmathematicians working on it — it remains an unsolved problem as\n \nto whether Collatz’s conjecture is true! Collatz’s conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.\n Make some more Collatz sequences like those above, starting \nwith your favourite whole numbers. Do you always reach 1?  \nDo you believe the conjecture of Collatz that all such sequences \nwill eventually reach 1?  Why or why not?\n3.11 Simple Estimation\nAt times, we may not know or need an exact count of things and an estimate is sufficient for the purpose at hand. For example, your school headmaster might know the exact number of students enrolled in your school, but you may only know an estimated count. How many students are in your school? About 150? 400? A thousand?\nParomita’s class section has 32 children. The other 2 sections of \nher class have 29 and 35 children. So, she estimated the number of children in her class to be about 100. Along with Class 6, her school also has Classes 7–10 and each class has 3 sections each. She assumed a similar number in each class and estimated the number of students in her school to be around 500.\n Figure it Out\n  We shall do some simple estimates. It is a fun exercise, and you may \nfind it amusing \nto know the various numbers around us.

Can you help them?\n Naresh and Navya decided to go to each student in the class and \nask what their favourite game is. Then they prepared a list.\n Navya is showing the list:\n She says (happily), “I have collected the data. I can figure out the \nmost popular game now!”.\n A few other children are looking at the list and wondering, “We \ncan’t yet see the most popular game. How can we get it from this list?”.\n Figure it Out\n1.  What would you do to find the most popular game among Naresh’s \nand Navya’s classmates?\n2.

It can be a fun activity in which they also learn about their classmates. Discuss how they can organise the data in different ways, each way having its own advantages and limitations. For all these tasks and the tasks under ‘Figure it Out’, discuss the tasks with the children and let them understand the tasks, and then let them plan and present their  research processes and conclusions in the class.Teacher’s Note\n4.2 Pictographs\nPictographs are one visual and suggestive way to represent data \nwithout writing any numbers. Look at this picture — you may be familiar with it from previous classes.  \n Modes of Travelling  Number of Students  = 1 Student\nPrivate car        \nPublic bus           \nSchool bus                      \nCycle       \nWalking               \n This picture helps you understand at a glance the different \nmod\nes of travel used by students. Based on this picture, answer the \nfollowing questions:\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   79 13/08/2024   15:33:12\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  80 •Which mode of travel is used by the most number of students? \n •Which mode of travel is used by the least number of students? \n A pictograph r\nepresents data through pictures of objects. It helps \nanswer questions about data with just a quick glance. \n In the above pictograph, one unit or symbol ( ) is used to represent \none student. There are also other pictographs where one unit or \nsymbol stands for many people or objects.\n Example: Nand Kishor collected responses from the children of \nhis middle school in Berasia regarding how often they slept at least 9 hours during the night. He prepared a pictograph from the data:\nResponse Number of Children (  = 10 Children)\nAlways         \nSometimes     \nNever        \nAnswer the following questions using the pictograph:\n1.  What is the number of children who always slept at least 9 hours at night? \n \n2.  How many children sometimes slept at least 9 hours at night?\n3. How many children always slept less than 9 hours each night? Explain how you got your answer\n.\nSolutions  \n1.   In the table, there are 5 pictures  for ‘Always’. Each picture \n represents 10 children. Therefore, 5 pictures indicate  \n5 × 10 = 50 children.\n2. There are 2 complete pictures  (2 × 10 = 20) and a half \npicture  (half of 10 = 5). Therefore, the number of children \nwho sleep at least 9 hours only sometimes is 20 + 5 = 25.\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   80 13/08/2024   15:33:12\nReprint 2025-26\n\nData Handling and Presentation813. There are 4 complete pictures for ‘Never’. Hence, 4 × 10 = \n40 children never sleep at least 9 hours in a night, i.e., they always sleep less than 9 hours.\nDrawing a Pictograph\nOne day, Lakhanpal collected data on how many students were absent in each class:\nClass I II III IV V VI VII VIII\nNo. of \nstudents3 5 4 2 0 1 5 7\n  He created a pictograph to present this data and decided to show \n1 student as  in the pictograph  —\nVIII\nVII\nVI\nV\nIV\nIII\nNo. of students absentClasses= 1 student\nII\nI\n Meanwhile, his friends Jarina and Sangita collected data on how \nmany students were present in each class:\nClass I II III IV V VI VII VIII\nNo. of \nstudents30 35 20 25 30 25 30 20\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   81 12-12-2024   10:48:23\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  82 If they want to show their data through a pictograph, where they \nalso use one symbol  for each student, as Lakhanpal did, what are \nthe challenges they might face? \n Jarina made a plan \nto address this — since there were many \nstudents, she decided to use  to represent 5 students. She figured \nthat would save time and space too.\nVIII\nVII\nVI\nV\nIV\nIII\nNo. of students presentClasses= 5 students\nII\nI\n Sangita decided to use one  to represent 10 students instead.\n Since she used one  to show 10 students, she had a problem in \nshowing 25 students and 35 students in the pictograph. Then, she \nrealised she could use to show 5 students.\nVIII\nVII\nVI\nV\nIV\nIII\nNo. of students presentClasses= 10 students\nII\nI\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   82 13/08/2024   15:33:12\nReprint 2025-26\n\nData Handling and Presentation83 What could be the problems faced in preparing such a \npictograph, if the total number of students present in a \nclass is 33 or 27?\n • Pictographs are a nice visual and suggestive way to represent \ndata. They represent data through pictures of objects. \n • Pictographs can help answer questions and make inferences \nabout data with just a quick glance (in the examples above— about favourite games, favourite colours, most common modes of conveyance, number of students absent, etc.). \n • By reading a pictograph, we can quickly understand the \nfrequencies of the different categories (for example, cricket, hockey, etc.) and the comparisons of these frequencies.\n • In a pictograph, the categories can be arranged horizontlly or \nvertically. For each category, simple pictures and symbols are then drawn in the designated columns or rows according to the frequency of that category. \n • A scale or key  (for example,  : 1 student or  : 5 students) \nis added to show what each symbol or picture represents. Each symbol or picture can represent one unit or multiple units.\n • It can be more challenging to prepare a pictograph when the \namount of data is large or when the frequencies are not exact multiples of the scale or key.\n Figure it Out  \n1.    The following pictograph shows the number of books borrowed \nby students, in a week, from the library of Middle School, Ginnori:Math \nTalk\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   83 14-08-2024   14:46:59\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  84Day Number of Books Borrowed ( =1 Book )\nMonday      \nTuesday     \nWednesday  \nThursday\nFriday      \nSaturday         \na.

How many symbols represent the kites that Rani purchased? \nb. Who purchased the maximum number of kites? \nc.  Who purchased more kites, Jasmeet or Chaman?\nd.  Rukhsana says Poonam Ben purchased more than double the \nnumber of kites that Rani purchased. Is she correct? Why?\n4.3 Bar Graphs\nHave you seen graphs \nlike this on TV or in a newspaper?\n Like pictographs, such \nbar graphs\n can help us to \nquickly understand and interpret information, such as the highest value, the comparison of values of different categories, etc. However, when the amount of data is large, presenting it by a pictograph is not only time consuming but at times difficult too. Let us see how data can be presented instead using a bar graph. \n Let’s take the data collected by Lakhanpal earlier, regarding the \nnumber of students absent on one da\ny in each class:\nClass I II III IV V VI VII VIII\nNo. of \nstudents3 5 4 2 0 1 5 7\nSource: https://www.statista.com/chart/17122/\nnumber-of-threatened-species-red-list/\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   85 12-12-2024   10:48:24\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  86 He presented the same data using a bar graph:\n \n1 unit length = 1 studentNumber of students\nClassNo. of students absent in each class\n12345678\n01 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nIf the students have not noticed, please point out the equally spaced \nhorizontal lines. Explain that this means that each pair of consecutive numbers on the left has the same gap. \nTeacher’s Note \n Answer the following questions using the bar graph:\n1. In Class 2, ___________ students were absent that day.\n2.  In which class were the maximum number of students absent? \n___________\n3. Which class had full attendance that day? ___________\n When making bar graphs, bars of uniform width can be drawn \nhorizontally or vertically with equal spacing between them; then the\n \nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   86 13/08/2024   15:33:14\nReprint 2025-26\n\nData Handling and Presentation87length or height of each bar represents the given number . As we saw in \npictographs, we can use a scale or key when the frequencies are larger . \n Let us look at \nan example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing \nin Delhi, which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day. The number of vehicles passing through the crossing each hour from 6 a.m. to 12:00 noon is shown in the bar graph. One unit of length stands for 100 vehicles.\n100\n600200\n700300\n800400\n900\n1100500\n1000\n1200Time intervals\nNumber of vehicles11–12\n10–11\n9–10\n8–9\n7–8\n6–7\n We can see that the maximum traffic at the crossing is shown \nby the longest bar, i.e., for the time interval 7–8 a.m. The bar gr\naph \nshows that 1200 vehicles passed through the crossing at that time. \nThe second longest bar is for 8–9 a.m. During that time, 1000 vehicles passed through the crossing. Similarly, the minimum traffic is shown by the smallest bar , i.e., the bar for the time interval 6–7 a.m. During that time, only about 150 vehicles passed through the crossing. The second smallest bar is that for the time interval 11 a.m.–12 noon, when about 600 vehicles passed through the crossing.\n The total number of cars passing through the crossing during the \ntwo-hour interval 8.00–10.00 a.m. as shown by the bar graph is about\n \n1000 + 800 = 1800 vehicles.\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   87 13/08/2024   15:33:14\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  88 Figure it Out\n1.  How many total cars passed through the crossing between 6 a.m. \nand noon?  \n2.  Why do you \nthink so little traffic occurred during the hour of \n6–7 a.m., as compared to the other hours from 7 a.m.–noon?\n3.  Why do you think the traffic was the heaviest between 7–8 a.m.?\n4. Why do you \nthink the traffic was lesser and lesser each hour after \n8 a.m. all the way until noon?\nExample:\nYearsPopulation of India in crores110\n36445468841021951\n1961\n1971\n1981\n1991\n2001100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n5040\n30\n20\n10\nPopulation of India in crores\nThis bar graph shows the population of India in each decade over a \nperiod of 50 years. The numbers are expressed in crores. If you were to take 1 unit length to represent one person, drawing the bars will \nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   88 13/08/2024   15:33:14\nReprint 2025-26\n\nData Handling and Presentation89be difficult! Therefore, we choose the scale so that 1 unit represents \n10 crores. The bar graph for this choice is shown in the figure. So a bar of length 5 units represents 50 crores and of 8 units represents 80 crores.\n •On the basis of this bar graph, what may be a few questions you \nmay ask your friends?\n •How much did the population of India increase over 50 years?  \nHow much did the population increase in each decade?\n4.4 Drawing a Bar Graph\nIn a previous example, Shri Nilesh prepared a frequency table representing the sweet preferences of the students in his class. Let’s try to prepare a bar graph to present his data —\n1.\n  First, we draw a horizontal \nline and a vertical line. On the horizontal line, we will\n \nwrite the name of each of the sweets, equally spaced, from which the bars will rise in accordance with their frequencies; and on the vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the number of students. \n2.\n We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many students will be represented b\ny a unit length of a bar so that \nit fits nicely on our paper . Here, we will take 1 unit length to represent 1 student. \n3.\n For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6\n \nunits (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly for the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their frequencies. Sweet No. of Students\nJalebi 6\nGulab jamun 9\nGujiya 13\nBarfi 3\nRasgulla 7\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   89 13/08/2024   15:33:14\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  904. We, therefore, get a bar graph as shown below —\nSweetsSweet preferences of students\n14\n1312\n1110\n98\n7\n65\n4\n3\n2\n10Number of students\nJalebi Gulab jamun Gujia  Barfi Rasgulla\n When the frequencies are larger and we cannot use the scale of \n1 unit length \n= 1 number (frequency), we need to choose a different \nscale like we did in the case of pictographs. \nExample: The number of runs scored by Smriti in each of the  \n8 matches are given in the table below:\nMatch Match \n1Match \n2Match \n3Match \n4Match \n5Match \n6Match \n7Match \n8\nRuns 80 50 10 100 90 0 90 50\n In this example, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score \nis 100. Using a scale of 1 unit length = l run would mean that we \nhave to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of l. This would\n \nbe unnecessarily tedious. Instead, let us use a scale where 1 unit length = 10 runs. We mark this scale on the vertical line and draw the bars according to the scores in each match. We get the following bar graph representing the above data.\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   90 13/08/2024   15:33:14\nReprint 2025-26\n\nData Handling and Presentation91Match 1 Match 2 Match 3 Match 4 Match 5 Match 6 Match 7 Match 8\nMatches100\n0102030405060708090RunsRuns scored by Smriti\nExample:  The following table shows the monthly expenditure of \nImran’s family on various items:\nItems Expenditure (in ` )\nHouse rent\nFoodEducationElectricityTransportMiscellaneous30003400\n 800 400 600\n 1200\n To represent this data in the form of a bar graph, here are the steps  —\n •Draw two perpendicular lines, one horizontal and one vertical. \n •Along the horizontal line, mark the ‘items’ with equal spacing \nbetween them and mark the corresponding expenditures along \nthe vertical line.\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   91 12-12-2024   10:48:24\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  92 • Take bars of the same width, keeping a uniform gap between them. \n • Choose a suitable scale along the vertical line. Let, 1 unit length =  \n` 200, and then mark and write the corresponding values (`  200, \n` 400, etc.) representing each unit length.\n Finally, calculate the heights of the bars for various items as \nshown below — \nHouse rent\nFood\nEducation\nElectricity\nTransport\nMiscellaneous3000 ÷ 200\n3400 ÷ 200\n 800 ÷ 200\n 400 ÷ 200\n 600 ÷ 200\n 1200 ÷ 20015 units\n17 units\n4 units2 units3 units6 units\n Here is the bar graph that we obtain based on the above steps:\nExpenditure ( in ` )\nHouse rent\nEducation\nElectricity\nTransport\nMiscellaneousFood3600\n3400\n3200\n3000\n2800\n2600\n2400\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\nItem\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   92 13/08/2024   15:33:14\nReprint 2025-26\n\nData Handling and Presentation93 Use the bar graph to answer the following questions:\n1.

Project Tiger was launched in 1973 to track and protect the tigers in India. Starting in 2006, the exact number of tigers in India was tracked. Shagufta and Divya looked up information about the number of tigers in India between 2006 and 2022 in four-year intervals. They prepared a frequency table for this data and a bar graph to present this data, but there are a few mistakes in the graph. Can you find those mistakes and fix them?\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   99 12-12-2024   10:48:25\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  100Year Number of Tigers \n(approx.)\n2006 1400\n2010 17002014 22002018 30002022 3700Number of Tigers in IndiaYear\nNumber of Tigers2022\n2018\n2014\n2010\n2006\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000\n•  Like pictographs, bar graphs give a nice visual way to represent \ndata. They represent data through \nequally-spaced bars, each of \nequal width, where the lengths or heights give frequencies of the different categories. \n•\n  Each category is represented \nby a bar where the length or height \ndepicts the corresponding frequency (for example, cost) or quantity (for example, runs). \n•\n  The bars have uniform \nspaces between them to indicate that they \nare free standing and represent equal categories.\n•  The bars help in \ninterpreting data much faster than a frequency \ntable. By reading a bar graph, we can compare frequencies of different categories at a glance.\n•\n  We must decide \nthe scale (for example,  1 unit length = 1 student \nor 1 unit length = `  200) for a bar graph on the basis of the data \nincluding the minimum and maximum frequencies, so that the resulting bar graph fits nicely and looks visually appealing on the paper or poster we are preparing. The markings of the unit lengths as per the scale must start from zero.\nTeacher’s Note \nThe main focus of this chapter is to learn how to handle data to find \nanswers to specific questions or inquiries, to test hypotheses or to take specific decisions. This should be kept in mind when providing practice opportunities to collect, organise and analyse data. \nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   100 13/08/2024   15:33:28\nReprint 2025-26\n\nData Handling and Presentation1014.5 Artistic and Aesthetic Considerations\nIn addition to the steps described in previous sections, there are \nalso some other more artistic and aesthetic aspects one can consider when preparing visual presentations of data to make them more interesting and effective. First, when making a visual presentation of data such as a pictograph or bar graph, it is important to make it fit in the intended space; this can be controlled, for example, by choosing the scale appropriately, as we have seen earlier . It is also desirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and easy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the information being conveyed.\n Let us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest \nmountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain in meters.\nContinent AsiaSouth \nAmericaNorth \nAmericaAfrica Europe Antarctica Australia\nTallest \nMountainEverest Aconcagua DenaliKiliman-\njaro ElbrusVinson \nMassifKoscuiszko\nHeight 8848m 6962m 6194m 5895m 5642m 4892m 2228m\n How much taller is Mount Everest than Mount Koscuiszko? Are \nMount \nDenali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This \nis not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers.\n As we have seen earlier , we can convert the table of numbers \ninto a bar graph, as shown on the right.  Here, each value is dr\nawn \nas a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the number they represent. This makes it easier to compare the heights of all these mountains at a glance.\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   101 13/08/2024   15:33:28\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  102Asia — Everest \nSouth America — Aconcagua   \nNorth America — Denali\nAfrica — Kilimanjaro \nEurope — Elbrus\nAntarctica — Vinson Massif \nAustralia — Koscuiszko\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000\n However , since the boxes represent heights, it is better and more \nvisually appealing to rotate the picture, so that \nthe boxes grow \nupward, vertically from the ground like mountains. A bar graph \nwith vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the pillars you find in a building that hold up the roof. \n Below is a column \ngraph for our table of tallest mountains. From \nthis column graph, it becomes easier to compare and visualise the heights of the mountains. \n010000\n9000\n8000\n7000\n6000\n5000\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\nAsia  \nEverest \nSouth America  \nAconcagua   North America  \nDenaliAfrica  \nKilimanjaro Europe  \nElbrus Antarctica  \nVinson Massif Australia  \nKoscuiszko\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   102 13/08/2024   15:33:28\nReprint 2025-26\n\nData Handling and Presentation103 In general, it is more intuitive, suggestive and visually appealing \nto represent heights, that are measured upwards from the ground, \nusing bar graphs that have vertical bars or columns. Similarly, lengths that are parallel to the ground (for example, distances between location on Earth) are usually best represented using bar graphs with horizontal arcs. \n Figure it Out\n1. If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the \ntallest persons in \neach class in your school, would you use a graph \nwith vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why?\n2.  If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent and their lengths, \nwould you prefer to use a bar graph with \nvertical bars or with horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this information, and then make the corresponding table and bar graph! Which continents have the longest rivers?\nInfographics\nWhen data visualisations such as bar graphs are further beautified \nwith more extensive artistic and visual imagery, they are called information graphics or infographics for short.  The aim of infographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging visuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly, in a visually pleasing way. \n As an example of how infographics can be used to communicate \ndata even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing\n \nthe tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with vertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more indicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use triangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a splash of colour as well. Here is the result.\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   103 13/08/2024   15:33:28\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  1048000m\n7000m6000m5000m4000m3000m2000m1000m\nEverest\n8848m\n AsiaAconcagua\n6962m\nS AmericaDenali\n6194m \nNorth \nAmericaKilimanjaro \n5895m\nAfricaElbrus\n5642m\nEuropeVinson Massif\n4892m  \nAntarcticaKoscuiszk o\n2228m\nA\nustralia\n While this infographic might look more appealing and suggestive at \nfirst glance, it \ndoes have some issues. The goal of our bar graph earlier \nwas to represent the heights of various mountains — using bars of the \nappropriate heights but the same widths. The purpose of using the same widths was to make it clear that we are only comparing heights. However , in this infographic, the taller triangles are also wider! Are taller mountains always wider? The infographic is implying additional information that may be misleading and may or may not be correct.  Sometimes going for more appealing pictures can also accidentally mislead.\n Taking this idea further\n, and to make the picture even more visually \nstimulating and suggestive, we can further change the shapes of the mountains to make them look even more like mountains, and add other details, while attempting to preserve the heights. For example, we can create an imaginary mountain range that contains all these mountains.\n Is the infographic below better than the column graph with \nrectangular columns of equal width? The mountains look more realistic, but is the picture accurate? \n For example, Everest appears to be twice as tall as Elbrus.\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   104 13/08/2024   15:33:28\nReprint 2025-26\n\nData Handling and Presentation105\nThe seven highest peaks on \nthe seven continents.\n What is 5642 ×  2? \n While preparing visually-appealing presentations of data, we \nalso need to be careful that the pictures we draw do not mislead us \nabout the facts. In gener\nal, it is important to be careful when making \nor reading infographics, so that we do not mislead our intended audiences and we, ourselves, are not misled. \nSummary\n \u001fFacts, numbers, measures, observations and other descriptions of \nthings that convey information about those things is called data.\n \u001fData can be organised in a tabular form using tally marks for easy analysis and interpretation. \n \u001fFrequencies are the counts of the occurrences of values, measures or observations.\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   105 13/08/2024   15:33:39\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6  106 \u001fPictographs represent data in the form of pictures, or objects or parts \nof objects. Each picture represents a frequency which can be 1 or more than 1 — this is called the scale and it must be specified. \n \u001fBar graphs have bars of uniform width; the length or height that \nindicates the total frequency of occurrence. The scale that is used to convert length or height to frequency again, must be specified. \n \u001fChoosing the appropriate scale for a pictograph or bar graph is important to accurately and effectively convey the desired information or data and to also make it visually appealing.\n \u001fOther aspects of a graph also contribute to its effectiveness and visual appeal such as how colours are used, what accompanying pictures are drawn, and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical. These aspects correspond to the artistic and aesthetic side of data handling and presentation. \n \u001fHowever , making visual representations of data ‘fancy’ can also sometimes be misleading.\n \u001fBy reading pictographs and bar graphs accurately, we can quickly understand and make inferences about the data presented.\nChapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   106 13/08/2024   15:33:39\nReprint 2025-26\n"}

Guna can arrange 12 figs in a rectangular manner. \n 2. Anshu can arrange 7 figs in a rectangular manner. \nGuna has listed out these possibilities.Observe the number of rows and \ncolumns in each of the arr\nangements. \nHow are they related to 12?\nIn the second arrangement, for \nexample, 12 figs are arranged in two columns of 6 each or 12 =  2 × 6.\nAnshu could make only one \narrangement: 7 × 1 or 1 × 7. There are \nno other rectangular arrangements possible.\nIn each of Guna’s arrangements, \nmultiplying the number of rows by the number of columns gives the number 12. So, the number of rows or columns are factors of 12.\nWe saw that the number 12 can be arranged in a rectangle in \nmore than one way as 12 has more than two factors. The number 7 can be arranged in only one way, as it has only two factors\n — 1 and 7.\nNumbers that have only two factors are called prime numbers\n or \nprimes. Here are the first few primes  — 2, 3, 5, 7, \n11, 13, 17, 19. Notice \nthat the factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself.\nWhat about numbers that have more than two factors? They \nare called composite numbers. The first few composite numbers are\n — 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20.\nChapter 5_Prime Time.indd   112 13-08-2024   17:20:36\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPrime Time 113What about 1, which has only one factor? The number 1 is neither \na prime nor a composite number.\n How many prime numbers are there from 21 to 30? How many \ncomposite numbers are there from 21 to 30?\nCan we list all the prime numbers from 1 to 100?\nHere \nis an interesting way to find prime numbers. Just follow the \nsteps given below and see what happens.\nStep 1: Cross out 1 because it is neither prime nor composite.\nStep 2: Circle 2, and then cross out all multiples of 2 after that, i.e., 4, 6, 8, and so on.Step 3: You will find that the next uncrossed number is 3. Circle 3 and then cross out all the multiples of 3 after that, i.e., 6, 9, 12, and so on.Step 4: The next uncrossed number is 5. Circle 5 and then cross out all the multiples of 5 after that, i.e., 10, 15, 20, and so on.Step 5: Continue this process till all the numbers in the list are either circled or crossed out.\nAll the circled numbers are prime \nnumbers. All the crossed out numbers, other than 1, are composite numbers. This method is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\nThis procedure can be carried on \nfor numbers greater than 100 also. Eratosthenes was a Greek mathematician who lived around 2200 years ago and developed this method of listing primes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\n31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50\n51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\n61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70\n71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80\n81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90\n91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100\nIt is definitely not some  \nmagic; there should be a  \nreason why it works.\nChapter 5_Prime Time.indd   113 13-08-2024   17:20:36\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6114Guna and Anshu started wondering how this simple method is able \nto find prime numbers! Think how this method works. Read the steps \ngiven above again and see what happens after each step is carried out.\n Figure it Out\n1.  We see that 2 is a prime and also an even number. Is there any \nother even prime?\n2.  Look at the list of primes till 100. What is the \nsmallest difference \nbetween two successive primes? What is the largest difference?\n3.  Are there an equal number of primes occurring in every row in the table on the previous page? Which decades have the least number \nof primes? Which have the most number of primes?\nPrimes through the Ages\nPrime numbers are the building blocks of all whole numbers. Starting from the time of the Greek civilisation (more than 2000 years ago) to this day, mathematicians are still struggling to uncover their secrets!\nFood for thought: is there a largest prime number? Or does the \nlist of prime numbers go on without an end? A mathematician named Euclid found the answer and so will you in a later class!\nFun fact: The largest prime number that anyone has ‘written down’ \nis so large that it would take around 6500 pages to write it! So they could only write it on a computer!\n4.  Which of the following numbers are prime: 23, 51, 37, 26?\n5.  Write three pairs of prime numbers less than 20 whose sum is a multiple of 5.\n6. \n The numbers 13 and \n31 are prime numbers. Both these numbers have \nsame digits 1 and 3. Find such pairs of prime numbers up to 100.\n7. Find seven consecutive composite numbers between 1 and 100.\n8. Twin primes are pairs of primes having a difference of 2. For\n \nexample, 3 and 5 are twin primes. So are 17 and 19. Find the other twin primes between 1 and 100.\nChapter 5_Prime Time.indd   114 13-08-2024   17:20:37\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPrime Time 1159.

Find at least five such examples.\n5.3 Co-prime numbers for safekeeping treasures\nWhich pairs are safe?\nLet us go back to the treasure finding game. This time, treasures are \nkept on two numbers. Jumpy gets the treasures only if he is able to reach both the numbers with the same jump size. There is also a new rule\n — a jump size of 1 is not allowed.\n Where should Grumpy place the treasures so that Jumpy cannot \nreach both the treasures?\nWill placing \nthe treasure on 12 and 26 work? No! If the jump size \nis chosen to be 2, then Jumpy will reach both 12 and 26.\nWhat about 4 and 9? Jumpy cannot reach both using any jump size \nother than 1. So, Grumpy knows that the pair 4 and 9 is safe.\nCheck if these pairs are safe:\na. 15 and 39  b. 4 and 15 \nc. 18 and 29  d. 20 and 55\nChapter 5_Prime Time.indd   115 14-08-2024   14:53:54\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6116What is special about safe pairs? They don’t have any common \nfactor other than 1. Two numbers are said to be co-prime to each \nother if they have no common factor other than 1.\nExample: As 15 and 39 have 3 as a common factor, they are not  \nco-prime.

Let us check.\nAnshu:   I can write 56 = 14 \n× 4 and 63 =  21 × 3. So, 14 and 4 \nare factors, of 56. Further, 21 and 3 are factors of \n63. So, there are no common factors. The numbers are co-prime.\nGuna:\n  Hold on. I can \nalso write 56 = 7 × 8 and 63 =  9 × 7. \nWe see that 7 is a factor of both numbers, so, they are not co-prime.\nClearly Guna is right, as 7 is a common factor. \n But where did Anshu go wrong? \nWriting 56 = 14 × 4 tells us that 14 and 4 are both factors of 56, but it \ndoes not tell all the factors of 56. The same holds for the factors of 63.\nTry another example: 80 and 63. There are many ways to factorise \nboth numbers.\n80 = 40 ×  2 = 20 × 4 =  10 ×  8 = 16 ×  5 = ???\n63 = 9 × 7 = 3 × 21 =  ???\nWe have written ‘???’ to say that there may be more ways to \nfactorise these numbers. But if we take any of the given factorisations, for example, 80 =  16 × 5 and 63 =  9 × 7, then there are no common \nfactors. Can we conclude that 80 and 63 are co-prime? As Anshu’s mistake above shows, we cannot conclude that as there may be other ways to factorise the numbers.\nWhat this means is that we need a more systematic approach to \ncheck if two numbers are co-prime.\nChapter 5_Prime Time.indd   117 13-08-2024   17:20:37\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6118Prime factorisation\nTake a number such as 56. It is composite, as we saw that it can be \nwritten as 56 = 4 × 14 . So, both 4 and 14 are factors of 56. Now take one of these, say 14. It is also composite and can be written as 14 = 2 ×\n 7. \nTherefore, 56 = 4 × 2 × 7. Now, 4 is composite and can be written as  \n4 =\n 2 × 2. Therefore, 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7. All the factors appearing here, 2 \nand 7, are prime numbers. So, we cannot divide them further.\nIn conclusion, we have written 56 as a product of prime numbers. \nThis is called prime factorisation of 56. The individual factors are \ncalled prime factors . For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7.\nEvery number greater than 1 has a prime factorisation. The idea \nis the same: keep breaking the composite numbers into factors till only primes are left.\nThe number 1 does not have any prime factorisation. It is not \ndivisible by any prime number.\nWhat is the prime factorisation of a prime number like 7? It is just \n7 (we cannot break it down any further).\nLet us see a few more examples.By going through different ways of breaking down the number, \nwe wrote 63 as 3 ×  3 × 7 and as 3 × 7 × 3. Are they different? Not \nreally! The same prime numbers 3 and 7 occur in both cases. Further, 3 appears two times in both and 7 appears once.\nHere, you see four \ndifferent ways to get prime factorisation of 36. Observe that in all four cases, we get two 2s and two 3s.\nMultiply back to see \nthat you get 36 in all four cases.\nFor any number, it is a remarkable fact that there is only one prime \nfactorisation, except that the prime factors may come in different 36\n2×18 3×12 4×9 6 ×6\n2×2×9 3 ×3×4 2 ×2×9 2 ×3×6\n2×2×3×3 3×3×2×2 2×2×3×3 2×3×2×3\n2×3×2×3 2×2×3×3\nChapter 5_Prime Time.indd   118 13-08-2024   17:20:37\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPrime Time 119orders. As we explain below, the order is not important. However, \nas we saw in these examples, there are many ways to arrive at the prime factorisation!\nDoes the order matter? \nUsing this diagram,\ncan you explain why 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, no matter which way you multiply 2, 3, and 5?\nWhen multiplying numbers, we can do so in any order. The \nend result is the same. That is why, when two 2s and two 3s are multiplied in any order, we get 36. In a later class, we shall study this under the names of commutativity and associativity of multiplication. \nThus, the order does not matter. Usually we write the prime \nnumbers in increasing order. For example, 225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 or 30 = \n2 × 3 × 5.\nPrime factorisation of a product of two numbers\nWhen we find the prime factorisation of a number, we first write it as a product of two factors. For example, 72 =  12 ×  6. Then, we \nfind the prime factorisation of each of the factors. In the above example, 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 and 6 = 2 × 3. Now, can you say what the prime factorisation \nof 72 is?\nThe prime factorisation of the original number is obtained by \nputting these together.\n72 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 3\nChapter 5_Prime Time.indd   119 13-08-2024   17:20:37\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6120We can also write this as 2 ×  2 × 2 × 3 × 3. Multiply and check that \nyou get 72 back!\nObserve how many times each prime factor occurs in the \nfactorisation of 72.\nCompare it with how many times it occurs in the factorisations of \n12 and 6 put together.\n Figure it Out\n1. Find the prime factorisations of the following numbers: 64, 104, \n105, 243, 320, 141, 1728, 729, 1024, 1331, 1000.\n2. The prime factorisation of a number has one 2, two 3s, and one 11. What is the number?\n3.\n Find three prime numbers, \nall less than 30, whose product is 1955.\n4. Find the prime factorisation of these numbers without multiplying first\n \n a. 56 × 25 b. 108 ×  75 c. 1000 ×  81\n5. What is the smallest number whose prime factorisation has:\n a. three different prime numbers?  \n b. four different prime numbers? \nPrime factorisation is of fundamental importance in the study of \nnumbers. Let us discuss two ways in which it can be useful.\nUsing prime factorisation to check if two numbers are co-prime\n Let us again take the numbers 56 and 63. How can we check if they \nare co-prime? We can use the prime factorisation of both numbers  —\n56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 and 63 \n= 3 × 3 × 7\nNow, we see that 7 is a prime factor of 56 as well as 63. Therefore, \n56 and 63 are not co-prime.\nWhat about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows:\n80 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 63 =  3 × 3 × 7\nThere are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they \nare co-prime? Suppose they have a common factor that is composite. Would the prime factors of this composite common factor appear in the prime factorisation of 80 and 63?\nChapter 5_Prime Time.indd   120 13-08-2024   17:20:37\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPrime Time 121Therefore, we can say that if there are no common prime factors, \nthen the two numbers are co-prime.\nLet us see some examples.\nExample:  Consider 40 and 231. Their prime factorisations are as \nfollows:\n40 = 2 × 2 × 2 \n× 5 and 231 =  3 × 7 × 11\nWe see that there are no common primes that divide both 40 and \n231. Indeed, the prime factors of 40 are 2 and 5 while, the prime factors of 231 are 3, 7, and 11. Therefore, 40 and 231 are co-prime!\nExample:  \n Consider 242 and 195. Their prime factorisations are as \nfollows:\n242 = 2 × 11 ×  11 and 195 \n= 3 × 5 × 13\nThe prime factors of 242 are 2 and 11. The prime factors of 195 \nare 3, 5, and 13. There are no common prime factors. Therefore, 242 and 195 are co-prime.\nUsing prime factorisation to check if one number is divisible \nby another\nWe can say that if one number is divisible by another, the prime \nfactorisation of the second number is included in the prime factorisation of the first number.\nWe say that 48 is divisible by 12 because when we divide 48 by 12, \nthe remainder is zero. How can we check if one number is divisible by another without carrying out long division?\nExample: Is 168 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:\n168 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 =  2 × 2 × 3\nSince we can multiply in any order, now it is clear that,\n 168 =  2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 7 = 12 ×  14\nTherefore, 168 is divisible by 12.\nExample:  Is 75 divisible by 21? Find the prime factorisations of both:\n75 = 3 × 5 × 5 and 21 =  3 × 7\nChapter 5_Prime Time.indd   121 13-08-2024   17:20:37\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6122As we saw in the discussion above, if 75 was a multiple of 21, then \nall prime factors of 21 would also be prime factors of 75. However, 7 \nis a prime factor of 21 but not a prime factor of 75. Therefore, 75 is not divisible by 21.\nExample: Is 42 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:\n42 = 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 =  2 × 2 × 3\nAll prime factors of 12 are also prime factors of 42. But the prime \nfactorisation of 12 is not included in the prime factorisation of 42. \nThis is because 2 occurs twice in the prime factorisation of 12 but only once in the prime factorisation of 42. This means that 42 is not divisible by 12.\nWe can say that if one number is divisible by another, then the \nprime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime factorisation of the first number.\n Figure it Out  \n1.

Guna says, “Any two prime numbers are co-prime?”. Is he right?\n5.5 Divisibility Tests\nSo far, we have been finding factors of numbers in different contexts, \nincluding to determine if a number is prime or not, or if a given pair of numbers is co-prime or not.\nChapter 5_Prime Time.indd   122 13-08-2024   17:20:37\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPrime Time 123It is easy to find factors of small numbers. How do we find factors \nof a large number?\nLet us take 8560. Does it have any factors from 2 to 10 (2, 3, 4,  \n5, ..., 9, 10)?\nIt is easy to check if some of these numbers are factors or not \nwithout doing long division. Can you find them?\nDivisibility by 10\nLet us take 10. Is 8560 divisible by 10? This is another way of  \nasking if 10 is a factor of 8560.\nFor this, we can look at the pattern in the multiples of 10.\nThe first few \nmultiples of 10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, … Continue this \nsequence and observe the pattern.\nIs 125 a multiple of 10?

The \nmultiples of 10, 5 and 2 have a pattern in their last digits which we are able to use to check for divisibility. Similarly, can we check if a number is divisible by 4 by looking at the last digit?\nIt does not work! Look at 12 and 22. They have the same last digit, \nbut 12 is a multiple of 4 while 22 is not. Similarly 14 and 24 have the same last digit, but 14 is not a multiple of 4 while 24 is. Similarly, 16 and 26 or 18 and 28. What this means is that by looking at the last digit, we cannot tell whether a number is a multiple of 4.\nCan we answer the question by looking at more digits? Make a list \nof multiples of 4 between 1 and 200 and search for a pattern.\n Find numbers between 330 and 340 that are divisible by 4. Also, \nfind numbers between 1730 \nand 1740, and 2030 and 2040, that are \ndivisible by 4. What do you observe?\n Is 8536 divisible by 4?\n Consider these statements:\n1.

For a polygon, i.e., \na closed plane figure made up of line segments, the perimeter is \nsimply the sum of the lengths of its all sides, i.e., the total distance along its outer boundary.\n The perimeter of a \npolygon = the sum of the lengths of its all sides.\n Let us revise the \nformulas for the perimeter of rectangles, squares, \nand triangles.\nPerimeter of a rectangle\nConsider a rectangle ABCD whose length and breadth are 12 cm and 8 cm, respectively. What is its perimeter? \nPerimeter of the rectangle = \n Sum of the lengths of its four sides\n    \n   = AB + BC + CD + DA \nA 12 cm B8 cm\nD CPERIMETER AND AREA 6\nChapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd   129 13-08-2024   16:16:29\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6130    = AB + BC + AB + BC \n    = 2 × AB + 2 × BC\n    = 2 × (AB + BC) \n    = 2 × (12 cm + 8 cm)  \n    = 2 × (20 cm) \n    = 40 cm.\nFrom this example, we see that  —\nPerimeter of a rectangle = length + breadth + length + breadth.\nPerimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth).\n The perimeter of a \nrectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth.\nPerimeter of a square \nDebojeet wants to put coloured tape all around \na square photo frame of side 1m as shown. What will be the length of the coloured tape he requires? Since Debojeet wants to put the coloured tape all around the square photo frame, he needs to find the perimeter of the photo frame. \n Thus, the length of \nthe tape required = \nperimeter of the square \n = sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square \n = 1 m + 1 m + 1 m + 1 m = 4 m.\n Now, we know \nthat all four sides of a square are equal in length. \nTherefore, in place of adding the lengths of each side, we can simply multiply the length of one side by 4. \n   Thus, the length of the tape required = 4 × 1 m = 4 m. \n From this example, we see that\nPerimeter of a square = 4 × length of a side.\n The perimeter of a square is quadruple the length of its side.Opposite sides of a \nrectangle are always \nequal. So, AB = CD and \nAD = BC\n1 m\nChapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd   130 13-08-2024   16:16:29\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPerimeter and Area131Perimeter of a triangle\nConsider a triangle having three given sides of  \nlengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 7 cm. Find its perimeter. \nPerimeter of the triangle = 4 cm + 5 cm + 7 cm\n     \n    = 16 cm.\nPerimeter of a triangle = sum of the lengths of its three sides.  \nExample: Akshi wants to put lace all around a \nrectangular tablecloth that is 3 m long and 2  m \nwide. Find the length of the lace required.\nSolution\n  Length of the rectangular table cover = 3 m.\n  Breadth of the rectangular table cover = 2 m.\n  Akshi wants to put lace all around the \ntablecloth. \n  Therefore, the length of the \nlace required will be the perimeter of the \nrectangular tablecloth.\n  Now, the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth  = 2 × (length + \nbreadth) \n     \n        = 2 × (3 m + 2 m) \n             = 2 × 5 m = 10 m.\n  Hence, the length of the lace required is 10 m.\nExample: Find the distance travelled by Usha if she takes three rounds of \na square park of side 75 m.\nSolution\n  Perimeter of the square park = 4 × length of a side = 4 × 75 m = 300 m.\n  Distance covered by Usha in one  \nround = 300 m. \n  Therefore, the total distance travelled by Usha in three rounds = 3 × 300 m = 900 m.5 cm 4 cm \n7 cm \nChapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd   131 12-12-2024   11:04:16\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6132 Figure it Out\n1.

Do you remember?\nArea of a square =  ________  Area of a rectangle =  _______\nTeacher’s Note \nHelp students in recalling the method of finding the area of a \nrectangle and a square using grid papers. Provide square grid papers to students and let them come up with the formula.\n Let’s see some real-life problems related to these ideas.\nExample: A floor is 5 m long and 4 m wide. A square carpet of sides 3 m \nis laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor that is not carpeted.\nSolution\nLength of the floor = 5 m.\nWidth of the floor = 4 m.Area of the floor = length × width = 5 m × 4 m = 20 sq m.Length of the square carpet = 3 m.Area of the carpet = length × length = 3 m × 3 m = 9 sq m.Hence, the area of the floor laid with carpet is 9 sq m.\n Therefore, the area of \nthe floor that is not carpeted is: area of the floor \nminus the area of the floor laid with carpet = 20 sq m – 9 sq m = 11 sq m.\nExample:  Four square flower beds each of side 4 m are in four corners \non a piece of land 12 m long and 10 m wide.

No, 4 is a common factor \nof 16 and 20. Let us reduce 1620 to lowest terms. \nWe know that both 16 (numerator) and 20 (denominator) are \ndivisible by 4. \nSo, 16 ÷ 4\n20 ÷ 4 = 45.     \nNow,\u0007there\u0007is\u0007no\u0007common \u0007factor\u0007between\u00074\u0007and\u00075.\u0007Hence,\u00071620 \nexpressed in lowest terms is 45. So, 45 is called the simplest form of 1620, \nsince 4 and 5 have no common factor other than 1.\nAny fraction can be converted to \nlowest terms by dividing both the \nnumerator and denominator by the \nhighest common factor between \nthem. \nChapter 7_Fractions.indd   172 13-08-2024   15:39:46\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFractions173Expressing a fraction in lowest terms can also be done in steps. \nSuppose we want to express 36\n60 in lowest terms. First, we notice \nthat both the numerator and denominator are even. So, we divide \nboth by 2, and see that 36\n60 =  1830.\nBoth the numerator and denominator are even again, so we can \ndivide them each by 2 again; we get  1830 = 9\n15. \nWe now notice that 9 and 15 are both multiples of 3, so we divide \nboth by 3 to get  9\n15 = 35. \nNow, 3 and 5 have no common factor other than 1, so,  3660 in lowest \nterms is 35.\nAlternatively, we could have noticed that in 3660 , both the numerator \nand denominator are multiples of 12 : we see that 36 = 3 × 12 and  \n60 = 5 × 12. Therefore, we could have concluded that  3660 = 35 straight away.\nEither method works and will give the same answer!

It was \ncalled bhinna in Sanskrit, which means ‘broken’. It was also called \nbhaga or ansha meaning ‘part’ or ‘piece’. \nThe way we write fractions today, globally, originated in India. In \nancient Indian mathematical texts, such as the Bakshali manuscript  \n(from around the year 300 CE), when they wanted to write 1\n2, they \nwrote it as 12 which is indeed very similar to the way we write it \ntoday! This method of writing and working with fractions continued \nto be used in India for the next several centuries, including by Aryabhata (499 CE), Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya (c.\n 750 CE), and Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), among others. The line \nsegment between the numer\nator and denominator in ‘1\n2’ and in other \nChapter 7_Fractions.indd   182 13-08-2024   15:39:48\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFractions183fractions was later introduced by the Moroccan mathematician  \nAl-Hassar \u0007(in\u0007the\u000712th\u0007century). \u0007Over\u0007the\u0007next\u0007few\u0007centuries \u0007the\u0007\nnotation then spread to Europe and around the world.\nFractions had also been used in other cultures such as the ancient \nEgyptian and \nBabylonian civilisations, but they primarily used only \nfractional units, that is, fractions with a 1 in the numerator. More \ngeneral fractions were expressed as sums of fractional units, now called ‘Egyptian fractions’. Writing numbers as the sum of fractional \nunits, e.g., \n19\n24 = 12 + 16 + 18, can be quite an art and leads to beautiful \npuzzles. We will consider one such puzzle below. \nGeneral fractions (where the numerator is not necessarily 1) \nwere\u0007first\u0007introduced \u0007in\u0007India,\u0007along\u0007with\u0007their\u0007rules\u0007of\u0007arithmetic \u0007\noperations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even\n \ndivision of fractions. The ancient Indian treatises called the ‘Sulba-\nsutras’ shows that even during  Vedic times, Indians had discovered the rules for operations with fractions. General rules and procedures for\n\u0007working\u0007with\u0007and\u0007computing \u0007with\u0007fractions \u0007were\u0007first\u0007codified\u0007\nformally and in a modern form by Brahmagupta. \nBr\nahmagupta’s methods for working with and computing with \nfractions are still what we use today. For example, Brahmagupta described how to add and subtract fractions as follows:\n“By the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator \nof each of the fractions by the other denominators, the fractions are reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition, the numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added. In case of subtraction, their difference is taken.’’ (Brahmagupta, Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta,\n\u0007Verse\u000712.2,\u0007628\u0007CE)\nThe Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were \ntr\nansmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and \nthey came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century and then spread worldwide.\nChapter 7_Fractions.indd   183 13-08-2024   15:39:48\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6184 Puzzle!\n  It is easy to add up fractional units to obtain the sum 1, if one \nuses the same fractional unit, for example, \n 1\n2 + 12 = 1,  13 + 13 + 13 = 1,  14 + 14 + 14 + 14 = 1, etc. \n   However, can you think of a way to add fractional units that \nare all different to get 1?\n   It is not possible to \nadd two different fractional units to get 1. \nThe reason is that 12 is the largest fractional unit, and 12 + 12 = 1. \n   To get different fractional units, we would have to replace at \nleast one of the 12’s with some smaller fractional unit - but then \nthe sum would be less than 1!

The only way to increase \n13 to another fractional unit is to replace it by 12. So 12 must be one of \nthe fractional units.\nNow 12 + 14 + 14 = 1.

What does your \nintuition say? Discuss with your classmates.\nNow, verify your guesses by placing the points X and Y on the \nsides and measure how near or far they are.\nThe distance between X and Y can be obtained by measuring the \nlength of the line XY.\nHow does the minimum distance between the points X and Y \ncompare to the length of AB?\nChange the positions of X and Y to check if there are other \npositions where they are at their nearest or farthest. You could construct multiple copies of the rectangle and try out various positions of X and Y.\nHow will you keep track of the lengths XY for different positions \nof X and Y?\nHere is one way of doing it. Suppose here are some of the positions \nof X and Y that you have considered:\n• When X is 5 mm away from A and Y is 3 cm away from B,  \nXY = ___ cm __ mm\n• When X is 1 cm away from A and Y is 1 cm away from B,  \nXY = ___ cm ___ mm\n• When X is 2 cm away from A and Y is 4 cm away from B,  \nXY = ___ cm ___ mm and so on.\n Is there a shorthand way of writing it down?

This is written as  —\n AF = AB = BE = FE\n BE = BC = CD = ED\n So, all the shorter lines are equal!\n  A convention is followed \nto represent equal sides. It is done by \nputting a  ‘|’ on the line. Refer to the rough figure.\n  Using this analysis, can \nyou try constructing it? Remember, all \nthat was asked for is a rectangle that can be divided into two identical squares and with no measurements imposed.\n  To draw \nthe rectangle ACDF, one could assign any length to AF. For \nexample, if we assign AF = 4 cm, then what must the length of AC be?\n  Explore: Can the rectangle now be completed?\n  In fact, one could \nproceed by drawing AF without even \nmeasuring its length using a ruler. We could then construct a line perpendicular to AF that is long enough to contain the other side. As, AB = AF, we need to somehow transfer the length of AF \nChapter 8_Playing with Constructions.indd   200 13-08-2024   16:39:02\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPlaying with Constructions201to get the point B.

Let us understand this by labeling some points on the figure.\nThe figure shows a square with its corners labeled A, B, C and D. \nLet us first consider the vertical line of symmetry. When we reflect \nChapter 9_Symmetry.indd   221 13-08-2024   17:05:25\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6222the square along this line, the points B, C on the right get reflected to \nthe left side and occupy the positions occupied earlier by A, D. What happens to the points A, D? A occupies the position occupied by B and D that of C!\nA\nDB\nC\n What if we reflect along the diagonal from A to C? Where do \npoints A, B, \nC and D go? What if we reflect along the horizontal line of \nsymmetry?A figure that has a line or lines of symmetry is thus, also said to have reflection symmetry.\nGenerating shapes having lines of symmetry\nSo far we have seen symmetrical figures and asymmetrical  \nfigures. How does one generate such symmetrical figures? Let us explore this.\nInk Blot Devils\nYou enjoyed doing this earlier in Class 5. Take a piece of paper. Fold it in half. Open the paper and spill a few drops of ink (or paint) on one half.\nNow press the halves together and then open the paper again.\n•\n What do you see?\n• Is the resulting figure symmetric?\n• If yes, where is the line of symmetry?\n• Is there any other line along which it can be folded to produce two identical parts?\n•\n Try making more such patterns.\nChapter 9_Symmetry.indd   222 13-08-2024   17:05:25\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSymmetry223Paper Folding and Cutting \nHere is another way of making symmetric shapes!\nIn these two figures, a sheet of paper is \nfolded and a cut is made along the dotted \nline shown. Draw a sketch of how the paper will look when unfolded.\nDo you see a line of symmetry in this \nfigure? What is it?\nMake different symmetric shapes by folding and cutting.There are more ways of folding and cutting pieces of paper to get \nsymmetric shapes!\nUse thin rectangular coloured \npaper. Fold it several times and create some intricate patterns by cutting the paper, like the one shown here. Identify the lines of symmetry in the repeating design. Use such decorative paper cut-outs for festive occasions.\n  Figure it Out \n Punching Game\n  The fold is a \nline of symmetry.

Copy the following on a dot grid. For each figure draw two more \nlines to make a shape that has a line of symmetry.\n9.2 Rotational Symmetry\nThe paper windmill in the picture looks \nsymmetrical but there is no line of symmetry! However, if you fold it, the two halves will not exactly overlap. On the other hand, if you rotate it by 90° about the red point at the centre, the windmill looks exactly the same.\nWe say that the windmill has rotational \nsymmetry.\nWhen talking of rotational symmetry, there is always a fixed \npoint about which the object is rotated. This fixed point is called the centre of rotation.\nWill the windmill above look exactly the same when rotated \nthrough an angle of less than 90°?\nNo!An angle through which a figure can be rotated to look exactly the \nsame is called an angle of rotational symmetry, or just an angle of \nsymmetry, for short.180˚\n180˚\nChapter 9_Symmetry.indd   230 13-08-2024   17:05:28\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSymmetry231For the windmill, the angles of symmetry are 90° (quarter turn), \n180° (half turn), 270° (three-quarter turn) and 360° (full turn). \nObserve that when any figure is rotated by 360°, it comes back to its original position, so 360° is always an angle of symmetry.\nThus, we see that the windmill has 4 angles of symmetry.Do you know of any other shape that has exactly four angles of \nsymmetry?\nHow many angles of symmetry does a square have? How much \nrotation does it require to get the initial square?\nWe get back a square overlapping with itself after 90° of rotation. \nThis takes point A to the position of point B, point B to the position of point C, point C to the position of point D, and point D back to the position of point A. Do you know where to mark the centre of rotation?\nA B\nC DB C\nD AImaginary \nreference lineLine after rotation\nSquare after \nrotationInitial position\nWhat are the other angles of symmetry?\nLine after rotationInitial positionC D\nA B180o\nLine after rotationInitial positionA\nB CD\n270o\n360oA B\nD C\nChapter 9_Symmetry.indd   231 13-08-2024   17:05:28\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6232Example: Find the angles of symmetry of the following strip.\nSolution : Let us rotate the strip in a clockwise direction about its centre.\nA rotation of 180° results in the figure above. Does this overlap \nwith the original figure.\nNo. Why?\nAnother rotation through 180° from this position gives the original \nshape.\nThis figure comes back to its original shape only after one \ncomplete rotation through 360°. So, we say that this figure does not \nhave rotational symmetry.\nRotational Symmetry of Figures with \nRadial ArmsConsider this figure, a picture with 4 radial arms. How many angles of symmetry does it have? What are they? \nNote that the angle between adjacent central dotted lines is 90°.\nCan you change the angles between \nthe radial arms so that the figure still has 4 angles of symmetry? Try drawing it.\nTo check if the figure drawn indeed has 4 angles of symmetry, \nyou could draw the figure on two different pieces of paper. Cut out the radial arms from one of the papers. Keep the figure on the paper fixed and rotate the cutout to check for rotational symmetry.\nHow will you modify the figure above so that it has only two \nangles of symmetry?90O\nChapter 9_Symmetry.indd   232 13-08-2024   17:05:28\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSymmetry233Here is one way:\nWe have seen figures having 4 and 2 angles of symmetry. Can we \nget a figure having exactly 3 angles of symmetry? Can you use radial \narms for this?\nLet us try with 3 radial arms as in the figure below. How many \nangles of symmetry does it have and what are they?\nHere is a figure with three radial arms.\nTrace and cut out a copy of this figure. By rotating the cutout over \nthis figure determine its angles of rotation.\nWe see that only a full turn or a rotation of 360° will bring the figure \nback into itself. So this figure does not have rotational symmetry as 360 degrees is its only angle of symmetry.\nHowever, can anything in the figure be changed to make it have \n3 angles of symmetry?\nChapter 9_Symmetry.indd   233 13-08-2024   17:05:29\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6234Can it be done by changing the angles between the dotted lines?\nIf a figure with three radial arms should have rotational symmetry, \nthen a rotated version of it should overlap with the original. Here are rough diagrams of both of them.\nIf these two figures must overlap, what can you tell about the \nangles?\nC\nBA\n B\nAC\nObserve that ∠A must overlap ∠B, ∠B must overlap ∠C and ∠C \nmust overlap ∠A.\nSo, ∠A = ∠B = ∠C. What must this angle be?\nWe know that a full turn has 360 degrees. This is equally distributed \namongst these three angles. So each angle must be 360°\n3 = 120°.\nSo, the radial arms figure with 3 arms shows rotational symmetry \nwhen the angle between the adjacent dotted lines is 120°. Use paper cutouts to verify this observation.\nNow how many angles of rotation does the figure have and what \nare they?\nInitial \npositionAfter 120° \nrotationAfter 240° \n(120° + 120°) \nrotationAfter 360° \n(120° + 120°+ 120°) \nrotation\nNote : The colours have been added to show the rotations.\nChapter 9_Symmetry.indd   234 13-08-2024   17:05:29\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSymmetry235Let us explore more figures.\n Can you draw a figure with radial arms that has a) exactly 5 \nangles of symmetry\n, b) 6 angles of symmetry? Also find the angles of \nsymmetry in each case.\nHint :  Use 5 radial \narms for the first case. What should the angle \nbetween two adjacent radial arms be?\n Consider a figure with radial arms having exactly 7 angles \nof symmetry. What will be its smallest angle of symmetry? Is the number of degrees a whole number in this case? If not, express it as a mixed fraction.\nLet us find the angles of symmetry for other kinds of figures.\n Figure it Out \n1. Find the angles of symmetry for the given figures about the point \nmarked • .\n(a) (b) (c)\n2. Which of the following figures have more than one angle of \nsymmetry?\nChapter 9_Symmetry.indd   235 13-08-2024   17:05:29\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGanita Prakash | Grade 62363. Give the order of rotational symmetry for each figure:\nLet us list down the angles of symmetry for all the cases above.\n• Angles of symmetry when \nthere are exactly 2 of them: 180°, 360°.\n• Angles of symmetry when \nthere are exactly 3 of them: 120°, \n240°, 360°.\n• Angles of symmetry when \nthere are exactly 4 of them: 90°, \n180°, 270°, 360°.\nDo you observe something common about the angles of symmetries \nin these cases? The first set of numbers are all multiples of 180. The \nsecond are all multiples of 120. The third are all multiples of 90. \n In each case, the angles are the multiples of the smallest angle. \nYou ma\ny wonder and ask if this will always happen. What do you \nthink?\n True or False\n• Every figure will have 360 degrees as an angle of symmetry.\nChapter 9_Symmetry.indd   236 13-08-2024   17:05:30\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSymmetry237• If the smallest angle of symmetry of a figure is a natural number \nin degrees, then it is a factor of 3\n60.\nIs there a smallest angle of symmetry for all figures? It turns out \nthat this is the case for most figures, except for the most symmetric shapes like the circle, whose symmetries we now discuss.\nSymmetries of a circle\nThe circle is a fascinating figure. What happens when you rotate a circle clockwise about its centre? It coincides with itself. It does not matter what angle you rotate it by! So, for a circle, every angle is an angle of symmetry.\nNow take a point on the rim of the circle and join it to the centre. \nExtend the segment to a diameter of the circle. Is that diameter a line\n of reflection symmetry? It \nis. Every diameter is a line of \nsymmetry!\nLike wheels, we can find other objects around us having rotational \nsymmetry. Find them.

Such an angle is called an angle of symmetry  \nof the figure. A figure that has an angle of symmetry strictly between 0 and 360 degrees is said to have rotational symmetry. The point \nof the figure about which the rotation occurs is called the centre of \nrotation.\n \u001fA figure may have multiple angles of symmetry.\n \u001fSome figures may have a line of symmetry but no angle of symmetry, while others may have angles of symmetry but no lines of symmetry. Some figures may have both lines of symmetry as well as angles of symmetry. Not allowed\nChapter 9_Symmetry.indd   241 13-08-2024   17:05:38\nReprint 2025-26\n"}

You are a wonderful \nexample of a living being. Whenever you attempt to group things around you as living or non-living, you can compare them with yourself. Which characteristics help you in differentiating yourself from a car? For instance, a car does not grow. Does it mean it is non-living? Now, which characteristics have you used to classify a car as non-living? Continue your discussion in a similar way to identify the essential characteristics of living beings.\nWhat are some common characteristics that make living \nbeings very different from the non-living things? Let us learn about them.\nCan we consider movement as one of the characteristics to \ndifferentiate between the living and the non-living? List five things around you that can move on their own. Do you think that all five things that you have listed can be considered as living just because they can move on their own? However, unlike animals, plants do not move from one place to another. Do you consider them as living? \nEven though plants do not move from \none place to another, they do show certain types of movements. Opening of flowers is one of the examples of movement in plants. Another example of movement in plants is seen in insectivorous plants. Insectivorous plants are dependent on insects for their nutrition. Drosera is one of the examples of an insectivorous plant. Drosera is featured with saucer-shaped leaves having many hair-like projections of unequal length with sticky ends. Whenever an insect enters the saucer, hairs move inward and trap the insect with their sticky ends. Try to observe the mechanism of movement in other insectivorous plants. Climbers also wind themselves around any object placed close to them. That means, even though plants do not move from one place to another, they do show some movements.\nCompare yourself with the \npicture of your childhood.

No, \nbecause you have become larger in size. This is due to growth in your body. Plants and other living beings also grow. Can we consider growth as a characteristic of living beings? \nLiving beings need food (nutrition) for their growth \nand development. List five living beings that require food  \nto grow.\nNow, think of a process without which we cannot live. \nCount the number of breaths you take per minute after a normal walk, after a run, and after a few dance steps. Record the data and observe. Do you notice any difference in the number of breaths after each situation? Do you notice the process of breathing in other animals like dogs, cats, cows and buffaloes? Notice the movement of their abdomen while they are taking rest. \nIn the process of breathing, when we inhale, the air \nmoves from outside to inside our body. When we breathe out, the air moves from inside our body to outside. Breathing is part of a process called respiration. Do plants also respire? There are tiny pores called stomata on the surface of leaves. These pores help plants in taking air in and out. Interact with senior class students in your school and request if they can demonstrate stomata using a microscope in your class. All living beings respire.\nHave you noticed white patches forming on shirts around \nthe armpits during summers? These patches are formed due to sweat. The sweat consists of water and salts removed by the body as waste products. Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion. Urine is also formed as a product of excretion in animals. Do you know that plants also excrete? You may notice plants excrete excess water and minerals in the form of small droplets on leaves. For example, grasses and roses.  All living beings excrete.\nLet us look at another characteristic. \nWhat is your reaction if you unexpectedly \nstep on a sharp object, such as a thorn, \nWater droplets on grass\nChapter 10.indd   186 10/4/2024   3:10:11 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLiving Creatures: Exploring their \nCharacteristics\n187while walking without shoes, or you accidentally touch a hot \ncup of tea? Stepping on a thorn and touching a hot object are stimuli. Any thing or any event that prompts living beings to respond is called a stimulus. List three stimuli (plural of stimulus) and your body’s instant response to them. \nDo plants also respond to \nstimuli? Yes, plants also respond to stimuli. For example, touch-me-not (mimosa, chhui-mui, \nlajjalu) plants fold their leaves when we touch them. Have you also observed that certain plants fold their leaves after sunset? Specifically, the leaves of certain plants facing each other tend to come together. This can be observed in the sleeping leaves of amla (Indian gooseberry) \ntree. All living beings respond to stimuli. Find a few more plants in your neighbourhood which fold their leaves after sunset. \nWhy do the leaves of chhui-mui and amla plants respond \nin this way? Which stimulus could be responsible for their behaviour?\nHave you seen young ones of cats, dogs or other animals? \nList young ones of five different animals. Have you seen young ones of any non-living things such as a pencil, a chair or an electric bulb?\nAll living beings reproduce. Reproduction is the \nprocess of producing new ones of one’s own kind. Why is reproduction necessary? It is necessary for the continuity of life. \nWhen a living being is not able to exhibit all of the above \nmentioned characteristics, despite the availability of all resources (like food, air and water) needed for being alive, it is said to be dead. \nFrom the above discussion, we can understand that \nall living beings share some common characteristics. For \nexample, all living beings show movement, they need \nTouch-me-not (chhui-mui) plant\nChapter 10.indd   187 10/4/2024   3:10:24 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n188food, and they grow. They also respire, reproduce, excrete, \nrespond to stimuli, and eventually, die. Absence of any of these features indicates that they are non-living things. \nNow that you know how to identify a living being, fill \nup the remaining two columns (IV and V) of Table 10.1 and complete the activity.\nIn which category would you place a seed—living or non-\nliving?

Similarly, plants too need favourable conditions and nutrients for their proper growth and development. What other conditions do you think would affect seed germination?\nIn Activity 10.1, what are the \ncharacteristics of living beings which made you place plants in living beings? Do plants show growth in Activity 10.2? Are there any other characteristics of living beings that these plants show?\nLet us study another characteristic that can be seen \nclearly in plants—growth and movement.\n10.3 Growth and Movement in Plants \nHow do plants respond to sunlight? Does sunlight affect the direction of growth of different parts of plants? In which direction would the root and shoot of a plant grow and move if the plant is placed inverted?

Record your observations in Table 10.2.\n Compare your predictions with your observations.\nDo you think sunlight is necessary for germination of \nseeds? Do the seeds in all the pots receive air, water and sunlight? Is there any pot in which air is not available to the seeds? If so, why is it not available? What happens to the seeds in the pot where water is provided in excess? Which seeds receive both air and water? Identify the pots where you can notice the germination of seeds. \nDo your observations match with your predictions? \nWrite possible reasons in favour of your observations in Table 10.2. Based on your observations, state the conditions which favour seed germination.\nWhich of the following are essential for seed germination–\nair, water and sunlight? Compare the available conditions in each pot. Germination of bean seeds requires the right amount of water and air. Why do seeds require these conditions for germination? Do you think that the absence \nof one or more of these conditions will affect seed germination?\nLet us understand how these conditions help \nin seed germination. The effects of the following conditions have been seen in Activity 10.2.\nWater: Seeds require water for germination. \nWater enables the seeds to carry out the processes necessary for their growth. The outer covering of the seed is called seed coat. Water softens the seed coat and helps the tiny embryo inside it to develop into a plant.\nAir and Soil: Seeds need air for germination. They use the \nair available in the spaces between soil particles. Moreover, spaces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily.\nLight and/or dark conditions: We have learnt that for \nthe bean seeds, presence of light is not essential for their germination. In general, most seeds do not require light for germination. But after germination, sunlight is required for further growth of the seedling.\nGerminated bean seedSeed Coat\nEmbryo\nChapter 10.indd   190 10/4/2024   3:10:53 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nIn the Chapter ‘Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body’, \nyou have learnt that human beings need a balanced diet \nfor good health and proper growth.

When the plant is kept inverted, the root bends and grows \ndownwards. Also, the shoot bends and grows upwards.\n3. When the plant gets sunlight only from one direction, the shoot grows in the direction of light \nwhile the root \ncontinues to grow downwards.\nAfter conducting Activity 10.3, we can conclude that shoots \nof plants grow upward and exhibit movement towards sunlight but roots of plants grow downwards.\nJagadish Chandra Bose (1858–1937) was an Indian \nscientist who did some fascinating experiments \nwith plants. He built a machine called a crescograph to record how plants respond to stimuli like light, heat, electricity and gravity. With this machine, he could measure how fast plants grow. He also showed that plants can sense and respond to stimuli.\nKnow a scientist\n10.4  Life Cycle of a Plant\nWe have learnt about conditions required for germination \nand how plants grow and exhibit movement.

What changes do you observe after the fruits are formed? Does the plant become yellow and dry even when you continue watering it? Sow the seeds obtained from your bean plant. Watch how the seeds give rise to a new generation of bean plants. Compare the sketches that you have drawn in Table 10.4 with Fig.\n 10.4. \nA seed grows into a young plant and matures to produce \nflowers and fruit. The fruit, \nin this case a pod, contains \nseeds which give rise to a new generation of bean plants. The entire process from a seed to a plant, and then, to the next generation of seeds is called the life cycle of a plant (Fig. 10.4). When a plant stops growing and all activities of life gradually come to an end, even after the availability of all the necessary conditions, the plant is considered dead.10.4 Life Cycle of a Plant\nWe have learnt about conditions required for germination and how plants grow and exhibit movement.

Female mosquitoes are bloodsucking insects that transmit several diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya. You might have learnt from newspapers, school noticeboards or awareness campaigns that mosquito\n breeding should be \nprevented. We are advised not to allow water to stagnate anywhere in \nour surroundings. Why is it so? Does stagnant \nwater have any relation with mosquitoes laying eggs?Fig. 10.4: Life cycle of a bean plantStage I  \n(Seed)\nStage II (Seed germination)Stage III  \n(Appearance  \nof leaves)Stage IV \n(Appearance  \nof flowers)Death of \nplant\nStage V (Appearance \nof fruits) Fruit  \n(Pod with  \nseeds)\nChapter 10.indd   196 10/4/2024   3:11:38 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLiving Creatures: Exploring their \nCharacteristics\n197Conduct a safety audit in your school, or at your home \nand surroundings to check for stagnant water (if available, \ncarry a hand  lens to observe any small creatures). Some \ncommon  places where stagnant water is likely to gather \nare desert coolers, \nplanted pots and any open container. \nYou may find two different types of worm-like creatures (Fig. 10.5). They are larva and pupa, two distinct life stages \nduring the development of mosquito. In case you observe larvae and pupae, report to your teacher. Discuss with the teacher and classmates about the necessary measures one can take to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. What differences do you observe in the shape of larvae and pupae? \nFig. 10.5: Larvae and pupae of mosquitoes in a stagnant water body\nPupa\nLarva\nMosquito larvae and pupae observed in water bodies \nrepeatedly come to the water surface. What can be the reason for this? Mosquito larvae and pupae live in water and require air to respire. They move to the surface of the water for air.\nHow can the \nlife cycle of a mosquito be disrupted?\nI have seen my mother \nspraying kerosene oil \non stagnant water. Why \ndoes she do so?\nKerosene oil forms a thin layer over \nthe water surface. This layer separates \nwater from air, and does not allow \nlarvae and pupae to inhale air. As a \nresult, they die. ?\nChapter 10.indd   197 10/4/2024   3:11:56 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n198Activity 10.5: Let us analyse\nLet us solve an interesting puzzle.\nHow will you decide which stage (larva or pupa) comes \nimmediately after the egg stage? \nSuppose you are given a container with water from a \npuddle  containing larvae and pupae.

The adult \nmosquito may survive for 10 to 15 days. \nWe have seen that a mosquito begins its life as an egg \n(stage I), the egg develops into a larva (stage II), the larva grows into pupa (stage III), and the pupa transforms into an adult mosquito (stage IV). The adult female mosquito lays eggs directly on or near water, and the cycle continues.\nSignificant changes occur in the appearance, body shape \nand structure during the various stages in the life cycle of a mosquito. The shape of the egg is quite different from the larva; the larva appears very different from the pupa. The pupa appears very distinct from the adult mosquito. Is it easy to imagine that a mosquito emerges from a pupa?\nThe silk moth also passes through four life stages—egg, larva, \npupa and adult. Eggs hatch into larvae, which then grow in size. Larvae secrete thread-like material which they wrap around themselves, before changing to pupae. These are the fibres that are used to make silk fabric. In India, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has set up several centres for silk production.\n Do you \nknow?\n10.5.2 Life cycle of a frog\nActivity 10.6: Let us analyse\nAvadhi and Aayush are dressed up in full sleeves shirts and \nfull pants today.

You may also go to a small \nwater body during the rainy season with a facilitator and explore it by taking due safety precautions. \nYou may notice a white jelly-like substance on the surface \nof water towards the edge of the pond (Fig. 10.7). This may also be attached to plants growing in or around the water. This jelly-like substance is actually a cluster of eggs of a frog and is known as spawn.\nObserve the features of all the stages of a frog shown in \nFig.\n 10.7. How will you decide \nthe sequence of the given stages \n(A, B, C, D, E, F)? Some of the stages show distinct changes in their initial and final shapes.

You will find four stages in the life cycle of a frog—  the egg stage, which progresses to the embryo stage; the tadpole stage, consisting of an early stage with a tail and no legs, and a late stage with hind legs; the froglet stage, and \nthe adult frog stage (Fig.\n 10.8). \nStage IV – Adult frog \n(14 weeks)\nStage III – Froglet \n(12 weeks)\nStage IIB – Tadpole with legs\n(8-10 weeks)Stage IIA– Tadpole with tail \n(Day 7-10)Stage IB– Embryo\n(Day 3-4)Stage IA– Spawn\n(Day 1)\nFig. 10.8: Life cycle of a frog\nDiscuss in the class along the following points:\n How are these eggs of a frog different from the other eggs that you may have seen?\n Which stage has the shortest duration? \n Is there a change in the habitat during the various stages in the life cycle of a frog?\n How do the special features support that stage?\nObserve Fig. 10.8. You will see that tadpoles develop legs \nbut still have tails. Tails help them swim in water. Tadpoles grow gradually and start looking like little frogs called froglets. They still live in water but begin to spend some time on land. They continue to grow and lose their tails completely. Their legs become strong to help them jump and land. They become fully developed adult frogs who live both in water and on land.\nChapter 10.indd   201 10/4/2024   3:12:02 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n202Plants and animals are a part of the living world. They \ngo through various changes during the course of their lives. \nWe have learnt that a tiny plant grows and develops into a big tree. We have also learnt how animals grow and change from young ones to adults. This journey varies for each animal, making it unique and special. We have seen pupae change into insects, and tadpoles change into frogs. Such changes are important for plants and animals to survive and to maintain continuity of their kind.

Absence of any of these features indicates that they are not living beings.\n  Each living being goes through several stages during its life. \n  Germination of seeds depends upon the availability of \nwater, air and suitable light and/or dark conditions.\n  During germination of seeds, roots generally grow \ndownwards, while shoots grow upwards.\n  A plant’s life cycle starts with seed germination, followed by several stages of its growth and development. These include flowering and seed production. Seeds produced during their life cycle would germinate into new plants and the cycle continues.\n  The life cycle of an animal as a result of reproduction, begin with a newborn that undergoes various stages of growth and development followed by an adult stage and finally death. The process of reproduction maintains the continuity of its kind. \n  Mosquitoes pass through the stages of egg, larva, pupa and \nadult. The life stages of a frog include eggs, tadpoles, \nfroglets and adults.\n  In some living beings, such as mosquitoes and frogs, significant changes occur during the various stages of their life cycles. These changes can be seen in body shape, structure and sometimes even in the habitat.\nLet us enhance our learning \n1.

This \nvacation, they visit their Ajji (grandmother). Ajji lives in a \nvillage on the edge of a forest in the Western Ghats. The air in the village is fresh and cooler than in the city. They can see beautiful hills, streams, and many interesting plants, animals and birds around them. \nOne afternoon, Bhoomi and Surya ask Ajji to tell them \nmore about the place. Ajji says, “Children, do you know that \nthis place has several treasures of nature that enrich our lives?  The pure air is refreshing and the soil is so fertile that it supports a variety of living beings. Moreover, this place gets plenty of sunlight which is useful in many ways. Different varieties of trees provide food and shelter to animals including various birds and insects. Can you think of more such treasures of nature?” \nA village\nChapter 11.indd   207 10/4/2024   3:03:50 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n208Bhoomi replies, “Ajji, we use water for drinking and \ngrowing vegetables.” Ajji says, “Yes.

The air which we breathe in has oxygen. Our body needs oxygen to perform its functions. When we hold our breath for a long time, the body does not get enough oxygen to perform its functions. Thus, we need oxygen for our survival. Similarly, most of the living beings also need oxygen for  \ntheir survival.

Do you \nknow?\nFig. 11.1: Composition of air\nYou notice the presence of air when the leaves of a tree \nrustle, the clothes hanging on a clothes line sway, or the pages \nof an open book begin to flutter once a fan is switched on.\nMoving air is called wind. Sometimes it blows fast, for \nexample, during a storm, and sometimes it blows gently as a breeze. You must have played with a firki (paper pinwheel) many times. Let us make a firki by performing Activity 11.2.The air which surrounds the Earth is a mixture of gases. \nCan you name some gases which are present in the air? Air contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and other gases in small quantities. Fig. 11.1 gives the composition of air in percentage. Notice that in Fig. 11.1 there are 100 squares. Out of 100 squares, 78 are occupied by nitrogen, 21 are occupied by oxygen, and 1 by argon, carbon dioxide and other gases. \nPercentage is the number of parts in 100. It is \ndenoted by the symbol ‘%’.More to \nknow!\nComposition of air\nNitrogen (78%)\nOxygen (21%) \nArgon, carbon dioxide \nand other gases (1%) \nChapter 11.indd   209 10/4/2024   3:04:19 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n210We have learnt that air is very important for us. Water too \nis essential and precious for us. How do you feel when you \ncannot get water to drink, especially when you are thirsty? Let us find out more about water.\n11.2 Water \nBhoomi and Surya help Ajji in \nfilling the troughs of water for the cows. They also help her in watering plants such as vegetables and medicinal herbs in the garden. Ajji teaches them how to water the \nplants so that every drop is used and none of it goes waste. \nCan you think of some more \nuses of water in your daily life?

What do you observe? \nDoes the firki rotate? When you move it a little back \nand forth, the firki rotates. What makes a firki \nrotate? It is the wind that makes a firki rotate. \nThe working of a windmill is similar to that \nof a firki. Wind rotates the wings of a windmill. \nWindmills can be used to run flour mills, to pull \nup water from a well, or to generate electricity. \nIn India, there are many windmill farms. \nA windmill farm is an area that has a large number of windmills which use the energy of \nthe wind to generate electricity (Fig. 11.3).\nFig 11.3: A windmill farm \nMuppandal Wind Farm in Tamil Nadu, Jaisalmer \nWind Park in Rajasthan and Brahmanvel Wind Farm in Maharashtra are some of the leading windmill farms in our country.

It is also used for growing crops and for industrial purposes. Where do we get water from? Make a list of the different sources of water.\nWater covers about two-thirds of the Earth’s surface. \nMost of the water is found in oceans and seas. However, \nthis water is saline or salty. This saline water is not fit for domestic, agricultural and industrial use. For all these activities, we need freshwater, which is present in the form of ice sheets or snow, rivers or lakes on the surface of the Earth, and underground. Freshwater present in ice sheets \n..................................\n..................................\nWe need \nwater for \ndrinking.Watering the plants\nChapter 11.indd   211 10/4/2024   3:04:35 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n212and snow, or underground water is difficult to access. A very \nsmall fraction of the freshwater present in ponds, rivers, lakes and wells is easily accessible.

What can you and your family \ndo to reduce this wastage of water? There are many ways to reduce wastage of water. For example, turning off taps when not in use and fixing water leakages. Recycling water \nand water harvesting also help in saving water.\nOur country is blessed with numerous rivers, streams \nand lakes. Have you ever noticed plastic bags and wrappers \nfloating on the surface of water?

Waste \nfrom homes and industries pollute our water sources when it is dumped into them. Identify other human activities that lead to water pollution. Discuss with your friends in the class what you can do to reduce water pollution. Polluted water is not fit for consumption by living beings.\nAs freshwater sources are limited, there is a shortage of \nwater in many parts of India. At some places, people have to walk long distances to fetch drinking water. Everyone does not have the same kind of access to water. It is important for us to conserve water and use it judiciously. We must also prevent it from being polluted so that water remains fit for consumption by all living beings. In what ways can you conserve water? \nWater harvesting is one of the \nmethods for conserving water. In many buildings, rainwater is collected and stored in large quantities for later use. This is called rainwater harvesting  (Fig. 11.4a). \nDo you know \nthat rainwater is also harvested in many homes, residential societies or schools? It is an age-old practice in India. \nFor example, stepwells  (Fig. 11.4b), \ncommonly known as Bawadi in Rajasthan and Vav in Gujarat are \nbuilt for water harvesting as a response to the scarcity of water in these regions. These stepwells have a unique system of water harvesting. They store not only rainwater but also water seeping from nearby lakes, ponds and rivers. The walls of the trenches (long deep holes dug in the ground) are lined with blocks of \nstones that allow seepage of water. Find traditional water harvesting practices in your locality. Discuss with your teachers and parents to \nlearn more about it. \nFig. 11.4 (b): Bawadi (Toorji ka Jhalra, \nJodhpur in Rajasthan) Fig. 11.4 (a): Rainwater harvesting\nChapter 11.indd   213 10/4/2024   3:04:36 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n214In the chapter ‘A Journey through States of Water’, we \nhave learnt about the water cycle, where the Sun plays an \nimportant role in the evaporation of water. Have you ever observed your mother or grandmother cut raw mangoes and expose them to the hot sun for several days to dry? Let us explore more about energy from the Sun.\n11.3  Energy from the Sun\nOn a sunny day, Bhoomi and Surya are helping Ajji dry \nchillies in the Sun. Ajji says, “We use the heat from the Sun \nto dry it. We can use dried chillies when fresh ones are not available. I will give you some to take home. Do you know that the Sun is the main source of energy on Earth? All plants and animals are dependent on it.”\nWe use heat and light from the Sun for various purposes. \nWhat are some of the activities for which we need heat and light? Bhoomi draws some pictures to show the uses of heat and light from the Sun. Help her by adding more examples. Draw the pictures and write their descriptions in the  \nspace provided.\nPlants make food Drying of clothes \nOne afternoon, Bhoomi and Surya pass by the field near \nAjji’s house, where they see a cow grazing the grass. They talk about the Sun being the main source of energy. Read the conversation carefully and answer.\n \nWorld Water Day is observed on 22nd March every year. \nFind out its importance. Do you \nknow?\nChapter 11.indd   214 10/4/2024   3:04:50 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNature’s Treasures\n215Sunlight helps plants prepare food. The Sun also provides \nall the living beings on Earth with heat and light. It is their \nmain source of energy. \nHave you seen solar panels on \nrooftops, on top of street lights or on traffic signals? The solar panels capture the Sun’s energy and produce electricity. Energy from the Sun can also be directly used for cooking in a solar cooker or for heating water in a solar water heater.\nThe \ncow is standing \nin the Sun. But it \ndoes not mean that it \nis getting energy from \nthe Sun.  The \ncow is eating \ngrass. Grass leaves \nneed sunlight to grow. So, \nthe main source of energy \nis the Sun.  This way the \ncow gets energy from \nthe Sun.\nIn many households in India, water is offered to the Sun early \nin the morning as an expression of gratitude to the Sun.Do you \nknow?\nAccording to you, whose statement is correct and why?\n?\nUses of solar energySolar panelsSolar water heaterNo, I think \nthis cow \nis getting \nenergy from \nthe Sun.  \nLook at this \ncow. It is \ngrazing the \ngrass and \ngetting energy \nfrom it. \nChapter 11.indd   215 10/4/2024   3:05:04 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n216One cannot imagine life on \nEarth without the Sun. The Sun is \nthe main source of energy on the Earth. Plants get energy from the Sun and produce food. Animals eat plants and grow. We get food from both plants and animals. This cycle on Earth is possible due to the Sun. \nSo, we all are dependent on the Sun as the main source of energy. Where do we find a large variety of  \nplants or animals? Let us explore. \n11.4 Forests \nOne morning, Ajji takes Bhoomi and Surya for a walk in \nthe forest. They find a variety of herbs, shrubs and trees in the forest. Ajji explains, “Forests are large areas with dense \ngrowth of various types of plants.” On the way, they collect some nellikai (Kannada term for Indian gooseberries) \nthat have fallen on the ground. Ajji tells them, “We have a \ntradition in the village not to pluck fruits from the trees; they are left for animals and birds to eat.”\nWhat will happen if the Sun \nis not visible for a few days?\n1.  We may have to depend \non artificial lighting during day time also.\n2.  \n3.   ?\nA forest\nChapter 11.indd   216 10/4/2024   3:05:04 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNature’s Treasures\n217Discuss with your friends and make a list of at least five \nproducts that we get from forests. \nForests are a natural home for many wild animals, \nincluding birds and insects. Forests provide food and shelter \nto them. In nature, every animal depends on other life forms for survival. The diversity of life forms ensures food for every living being. However, over the years, the forest cover has been decreasing, mainly due to human activities like large scale cutting of trees. It takes many years to grow a new forest or restore lost forests. Therefore, we must preserve and use forests responsibly so that they get enough time  \nto regenerate.\nVan Mahotsav is a week-\nlong event celebrated across the country during the month of July. It is a forest festival during which new plants and trees are planted, and awareness about respecting forests is raised. The aim of the event is to increase the green cover. You too can plan a Van Mahotsav in your community.\nFrom ancient times, India had a tradition \nof respecting, protecting and preserving forests. You have already learnt about sacred groves in the chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’. Many efforts have been made by common people to prevent the cutting of trees, and \nthus, saving forests. One such \neffort is the famous Chipko \nmovement. It started in the \nearly 1970s in Uttarakhand (previously part of Uttar Pradesh). Local women actively participated in this movement. They encircled and hugged the trees to protect them from being felled. \nDo you \nknow?\nWhat are the consequences of \ncutting a large forest area? Make a presentation or do a role play, or write a story or a poem that \n?shows what could happen if we continue to cut down trees in our forests.\nChapter 11.indd   217 10/4/2024   3:05:25 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n218During their walk in the forests, Bhoomi and Surya notice \nthat there are a lot of leaves on the ground and the soil feels \ndamp. Ajji explains, “The roots of plants hold on to the soil \nand prevent it from being washed away. The leaves that fall from the trees decay and enrich the soil with nutrients. This soil is used by new plants and trees to grow. This is an example of recycling in nature.” Let us investigate the soil in  \nmore detail.\n11.5  Soil, Rocks and Minerals \nBhoomi, Surya and Ajji come back \nhome from the forest. Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji in preparing \nthe soil in the garden for planting some vegetables (Fig. 11.5). Ajji asks them to dig the soil gently and loosen the lumps. You have already learnt in the chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’ that for plants to grow,  the space between the soil particles not only provides \nsufficient air but also space for the \nroots to grow easily. Bhoomi and Surya could see small pebbles, the roots of plants and a few earthworms too in the soil. Do you realise that earthworms are natural agents that help in turning and loosening the soil?\nWhile Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji, let us do our own \nexperiment by performing Activity 11.4.\nActivity 11.4:  Let us investigateFig. 11.5: Soil preparation for  \nplanting vegetables\nCaution   \nRemember to wash your hands \nthoroughly after touching the \nsoil collected from different \nplaces.

Do you realise that earthworms are natural agents that help in turning and loosening the soil?\nWhile Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji, let us do our own \nexperiment by performing Activity 11.4.\nActivity 11.4:  Let us investigate Observe the soil samples with your naked eye. If you \nhave a magnifying lens, look at the soil through it.\n Record your observations in Table 11.2.\n Is there any difference between your guess and what you can actually observe when you look closely?\n Do you see any differences in the soil samples taken from different places?\n Do you see differences in what you are able to observe with your naked eye and what you can observe with a magnifying lens?\nThere are many things in the soil, such as sand, insects \nand worms. There may be many small organisms that we \ncannot see with our naked eyes.  Plants and animals also become part of the soil as they decompose and decay. The soil samples collected from different places may be of different colours because they may contain different materials. \nHave you ever wondered how \nsoil is formed? Soil is formed by the disintegration (breaking apart) of rocks by actions of the Sun, water and living organisms over a long time (thousands of years). There are different types of soils.

Soil is a precious treasure that supports biodiversity. \nYou may have seen rocks in your surroundings. Rocks \nare used in the construction of houses, buildings, temples, roads, dams and table tops. Some rocks, like slate, are used for roofing (Fig. 11.6) and laterite can be used as a building material, like bricks (Fig. 11.7). Some of the important rocks are granite, sandstone and marble. Human beings have been using rocks to make tools such as hand axes (Fig. 11.8a) and arrowheads (Fig. 11.8b) since thousands of years. \nFig. 11.6: Rocks used for roofing\n Fig. 11.7: Laterite rocks used as bricks \nFig. 11.8 (a): Hand axes\nMining of marbleRocks play a vital role in our lives. It takes thousands to \nmillions of years to form rocks. Therefore, it is important to \nconserve and use them responsibly. Do you know how rocks and minerals are transported from one location to another? Most vehicles that we use for transportation use fossil fuels. Let us explore more about fossil fuels.\n11.6 Fossil Fuels\nWhat are rocks made up of? \nThey are made up of minerals. Important metals, such as aluminium, gold, copper and iron are extracted from minerals. Minerals are used in the manufacturing of airplanes, cars, jewellery, cosmetics, and Fig. 11.8 (b): Arrowheads made from stone\nChapter 11.indd   220 10/4/2024   3:05:28 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNature’s Treasures\n221electrical and electronic equipment.

What types of fuels \ndo they use? \n Record the information that you collect in Table 11.3.\n11.7 Natural Resources: Renewable and  Non-renewable \nNature’s treasures fulfill our needs. They are essential \nresources to sustain all life forms on the Earth. For example, we get heat and light from the Sun, water from rivers, and food from plants and animals. These resources which we get from nature are called natural resources. We also \nuse natural resources to make many useful things for our convenience. For example, electric bulbs, furniture, solar panels, bicycles, etc., make our lives comfortable. All such resources created by human beings are called  \nhuman-made resources. \nYou have learnt about various natural resources, such \nas air, water, energy from the Sun, forests, soil, rocks, minerals and fossil fuels. Some of these natural resources \nEarlier, coal, wood and dung cakes were used \nas fuels for cooking. Nowadays, less polluting natural gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) have gradually replaced these domestic fuels. \nDo you \nknow?Type of vehicle Type of fuel usedTable 11.3: Types of vehicles and fuels used\nWhat are the most common types of fuels used? Petrol \nand diesel are the two most widely used fuels for vehicles. \nPetrol, diesel and kerosene are obtained from petroleum. Petroleum along with natural gas and coal are commonly called fossil fuels. They are formed essentially from the \nremains of microorganisms  and plants that got buried deep \ninside the earth, and were converted to petroleum, natural gas and coal. It takes millions of years for these fuels to form.\nNatural gas is used for cooking and generating electricity. \nNowadays, it is also used in the form of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as a fuel for vehicles. It is a cleaner fuel than petrol or diesel. Coal is mainly used for the production of electricity. It is found in several parts of India. Find out the major coal-producing states and mark them in a map of India.\nChapter 11.indd   222 10/4/2024   3:05:43 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNature’s Treasures\n223Let us explore more about it by performing Activity 11.5.\nActivity 11.5: Let us conduct a survey\n Conduct a survey of vehicles in your neighbourhood.\n Which types of vehicles are there? What types of fuels \ndo they use? \n Record the information that you collect in Table 11.3.\nFossil fuels are found in limited quantities. Hence, we \nwill soon run out of fossil fuels if we continue to use them in \nthe manner that we currently do. To avoid such a situation, we need to explore alternate sources of energy. When fossil fuels are burnt, smoke and carbon dioxide gas are produced which pollutes the air. Over-dependence on fossil fuels for transportation and as domestic fuels has resulted in large scale air pollution.  \n11.7  Natural Resources: Renewable and  \nNon-renewable \nNature’s treasures fulfill our needs. They are essential resources to sustain all life forms on the Earth. For example, we get heat and light from the Sun, water from rivers, and food from plants and animals. These resources which we get from nature are called natural resources. We also \nuse natural resources to make many useful things for our convenience. For example, electric bulbs, furniture, solar panels, bicycles, etc., make our lives comfortable. All such resources created by human beings are called  \nhuman-made resources. \nYou have learnt about various natural resources, such \nas air, water, energy from the Sun, forests, soil, rocks, minerals and fossil fuels. Some of these natural resources Coal\n Petrol\n Natural gas\nLet us do our bit to conserve the fossil fuels by—\n  Walking or cycling to nearby places.\n  Using public transport.\nSuggest some more ways.\nChapter 11.indd   223 10/4/2024   3:05:43 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n224get replenished through natural processes over a period \nof time. If you remember, Ajji told Bhoomi and Surya that \nthey could collect only those nellikai that had fallen on the ground. This makes sure that there would be enough fruits for other animals and birds. The seeds from the droppings of animals and birds would enable new trees to grow, though it would take some years before we get fruits from these new trees. Thus, resources which get renewed, replenished or restored within a reasonable period of time are called renewable resources.  Air, water and forest are some of the \nexamples of renewable natural resources. Nature renews them. We should use our natural resources judiciously. \nOn the other hand, fossil fuels take millions of years to \nform. They are found in limited quantities and once used, they get exhausted. They are not produced or replenished within a reasonable period of time. These resources are called non-renewable resources. Examples of non-renewable natural resources are minerals, soil, rocks, coal, petroleum and natural gas.\n11.8 Resources We use\nIt is time for Bhoomi and Surya to go back home after a wonderful holiday at their Ajji’s home. Their Amma (mother) comes to pick them up. Bhoomi and Surya show her the vegetable plants that have started to grow in the garden and the dried chillies given by Ajji to take home.\nThey notice changes in the colour of the skyline and the \nsmell of the air once they reach the city. There are very few trees. The air does not smell as good as the air at Ajji’s place. They can smell smoke from the vehicles. The air is polluted. Amma says, “Yes. When we use fossil fuels in our vehicles, \nsmoke is generated. Now, there are vehicles which cause less pollution. For example, there are electric vehicles that do not release any smoke. So, people are making an effort to create alternatives.” \nCan you list some alternatives for reducing air pollution?\nChapter 11.indd   224 10/4/2024   3:05:43 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNature’s Treasures\n225We use many natural resources in our everyday life. \nLet us identify some resources that we use by performing \nActivity 11.6. \nActivity 11.6: Let us make a list of natural  \nresources used\nMake a list of activities you do in your daily life and write \ndown the natural resources used directly or indirectly for each activity.

These resources are air, water, soil, and \nfood from plants and animals. We get these resources from nature and also make things using them for our consumption. Therefore, we must conserve our natural resources and use them responsibly without wasting them. This way, we can continue to fulfill our present needs while also saving for the future, without harming the environment. \n“Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need but not \nfor every man’s greed.”\n– M.

If you stay in a big city, you may find that the sky is rarely clear and only a few stars are seen in the night sky. This is due to light pollution, smoke and dust. The presence of excessive artificial light at night time is referred to as light pollution. In villages or areas where there is less light pollution, a larger number of stars can be seen. Also, your house may be surrounded by tall buildings and trees, which may block your view. The night sky is best viewed from open dark areas. \nLight pollution is growing sharply globally. This is reducing our \nability to enjoy and study objects in the night sky. Some \ndark sky reserves and parks have been established \naround the world. Light pollution in the reserves is \ncontrolled to preserve dark skies for research. There are a few organisations which are working to educate people about reducing light pollution.\nDo you \nknow?\nNot all stars and constellations are visible from \nall places on Earth and on all nights in a year. \nFor example, the Pole Star is not visible from \nthe southern hemisphere of Earth. To identify a star or a constellation, you need to know how a particular constellation looks like \nand where to look for it in the night sky. To \nget familiar with the pattern of a constellation \nyou may use images such as Fig. 12.3 and Fig. 12.4. \nTo find out when and in which portion of the sky a star or \na constellation will be visible from your location, you may take the help of sky mapping apps that can be downloaded on a mobile phone, or other online resources.\nSky Map is a very handy app for identification \nof stars, constellations and planets from mobile phones. Stellarium is another such app. The computer version of Stellarium is free for download and has many features.\nMore to \nknow!Can we try to find \nany constellation \nor star of our \nchoice on any \nnight from our \nlocation?\nChapter 12.indd   236 10/4/2024   3:07:57 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBeyond Earth237Preparation for night sky watching\n Under the guidance of adults, identify a dark open area \nfor night sky watching. This should be away from lights, tall buildings and trees. \n Choose the date and time based upon what you plan to identify in the night sky. \n Choose a moonless night with no clouds, particularly for the Pole Star which is not very bright.\n It may be useful to have access to a mobile app with a sky map, or print out images of the constellations you plan to view. You may also carry a magnetic compass to find directions and a notebook to note or draw your observations.\n On the particular day and time selected, go to the identified place with an adult, where the night sky watching is to be done.\n After reaching there, wait for about half an hour for your eyes to get adjusted to the darkness. This will help you to see the night sky better (Fig. 12.5).\nFig. 12.5: Night sky watching\nCaution   \nDo not go to a \ndark open place \nat night time \nwithout adults \naccompanying you.\nYou may easily identify the Big Dipper and the Pole Star in the night sky.\nChapter 12.indd   237 10/4/2024   3:07:57 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n238Activity 12.2: Let us try to locate\n Look for the Big Dipper during summer time in the \nearly part of the night, say, around 9 p.m. View the sky above the horizon towards the northern part of the sky and identify the Big Dipper. \n Once you identify the Big Dipper, try to locate the Pole Star. Look at the two stars present at the end of the Big Dipper’s cup and imagine a straight line passing through these towards the north. At about five times the distance between these two stars, the imaginary line will lead to another star which is not very bright. This star is the Pole Star. \nYou may also locate the bright constellation Orion and the star Sirius in the night sky. \nActivity 12.3: Let us try to identify \n In India, Orion is best viewed during the months of December\n to April after sunset. \nSo, look for it during \nthat period. \n Three bright stars in a short straight line are located around the middle of Orion (imagined to be the belt of a hunter).

In India, the Sun is worshipped as Sūrya. The \nheat provided by the Sun keeps the Earth at a temperature that makes life possible. Sunlight is essential for plants to grow, which provide food and oxygen to animals, including humans. The Sun is responsible for climate, seasons, weather, water cycle, winds—all of which are important for sustaining life on the Earth. \nThe distance of the Sun from the Earth is about 150 million km. A useful unit for expressing distances within the solar system \nis ‘astronomical unit’ (au) which is approximately the \ndistance between the Sun and the Earth.The Sun produces heat and \nlight, and is the main source of energy on the Earth (Fig.\n 12.6).\nHow big is \nthe Sun? It is \nabout 100 times bigger than the Earth in diameter. And still, it looks so small because it is very far from the Earth.\nHowever, the Sun is much closer to us than the other stars \nhence it appears much bigger than the stars. As the stars (other than the Sun) are much farther away, they appear like points, even though some of those stars are much bigger Our \nSun is also a \nstar. So how is it that \nthe Sun appears big and \nlights up the sky while the \nother stars look like bright \ndots in the night sky and \nare not even visible \nduring the day time?More to \nknow!\nChapter 12.indd   239 10/4/2024   3:08:24 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n240than our Sun. During daytime, due to the extreme brightness \nof the Sun, it is not possible to view the other stars.\nWhile revolving around the Sun, the Earth is also \nrotating about its axis. For one full rotation, the \nEarth takes about 24 hours which is called a day. \nLike the Earth, other planets also rotate about \ntheir axes while revolving around the Sun.  You will learn more about this in the next Grade.More to \nknow!Planets\nA planet is a large, nearly spherical object that revolves \naround the Sun. Our Earth is a planet as it revolves around the Sun as shown in Fig. 12.7. The Earth takes nearly one year to complete one revolution. Like the Earth, there are other planets that revolve around the Sun.\nThe star nearest to us after the Sun is Proxima \nCentauri which lies at a distance of about 269000 au. This means that its distance is about 269000 times our distance to the Sun.\nMore to \nknow!\nThere are many more objects \nin the sky.  Our Earth, along \nwith some of these objects, \nand the Sun together form \nour Solar System (Fig. 12.7). \nMost of these objects move \naround the Sun. The \nmovement of an object around \nthe Sun is called revolution.Are stars the only \nobjects in the sky? \nOr, are there more \nobjects which \nwe may not have \nnoticed? \nChapter 12.indd   240 10/4/2024   3:08:50 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBeyond Earth241Fig. 12.7: An artist’s representation of the Solar System \n(To fit this figure within the page, the sizes and distances of various objects are not as per their \nactual sizes and distances in relation to each other , that is, the sizes and distances are not to \nscale in the figure)\nEarth\nVenusMercury Asteroid \nBelt\nSun MarsJupiter\nSaturnUranus\nNeptune\nFrom ancient times, various names have been used \nacross India for the planets visible to the naked eye. For example, Budha (Mercury), Śhukra (Venus), Pṛithvī (Earth), Mangala (Mars), Bṛihaspati or Guru  \n(Jupiter) and Śhani (Saturn). \nMore to \nknow!The eight planets, in order of their increasing distance \nfrom the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, \nSaturn, Uranus, and Neptune (Fig. 12.7). \nThe inner four planets nearest to the Sun—Mercury, \nVenus, Earth and Mars—are smaller in size. They have solid surfaces with rocks on them. \nChapter 12.indd   241 10/4/2024   3:09:04 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n242Venus is usually seen shining brightly at dawn and dusk, \nand is commonly called the Morning Star or the Evening \nStar, even though it is not a star. Mars is called the Red Planet because it appears red. This is because the soil on Mars is reddish in colour.\nA large portion of the Earth’s surface is covered with \nwater and thus, it appears blue from the space. Due to this, the Earth is also called the Blue Planet. \nThe four outermost planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and \nNeptune—are much larger compared to the Earth, and are mostly made of gases. These giant gaseous planets have large flat ring-like structures around them which are made of dust particles and rocky material. \nPlanets get most of their energy from the Sun. So, \nthe farther they are, the colder they are in general. The presence of an atmosphere on a planet can trap heat which can significantly change the temperature of a planet. That is why Venus, for example, is hotter than Mercury, although it is farther from the Sun. \nThere is another object called Pluto that lies farther than Neptune, \nand revolves around the Sun. It is smaller than the Earth’s Moon. When it was discovered, it was called a planet of the Solar System. But later, when similar more small objects were discovered, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 redefined the requirements of an object to be called a planet. As per this definition, these smaller objects, including Pluto, are now called dwarf planets. \nMore to \nknow!\nCan we identify \na planet also, \nthe way we \nidentified the \nconstellations?Among the planets, it is \neasiest to identify Venus \nwhich is very bright. After the Sun and the Moon, Venus is the brightest object in the sky. Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn can also be seen with the naked eye. They are \nChapter 12.indd   242 10/4/2024   3:09:18 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBeyond Earth243so far away that they look like shining dots, just like stars. \nSo how can we distinguish between planets and the stars? Unlike planets, the stars appear to twinkle a lot. \nActivity 12.4: Let us try to identify \n For most of the year, Venus can be located either at dawn or at dusk. \n When you are viewing at dawn, look for it near the Eastern direction before sunrise. \n When you are viewing at dusk, look for it near the Western direction after sunset.\nWhile many of the objects in the sky can be seen \nwith our naked eyes directly, we can see them brighter and larger using a pair of binoculars or an instrument called a telescope (Fig. 12.8). A telescope also helps us view many dim objects not visible by our naked eyes directly.\nYou may get an opportunity to view the sky through \na telescope whenever a night sky watching event is organised in your region.\nMany Higher Education \nInstitutions conduct night sky watching activities for school students. There are many Amateur Astronomy \nClubs all over the \ncountry which \norganise sky watching events periodically. Museums and Planetariums also organise similar events.\nDo you \nknow?How can we \nsee the planets \nwhich are not \nvisible to the \nnaked eye?\nWe know that \nplanets move \naround the Sun. \nAre there any \nobjects that move \naround planets?\nFig. 12.8: A telescope\nChapter 12.indd   243 10/4/2024   3:09:33 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n244Natural Satellites\nObjects that move around planets are commonly called \nsatellites. They are smaller in size than planets. Moons are natural satellites of planets. The Earth has one Moon, while Mars has two moons. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune have a large number of moons. \n(a)\n (b)\nFig. 12.9: The Moon  \n(a) Image taken by Cartosat, ISRO.  \n(b) Close-up image by cameras onboard Chandrayaan-3, ISRO.The Moon\nEarth’s natural satellite, the Moon, takes about 27 days to complete one revolution around the Earth. It is our nearest neighbour in the space. Unlike on the Earth, there is hardly any atmosphere on the Moon. How big is the Moon as compared to the Earth? The Moon is about a quarter the size of the Earth in diameter. The Moon’s surface shows circular bowl-like structures called craters  \n(Fig. 12.9). Most of these craters have been formed due to the impact of asteroids or rocks from the space hitting the Moon’s surface. Since there is no \nIn general, any object \nthat moves around a much larger object can also be called a satellite. For example, Earth can be considered a satellite of the Sun.\nThe Moon is about 3,84,000 km away from the Earth.More to \nknow!\nChapter 12.indd   244 10/4/2024   3:10:08 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBeyond Earth\n245\nTo improve our understanding of the Moon, India’s ﬁ  rst mission to \nthe Moon, Chandrayaan-1, was launched in 2008 and the second mission, Chandrayaan-2, in 2019. The third mission, Chandrayaan-3, was launched in July 2023 and its Vikram lander carrying the Pragyan rover successfully soft-landed on the Moon on 23 August 2023. With \nthis mission, India became the ﬁ  rst country in the world to \nachieve a landing near the little explored Moon’s south pole. \nTo mark this success, the Government of India declared 23 August to be celebrated as ‘National Space Day’ in India. A fourth mission, Chandrayaan-4, is being planned which aims to bring back soil and rock samples from the Moon.\nDo you \nknow?\nAsteroids\nThe Sun and the planets are nearly spherical in shape. There \nare many small objects in the Solar System which are rocky and irregular in shape. These are called asteroids. Many of these asteroids revolve around the Sun in paths that lie between those of Mars and Jupiter. This region is called the asteroid belt (Fig. 12.7). Occasionally, asteroids pass very close to the Earth. \nComets\nSometimes we have visitors from the outer regions of the Solar System! These objects with long tails are called comets (Fig. 12.10). They are made up of dust, gases, rocks and ice. As a comet approaches close to the Sun, the frozen material in it starts evaporating.

India has also launched three Chandrayaan missions to study the Moon, and a further mission is being planned. \nChapter 12.indd   245 10/18/2024   9:59:37 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n246material forms the tail of the comet. Comets appear dim as \nthey move away from the Sun and then, it is not possible to see them with the naked eye. \nMany comets have been \nfound that revolve around the Sun. These comets approach close to the Sun periodically. However, there are a few comets that escape and move out of the Solar System. Few other comets get broken up, or fall into the Sun or other planets when they approach them.12.4 The Milky Way Galaxy\nIn the moonless night sky, viewed from dark locations away from city lights, one can see an extended faint band of light from near north to south across the sky (Fig. 12.11). This is our home galaxy called the Milky Way Galaxy or Ākāśha Gangā. A galaxy has millions to billions of stars. Our Solar System is part of the Milky Way Galaxy.  \nFig. 12.10: A Comet\nWe have learnt about the \nobjects which form the Solar System. Which are these objects? The Sun, eight planets, their moons, and many smaller objects including asteroids, and comets, together form the Solar System.\nThe Sun—our star—is the \nlargest and the heaviest object in the Solar System. The Sun produces almost all the energy in the Solar System. All other objects in our Solar System shine due to the sunlight that they reflect from their surfaces. \n12.5 The Universe\nThere are many galaxies in the outer space beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. Scientists study them to understand the stars, galaxies and the universe.\nIn Sanskrit and a \nfew other Indian languages, a comet is called Dhūmaketu. Various tribes in India also call it Pucchya- Taro  \n(star with a tail) or Zendya-Taro  (star like a flag). \nIn many cultures, comets have been feared and it was earlier believed that comets bring bad luck. However, thanks to scientists, we now know that these are just icy-rocky visitors making a trip close to the Sun!  \nOne famous comet is the \nHalley’s Comet which appears every 76 years. Its last appearance was in 1986.\nMore to \nknow!\nWhat is \nbeyond the \nSolar System?\nChapter 12.indd   246 10/4/2024   3:11:07 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBeyond Earth24712.4 The Milky Way Galaxy\nIn the moonless night sky, viewed from dark locations away \nfrom city lights, one can see an extended faint band of light from near north to south across the sky (Fig. 12.11).

The title of this book not only drives our journey through the amazing world of science, but also defines what it means to be human. As a species, we are curious. We want to find out more about the world we live in and worlds beyond. By now, you have perhaps read a little bit about the world of plants and animals, done some fun activities, learnt about how we measure, wondered about the stars that shine in the night sky, and so on. But remember, this is just the beginning. Science is a never-ending adventure, with new discoveries coming up all the time. And as you progress through the Middle Stage, the things you come across will help you find out even more about the world around you. The key lies in that curiosity you have nurtured throughout this journey.  Keep observing the world around you, keep asking questions, and do not be afraid to experiment. Remember, even the most groundbreaking discoveries often begin with a simple “Why?”. There are countless questions waiting to be answered, and countless answers waiting to be questioned. You, my young scientist, can find them out. So, go forth and explore! And see you again in the next Grade for more adventures in science!\nChapter 12.indd   253 10/4/2024   3:11:56 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n254Notes\nChapter 12.indd   254 10/4/2024   3:11:56 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n"}

We start exploring our surroundings and asking questions right from our childhood. Did you enjoy discovering and exploring the world around you in the Preparatory Stage of school? As you enter the Middle Stage, we will continue this fascinating journey, trying to explore and understand the beautiful world we live in. And for that, we have a new subject, Science. Welcome to the wonderful world of Science! \nScience is a way of thinking, observing and \ndoing things to understand the world we live in and to uncover the secrets of the universe. Think of it as a big adventure—we ask questions, explore the world and try to understand how things work. For this, the most important thing is to have ‘Curiosity’, which is where the title of this book comes from.\nWhether it is studying tiny grains of sand or massive \nmountains, a leaf of grass or a vast forest, there is always something new and exciting to discover. Have you ever looked up at the night sky and wondered why the stars shine? Or watched a flower bloom and wondered how it knows when to open? \nThese are just a few of \nthe many mysteries that science helps us unravel. The most wonderful thing about science is that it is everywhere. From the depths of the ocean to the \nWhat is \nScience??\nA mountainous region\nChapter 1.indd   1 10/4/2024   3:18:10 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 62Science is like a giant and unending jigsaw puzzle. Every \nnew discovery we make adds another piece to that puzzle. \nAnd you know the best thing about this puzzle? There is no limit to what we can discover, since every new piece of knowledge leads to more questions and more things to find out. Sometimes, we find that a piece of this puzzle has been put  in the wrong place and needs to be moved. New discoveries often change our understanding of the world. \nAs you go through this book, you will encounter \ninteresting ideas, do some thought-provoking experiments, and see how some of what we will find out is useful in our vastness of outer space, from what is cooking in the kitchen \nto what is happening on the playground, some of the most groundbreaking discoveries have often come from unexpected places. \nA Desert\n A Coast\nAn underwater view of an Ocean A Galaxy\nChapter 1.indd   2 10/4/2024   3:19:00 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Wonderful World of Science3daily lives. And guess what happens as we \ndiscover more and more? We start realising that these ideas are all connected.\nWe will start off by looking at our \nhome, planet Earth. It is the only planet we know that supports life, and it has an environment that we must protect. There is an amazing variety of life on Earth—plants and animals that have managed to survive and thrive in different regions on this planet. You might have seen a seed grow into a plant, a caterpillar transform into a beautiful butterfly and many more such observations. How do these plants and animals grow?\nWhat will we \nexplore with the help of this book? ?\nOf course, to grow, we need food to eat, and especially in \na large and diverse country like India, food is so fascinating. \nAcross the country, we have different cuisines with their many tasty dishes.

What are they made of? Are they made of different materials? How do we separate different materials from one another?Along with food, we need water to survive. Water is such a \ndelightful substance. Have you ever jumped in a puddle when it rained? Do you ever wonder why and how it rains?\nHave you noticed that water freezes and becomes ice \nwhen we cool it and boils and becomes steam when we heat it? Do you enjoy drinking cool water in the summer or showering with warm water in the winter? How do we understand hot and cold? Whether it is water, or our own body when we have fever, finding out how hot something is can be important!\nChapter 1.indd   4 10/18/2024   9:49:27 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Wonderful World of Science\n5We will have an almost unending list of questions about \neverything on Earth as we further explore this book. But \nwhy limit our questions to the Earth alone? We can ask questions on things beyond—the Sun, the Moon, and the millions of stars that shine in the sky!\nWhether you are learning about the \nstructure of a leaf, discovering how things move, or separating the skin of a peanut seed, we hope each chapter of this book will ignite your spirit of inquiry. And hopefully you will have lots of questions on your mind!\nEven though you may have not realised, \nyou have already been fi  nding answers to many of your questions. Suppose your pen stops writing. What would you do? You would ask yourself the question, “Why did my pen stop writing?” You might guess that the ink fi  nished. \nYou would then test this guess by opening the \npen and checking the ink refi  ll. If it is empty, you would know that your guess was correct. But suppose you found that the ink was not fi  nished. Now what would you do? You would make another guess—perhaps the ink might have dried up. To test if this guess is correct or not, you will try something else. \nThis is exactly how Science \nworks!

Maniram chacha is an expert in mimicking bird calls. He is also brilliant at identifying a variety of plants and animals. \nTo prepare them for the nature walk, Dr Raghu informs \nthe students that the objective of this walk is to experience the beauty and variety of plants and animals in the nature. The students are excited to join them. They are curious to interact and learn from them. The teacher advises the students to carry a notebook, a pen and a water bottle.\nAs they walk, they begin exploring the plants and animals \naround them. Dr Raghu advises the students to notice the variety of smells in the park and emphasises respecting all living creatures and observing them without disturbing. Maniram chacha tells the students to not only observe different \nplants and animals but also to carefully listen to different sounds. The students come across a variety of plants, including grasses, bushes, and large trees. They also observe a variety of birds sitting on the branches of trees, butterflies moving from flower to flower and monkeys jumping from one tree to another. They record their observations in their notebooks and discuss them with Dr Raghu and Maniram chacha.\nThe students can hear the chirping of birds. Dr Raghu \ninforms them that each bird has a unique chirp. This is an example of diversity in nature. Dr Raghu requests Maniram chacha to mimic calls of some birds.

What do you think are the reasons behind it? Different students might have chosen different common features for the grouping. For example, some students may have chosen the height of plants as the basis for grouping while others might have chosen presence or absence of flowers as the basis for grouping of plants (See Fig. 2.2). You may have grouped animals based on varied features, \nsuch as what they eat, where they live, what colour they are and how they move.\nWhat is the importance of grouping?

How \ncan you group plants as herbs, shrubs, and trees based on the data entered in Table 2.3? \nSome plants grow really tall and have \nhard, thick, brown, and woody stems. Their branches typically start higher up on the stem and away from the ground. These plants are called trees. For example, a mango tree (Fig. 2.3a).Table 2.3: Grouping of plants based on height and nature of stem\nChapter 2.indd   16 10/4/2024   3:19:51 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDiversity in the Living World\n17Fig. 2.4: Leaves showing different types of venation\n(a) Hibiscus leaf with \nreticulate venation\n(b) Banana leaf with \nparallel venation\n(c) Grass leaf with \nparallel venationSome plants are not as tall as trees. These plants often \nhave many brown woody stems that start branching very \nclose to the ground. These stems are hard but not as thick as the stem of a tree. These plants are called shrubs. For example, a rose plant is a shrub (Fig.\n 2.3b).\nSome plants are typically small with soft and green \nstems. \nThese are known as herbs. For example, a tomato plant is a herb (Fig. 2.3c).\nSome plants with weak stems need support to climb and \ngrow, and are called climbers. Some plants creep along the ground and are called creepers.\nWhat can be other features on the basis of which you can \ngroup plants? Let us perform another activity.\nActivity 2.5: Let us compare\n Look at the leaves of different plants collected by you, \nduring the nature walk. \n Do you notice any variation in the shape and structure of these leaves?\nYou may observe thin lines on the leaves of the plants  \n(Fig. 2.4a). These are veins. The pattern of veins on the leaf \nis called venation. What differences do you see in the veins of leaves shown in Fig. 2.4a and Fig. 2.4b?\nIn some leaves, you can observe a net-like pattern of \nveins on both sides of a thick middle vein. This pattern is \ncalled reticulate venation. For example, leaves of hibiscus \nexhibit reticulate venation (Fig. 2.4a). In some leaves, you may observe that the veins run parallel. This pattern is called parallel venation. For example, the leaves of banana plants \nand grasses exhibit parallel venation (Fig. 2.4b and Fig. 2.4c).\nChapter 2.indd   17 10/4/2024   3:19:52 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n18Do you think that plants can be grouped on the basis of \nvenation present in their leaves?\nNow, let us try to explore roots of the plants. Do all plants \nhave roots? Are these roots similar? \nActivity 2.6: Let us find out\n Visit an open area where wild herbs and grasses are \ngrowing. You may use small herbs for this exercise. \n Using a khurpi (trowel), carefully dig out a few different \nherbs without damaging the roots. To do this, you may wet the soil and loosen it. \n Wash the roots with water and observe them. \n After you are done observing, make sure to replant the herbs so that they may continue to thrive and grow.\nWhat are the similarities and differences in the roots of \nthe plants collected by you? What differences do you see in \nthe roots of plants shown in Fig. 2.5a and Fig. 2.5b?\nCarefully observe the roots of a mustard plant in  \nFig. 2.5a. The roots of this plant consist of one main root \nand small side roots arising from it. The main root is called taproot. Another example of a plant having taproots is hibiscus observed by you in Activity 2.1. The plant in  \nFig. 2.5b is a common grass plant. The roots of this plant appear as a bunch of similar-sized thin roots arising from the base of the stem. Such roots are called fibrous roots (Fig. 2.5b). Does your collection include any other grasses? \nWhat kind of roots do they have?

How do we find \nthis out?\nActivity 2.7: Let us relate and analyse\n  Collect saplings of five common plants from your school \nnursery or any other nurseries to plant in your school garden. Examples of such plants can include lemongrass, marigold, sadabahar (periwinkle), and others. \n Before planting them, observe their roots and the venation in their leaves. \n Record your observations in Table 2.4. \nTable 2.4: Types of leaf venation and roots\nS. no.

A sadabahar plant has \na taproot and its leaves have reticulate venation. Do other plants with reticulate venation have taproots too? Lemongrass, on the other hand, has fibrous roots and its leaves have parallel venation. Do other plants with parallel venation have fibrous roots too? Generally, plants with reticulate venation have taproots while those with parallel venation have fibrous roots. \nChickpea  (chana) is another example of a plant with \ntaproots and reticulate venation in leaves. Wheat is an example of a\n plant with fibrous \nroots and parallel venation \nin its  leaves. \nChapter 2.indd   19 10/4/2024   3:19:55 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n20Is there any relation among the seed of a plant, types of \nroot and leaf venation?

Now, observe the structure of the chickpea and maize seeds. Are they similar or different?\nYou would notice that chickpea seeds are split into two \nparts (Fig. 2.6a). Each part is called a cotyledon. Plants that \nhave seeds with two cotyledons are called dicotyledons \n(dicots). Maize has a single thin cotyledon (Fig. 2.6b). Plants with such seeds are called monocotyledons (monocots). \nWhat relation do you observe among leaf venation, root \ntypes and the number of cotyledons in seeds of a plant? Dicot plants have reticulate venation and a taproot system while monocot plants have parallel venation and a fibrous \nroot system.\nYou have learnt about some features used for grouping \nplants. Now, let us explore the grouping of animals in more detail.\n2.2.2  How to group animals?\nJust like plants, animals too are significantly different from one another. How can we group such a wide variety of animals? What features can you think of to group them? In Activity 2.3, you have already set some bases for grouping animals. Let us explore a few of these in more detail.Fig. 2.6: Dicot and monocot seeds\n(b) Monocot seed (maize) (a) Dicot seed (chickpea)\nCotyledons\nChapter 2.indd   20 10/4/2024   3:19:55 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDiversity in the Living World\n21Fig. 2.7: Diversity in animals\nIs there any relation among the seed of a plant, types of \nroot and leaf venation?

You may have also observed how other animals move from place to place. Let us now think about the types of movement in animals. A number of animals are shown in Fig. 2.7. You can add more animals that you may have observed and create a poster on the variety of animals. Which body parts are used by the animals in the poster you created and those in Fig. 2.7 for movement?\n List these animals in Table 2.5. \n Note the ways in which these animals move and name \nthe body parts used for movement. Some examples are given in Table 2.5.\nChapter 2.indd   21 10/4/2024   3:19:56 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n22Table 2.5: Movements in animals and their body parts involved\nS. no.

They may use wings, legs, and other parts that help them to move. Here, we have identified animals based on the types of movement and the body parts used for movement. How can we group animals based on their movements? Additionally, many animals differ from each other in shape, size, structure, colour , and other features. Some of these features can also be used to group animals in various ways. Like plants, grouping of animals is important \nfor understanding their diversity.\nJanaki Ammal (1897–1984) was an Indian \nbotanist dedicated to environmental work and helped to document and preserve India’s rich  \nplant biodiversity. She played a key role in the ‘Save Silent Valley’ movement. As the head of the Botanical Survey \nof India, she initiated \nprogrammes to document the plant diversity of India.\nKnow a scientist\nChapter 2.indd   22 10/21/2024   9:59:16 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDiversity in the Living World\n23\nMore to \nknow!Success Story—Save Silent Valley Movement\nThis is a real story of a forest in the Palakkad district of \nKerala. It is about preserving untouched beauty of a moist evergreen forest and its rich biodiversity. The now-famous Silent Valley was saved by a remarkable movement led by common people who were not even residing in the vicinity of the forest. The battle against the proposal of a hydroelectric dam across the Kunthipuzha river persisted for 10 years. At that time, people used all possible available means, such as widespread awareness programmes, letters to editors, articles in, newspapers, seminars, and petitions and appeals in court. The movement was successful in saving the Silent Valley.\n2.3\t Plants \tand\tAnimals\tin\tDifferent \t\nSurroundings \nYou might have observed during nature walks that \ndifferent animals live in different surroundings.  \nYou have also recorded movement of animals in Table 2.5. Does the movement of \nthese animals depend upon their \nsurroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. Fishes live in water . They have streamlined bodies and fins for movement in water (Fig. 2.8a). Goats live in grassy areas and move with the help of legs (Fig. 2.8b). The sizes and shapes of animals also differ from one another .\nFig. 2.8: Body parts used by animals for movement(b) A goat walks on the ground \nwith the help of legs\nLegs\n(a) A fish swims in water \nwith the help of fins\nFins\nChapter 2.indd   23 10/21/2024   9:59:39 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n24S. \nno.In the \ndesertOn \nmountainsIn the \noceanIn the \nforestAny other \nregion\n1.

A few examples are given.

Discuss your observations with your classmates.\nYou might observe from Table \n2.6 that the plants and animals found in one kind of region are different from those found in another kind of region. \nFig. 2.9: Cactus with thick and \nfleshy stems in a desert \nFig. 2.10: A deodar \ntree in the mountains\nDuring a discussion in the classroom, \nAlex recalls that he observed cactus plants with thick and fleshy stems in the deserts of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.9). Maya shares that she saw deodar trees in the Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh (Fig. 2.10). These trees are conical in shape and have flexible and sloping branches. \nNotice that these two types of plants \nfound in different regions are different \nChapter 2.indd   24 10/21/2024   9:59:42 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDiversity in the Living World\n25from each other . Why is it so? Why does the biodiversity of \na region vary from that of another? Let us find out.\nThere is very little water available in the deserts. A hot \ndesert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at night. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these areas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions during the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems of plants found in the desert can store water and help them tolerate the hot conditions in these places. \nThe mountains in extremely cold regions experience \nfrequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, some of the trees have the ability to let the snow slide off  easily. Conical shape and sloping branches of deodar trees enable them to do so easily.\nYou must have understood by now that the biodiversity \nvaries from region to region because of diverse conditions.\nLook at the images of a camel from the hot desert of \nRajasthan (Fig. 2.11) and a camel from the cold desert of Ladakh (Fig. 2.12). What are the differences you observe between them? What advantages do these differences provide to these camels?\nThe camel of the hot desert has long legs with wide hooves. \nAlex shares that his grandmother told him that the long legs and wide hooves help these camels to walk on the sandy desert without sinking into the sand. On the other hand, the height and legs of camels of a cold desert are comparatively shorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs allow them to walk easily in mountainous regions.\nFig. 2.11: A camel living in the hot \ndesert of Rajasthan\nHooves\nFig. 2.12: A camel living in the \ncold desert of Ladakh\nHooves\nChapter 2.indd   25 10/21/2024   9:59:45 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n26In deserts, food is not available easily. Camels store food \nin their humps. Camels found in the hot desert have one \nhump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of food. Camels found in the cold desert have two humps each. These two humps shrink in late winters because there is not much food available in the cold desert and they have to use food stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they grow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive the cold winters of Ladakh. \nWhat other features can help camels to survive in the \ndesert?\nOther students also start sharing their observations. \nKashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete small \namounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do not sweat. As camels do not lose much water from their bodies, they can survive for many days without drinking water. \nMaya talks about seeing plants with beautiful bright \nflowers, rhododendrons, in the Shola forests of Nilgiris. \nHere, rhododendrons are of shorter height and have smaller leaves to survive through the heavy winds on mountain tops. However, Pema, who is from Sikkim, mentions that she has observed rhododendrons in the nearby \nmountains to \nbe taller (Fig. 2.13). So, even plants such as rhododendrons \nmay exhibit different features in different regions to survive the conditions of those regions.\nSagar tells his classmates that he went to the Andaman \nand Nicobar Islands with his parents for a special event. He saw huge whales and colourful fish in the ocean. His father explained that the streamlined body of fish helps them to swim in water. \nFig. 2.13: Different features of rhododendrons\nChapter 2.indd   26 19-Dec-24   12:42:18 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDiversity in the Living World\n27We have learnt that the plants and animals living in a \nparticular region have special features that make them fit \nto survive there. The special features that enable plants and animals to survive in a particular region are called adaptations.\nThe shape of the deodar tree and the height of the \nrhododendron are adaptations that enable them to survive in the mountainous regions. \nThe place where plants and animals live is called their \nhabitat. For example, the habitat of sea turtles is the sea or the ocean. The habitat of a camel is the hot or the cold desert, and the habitat of a rhododendron is the mountains. The habitat of plants and animals provides them food, water , air , shelter and other needs for their survival. Many types of plants and animals may share the same habitat. Habitat plays an important role in shaping the biodiversity of a region.\nWhat are the different ways in which you can group \nplants and animals based on their habitats? One way is to group them into those ‘that live on land’ and those ‘that live in water’. \nThe plants and animals that live on land are said to live in \nterrestrial habitats. Some examples of terrestrial habitats are forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains.Salim Ali (1896–1987) travelled across India \nto observe diversity in birds. He prepared a list of birds and documented their travel routes and habitats. He recorded the regions with high diversity of birds and took measures to conserve these regions. Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur , Rajasthan and Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary in Mandya, Karnataka are examples of regions he preserved. He wrote a landmark series of 10 books on birds of the Indian Subcontinent. He is referred to as the ‘Birdman of India’. He was awarded Padma Vibhushan in 1976.\nKnow a scientist\nChapter 2.indd   27 10/21/2024   9:59:50 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n28The plants and animals that live in water are said to live \nin aquatic habitats. Some examples of aquatic habitats are \nponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSome animals, such as frogs, can live in water as well as \non land. These are called amphibians.\nWhat would happen if the habitat of a plant or an animal \nis damaged? What would happen if a goat does not get grass \nto eat? Can a fish survive without water? \nCheck with your parents, grandparents, and neighbours \nto know about the plants, birds, insects or any other animal they used to see frequently in their childhood but do not see as often now. These changes often happen when habitats are damaged. The damage to habitats of plants and animals results in loss of their homes, food, and other resources. This leads to the loss of biodiversity.\nThe population of the Bengal Tiger , Cheetah, and Great Indian \nBustard has declined in India due to loss of natural habitats caused by human activities. The Government of India has initiated several projects to conserve our biodiversity. ‘Project Tiger’ was initiated in 1973 to protect the declining population of the Bengal Tiger . The ‘Cheetah Reintroduction Project’ was initiated in 2022 to restore the population of the Cheetah. Similarly, habitats of the Great Indian Bustards have been declared as Protected areas in the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra.\nBengal Tiger        Cheetah        Great Indian Bustard\n Do you \nknow?\nChapter 2.indd   28 10/21/2024   10:00:13 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDiversity in the Living World\n29\nKeywords\nMore to \nknow!Traditionally Protected Forests: Sacred Groves\nSacred groves are undisturbed patches of forests.

How do you \nfeel when you miss a meal?\nWe feel tired and less energetic when we do not \neat for some time. Why do you think a marathon runner drinks glucose water during and after a race?\nGlucose provides instant \nenergy. Glucose is an example of \na carbohydrate. Carbohydrates  \nare one of the primary sources of energy in our diet. Cereals like wheat, rice, and maize, vegetables like potato and sweet potato, and fruits like banana, pineapple, and mango are some sources of carbohydrates (Fig. 3.2).\nDo you know that common \nsugar is also a type of carbohydrate?\nWhy do you think we prefer to have laddoos as a part of \nour traditional diet in winters? \nBesan or wheat flour (aata ) and ghee \nare among the main ingredients of laddoos along with goond (edible \ngum), nuts, and seeds. Ghee and various kinds of oils are grouped under another kind of food component, which is called fat.\nYes, my grandma told \nme that laddoos rich in \nghee and nuts provide \nenergy to keep us warm. \nSources of fats can be from \nplants or animals (Fig. 3.3). Nuts, \nsuch as groundnuts, walnuts, \ncoconuts, and almonds, and \nseeds, such as pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds, are some sources of fat. Fat is a source of stored\n energy.\nFig. 3.2: Some sources of carbohydratesPotato Sugarcane Banana\nPineappleSweet  \npotato\nWheat\nRice\nBajra MaizeMango\nChapter 3.indd   40 10/4/2024   3:17:26 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMindful Eating: A Path \nto a Healthy Body41Carbohydrates and fats provide us energy for performing \nvarious activities.

People get proteins from plants as well as animals. Some excellent plant \nsources of protein are pulses, beans, \npeas and nuts (Fig. 3.4a). Animal sources of protein are milk, paneer, egg, fish and meat (Fig. 3.4b). Protein-rich foods help \nin growth and repair of our body. These are, therefore, called body-building foods. \nFig. 3.4: Some sources of proteins(a) Plant sources\nGramMoong Tuar Dal Kidney beans\nPeas\nSoya bean\n (b) Animal sources\nFish EggsPaneerChicken\nChapter 3.indd   41 10/4/2024   3:18:02 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 642\nCase 1\nIn earlier times, during long voyages, sailors often suffered \nfrom bleeding and swollen gums. During a voyage in 1746, Scottish physician James Lind observed that sailors who consumed lemons and oranges recovered from these symptoms. Bleeding and swollen gums are symptoms of a disease called scurvy.\nCase 2\nIn the 1960s, Indian scientists found that among the \nhuman population in the Himalayan region and the Northern plains of India, symptoms of swelling at the front of the neck were prevalent. As per norms of the Government of India, an effort was made to supplement common salt with iodine for preparing iodised salt. Consumption of iodised \nsalt visibly reduced the above symptoms. These symptoms were due to a deficiency of iodine in the soil of this region resulting in a lack of iodine in the local food and water supply. Swelling at the front of the neck is a symptom of a disease called goitre.\nThe right amount of protein must be included in the diet of \ngrowing children for their proper growth and development. \nWhich of these food components are part of your daily diet?\nHave you ever seen mushrooms? They grow mostly in dark and moist places. Edible mushrooms are good sources of protein.  \nMushroomMore to \nknow!\nWhy do you think we are advised to include servings of \nfruits, vegetables and other plant-based foods in our daily \ndiet? Let us understand the importance of some other food components by reading the following two cases—\nWhat do you interpret by reading Case 1? What cures \nscurvy? Lemons and oranges help in curing scurvy. Scurvy is caused due to deficiency of Vitamin C. Vitamin C present \nin citrus fruits like lemons and oranges helps in curing this disease.\nChapter 3.indd   42 10/4/2024   3:19:26 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMindful Eating: A Path \nto a Healthy Body43How would you find out more about other food \ncomponents that protect our body from various diseases?\nActivity 3.4: Let us conduct a survey\n Study the chart given in Fig. 3.5 to explore the functions \nand sources of various food components. Find out more sources of vitamins and minerals. Also, understand the symptoms of the diseases caused by the lack of these food components.\n Visit your neighbourhood, interact with people and find out if any individual shows the symptoms listed on the\n chart (an investigatory project of this kind can be \ntaken \nby the students under the guidance of a teacher).\n Correlate these symptoms with their diet and identify the deficiency disease(s) or disorder(s). \n Suggest the possible cause(s) for the symptoms observed and changes required in the diet for improvement. \n Suggest them to visit a doctor for further advice. What do you infer from Case 2? \nYou may have learnt about iodised salt through \nnewspapers, advertisements or by reading about it on a  \nsalt packet. What does it mean? Iodised salt is simply  \ncommon salt mixed with required quantities of salts \nof iodine.\nSalt farming is a traditional practice of a tribal \ncommunity named Agariyas. They practice salt \nfarming in the Little Rann of Kutch and other parts of Gujarat. For eight months, they live in the extreme heat of the desert and work very hard to get salt from seawater.\nMore to \nknow!\nChapter 3.indd   43 10/4/2024   3:19:49 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 644Food \ncomponent \n(Vitamin/\nMineral) \n  \nFunctions   \nSome sources \nDeficiency \ndisease/\ndisorder   \nSymptoms\nVitamin AKeeps eyes \nand skin healthyPapaya, carrot, mango, milkLoss of visionPoor vision, loss of vision in darkness (night blindness), sometimes complete loss of vision\nVitamin B\n1Keeps heart healthy and supports body to perform various functionsLegumes, nuts, whole grains, seeds, milk products BeriberiSwelling, tingling or burning sensation in feet and hands, trouble in breathing\nVitamin CHelps body to fight diseasesAmla, guava, green chilli, orange, lemonScurvyBleeding gums, slow healing of wounds\nVitamin DHelps body absorb calcium for bone and teeth  \nhealthExposure to sunlight, milk, butter, fish, eggsRicketsSoft and bent bones\nCalciumKeeps bones and teeth healthyMilk/soya milk, curd, cheese, paneerBone and tooth decayWeak bones, tooth decay\nIodineHelps to perform physical and mental activitiesSeaweed, water chestnut (singhada), \niodised saltGoitreSwelling at the front of the neck\nIronImportant component of bloodGreen leafy vegetables, beetroot, pomegranateAnaemiaWeakness, shortness of breath\nFig. 3.5: Chart of vitamins and minerals, their functions, some sources, \nrelated deficiency disease(s)/disorder(s) and symptoms\nChapter 3.indd   44 10/4/2024   3:19:49 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMindful Eating: A Path \nto a Healthy Body45From Fig. 3.5, you have learnt that vitamins (A, B1, C \nand D) and minerals (calcium, iodine, and iron) are two \ngroups of food components that protect our body from various diseases.

The major nutrients in our food include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals.\nVitamins and minerals are also called protective \nnutrients. These nutrients protect our body from diseases and  \nkeep us healthy. Your parents may have advised you to have \nChapter 3.indd   45 10/4/2024   3:19:54 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 646\nmilk, green vegetables, fruits and wholegrains regularly. \nThese food items are some sources of vitamins (Fig.  3.6) and \nmi\nnerals. Although vitamins and minerals are required in \nsmall amounts, they are essential to keep our body healthy. \nWhat differences do you observe in raw and cooked \nvegetables? Have you ever noticed that vegetables sometimes lose their bright colour, or become softer and less crisp when cooked? Some nutrients like vitamin C and others are lost during cooking due to high heat. Would it not be wise to include fruits and uncooked vegetables into our diet? Washing cut or peeled vegetables and fruits may also result in the loss of some vitamins. However, it is highly recommended that all fruits and vegetables be thoroughly washed before consumption. \nFruits and vegetables are rich in dietary fibres. Let us see how dietary fibres are beneficial for us.\nIn\n addition to the essential nutrients, our body needs dietary \nfibres and water. Dietary fibres, also known as roughage, do \nnot provide any nutrients to our body. However, they are an essential component of our food. They help our body get rid of undigested food and ensure smooth passage of stools. Roughage in ou\nr food is provi ded mainly by suitable plant products. \nDo we obtain all \nnutrients from \nplants and animals?No, Medu. Nutrients like \nsalt can be obtained from \nseawater or from rocks. \nAlso, Vitamin D can be \nnaturally produced by our \nbody upon exposure to \nsunlight.\nChapter 3.indd   46 10/4/2024   3:19:56 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMindful Eating: A Path \nto a Healthy Body47Green leafy vegetables, \nfresh fruits, wholegrains, pulses and nuts are good sources of roughage.  \nEating food that is \nlocally grown and plant based, to the extent possible, is not only healthy for the body but is also good for our environment and our planet. \nWater is also an essential \npart of our diet. It helps the body absorb nutrients from \nfood. It removes waste from the body through sweat and urine. We should drink sufficient water regularly to \nkeep ourselves healthy.My grandma has difficulty in \npassing stool. Now I understand \nwhy the doctor advised her to \neat food that is high in fibre.\nColuthur Gopalan (1918–2019) initiated \nnutrition research in India. He analysed more than 500 Indian foods for their nutritional value and recommended an appropriate diet in the Indian context. He led surveys on the nutritional status of the Indian population, identifying widespread deficiencies in protein, energy, and other food components. This led to the implementation of the Mid Day Meal Programme in 2002, now a ‘PM POSHAN’ initiative, to provide balanced food in the government-run and government-aided schools of our country. This scheme has played a role in improving the health and nutrition of millions of children nationwide.\nKnow a scientist\nWhat are the \nfood sources that provide water to our body?

Why? \nSome foods have high calories due to high sugar and \nfat content. Moreover, they contain very low amounts of proteins, minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibres. These foods are called junk foods. These foods include potato wafers, candy bars and carbonated drinks. Consuming these foods frequently is not good as these are not healthy for our body. They make a person obese. Such a person may suffer from several health problems.

Her grandmother loves listening to her stories, so Reshma was writing a new story to share with her grandmother on her 60th birthday. \nExploring Magnets\nThe story was based on a ship \ncarrying spices from Kerala for trade in the olden days. Reshma was aware that in those days, the sailors used stars to find directions at night. But in her story, a situation arose wherein the sailors got caught in a storm with an overcast sky and stars were not visible. Reshma could not take her story forward as she could not think of a way for sailors to find directions.  \nShe searched for information on the internet and her \nschool library.\n She learnt that the tr\navellers used a device, \nknown as a magnetic compass, for finding \ndirections.  \nReshma had seen pencil boxes and \npurses which had magnets to keep them \nclosed. A writing board in her school also had a duster with a magnet. But \nshe had never looked at those carefully. \nShe now became curious to learn more \nabout magnets and magnetic compasses.\nChapter 4.indd   61 10/4/2024   3:16:10 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe magnets used by sailors in the olden days were based \non naturally occurring magnets, known as lodestones which \nwere discovered in ancient times. Later on, people found out that magnets could also be made from pieces of iron. \nNow\nadays, we have magnets made of different materials. \nThe magnets that you find in your school laboratory and \nthose used in pencil boxes, stickers, toys are all artificial magnets (Fig. 4.1). The magnets can be of various shapes, some of which are shown in Fig. 4.2.Fig. 4.1: Some common items that have magnets attached to them\n4.1 Magnetic and Non-magnetic Materials \nActivity 4.1: Let us explore\n Collect a few objects made of different materials and \nalso a magnet. \n Predict which of the objects will stick to the magnet.

If a magnet is broken into smaller pieces, North and South poles always exist in pairs even in the smallest piece of the magnet. A single North pole or a South pole cannot exist.\n4.3 Finding Directions\nActivity 4.3: Let us experiment\n Suspend a bar magnet with a thread tied to the middle of \nthe magnet as shown in Fig. 4.5. You may need to adjust the position of the string till the magnet is balanced horizontally.\n Now rotate the magnet gently in the horizontal direction and let it come to rest. \n Mark the position corresponding to the ends of the magnet on the ground (or on a piece of paper stuck to the ground). Join these two points on the ground with a line. This line indicates the direction along which the magnet comes to rest. \n Now again rotate the magnet by giving a gentle push at its one end and wait till it comes to rest. Does the magnet rest along the same line?Fig. 4.5: A freely suspended \nbar magnet\nCan we find \na magnet with a single pole??\nWhat direction does \nthis line indicate \nalong which the \nmagnet rests? How \ncan we find it out?\nExploring Magnets\n65\nChapter 4.indd   65 10/4/2024   3:19:56 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA freely suspended magnet comes to rest along the \nnorth-south direction. The end of the magnet that points \ntowards north direction is called the North-seeking pole or the North pole of the magnet. The other end that points \ntowards the South direction is called the South-seeking pole or the South pole of the magnet. A freely suspended magnet rests along the north-south direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet.\nRepeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of \nthe bar magnet. What do you observe? Does it always rest along north-south direction? It does not. It can rest along any direction. This implies that only magnets rest along north-south direction. This activity provides us with a way to test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not. \nThe property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest \nalong the north-south direction is used to find directions. Based on this, a small device called a magnetic compass was \ndeveloped in olden days for finding directions. It has a magnet in the shape of a needle which can rotate freely (Fig.\n 4.6). The needle of a magnetic \ncompass indicates the north-south direction.\nThe compass is kept at the place where we \nwish \nto know the directions. After some time, the \nneedle comes to rest in the north-south direction. \nThe compass box is then gently rotated until the \nnorth and south marked on the dial are aligned with the needle. Now all directions at that place are as indicated on the dial.\nA magnetic compass is usually a small circular box \nwith a transparent cover on it, as shown in Fig. 4.6. The magnet, in the shape of a needle, is mounted on a pin standing on the bottom of the box. This \nneedle is balanced on the pin in such a \nmanner that it can move around this point \neasily, that is, it can rotate freely. The end of the needle which rests in the North direction is usually painted red. Below the needle, there is a dial with directions marked on it. How can we \nmake our \nown magnetic \ncompass?\nMore to \nknow!\nFig. 4.6: A magnetic  \ncompass\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n66\nChapter 4.indd   66 10/4/2024   3:20:26 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nActivity 4.4: Let us construct\n Collect a few materials like a cork piece, iron sewing \nneedle, a permanent bar magnet, a glass bowl, and water.\n Place the iron sewing needle on a wooden table. Then keep any one pole of the magnet at one end of the needle. Move the magnet over the needle along its length as shown in Fig.\n 4.7a. When it \nreaches the other end of the needle, lift it up. \n Bring the same pole of the magnet you started with to the same end of the sewing needle from which you began, and repeat the previous step. Repeat this process at least 30 to 40 times. \n Bring some iron filings or steel pins near the needle.  \nIf the pins or iron filings get attracted to the needle, then that means that the needle has become  \na magnet.  \n Pass this needle through the cork horizontally. Float the cork in a glass bowl filled with water, such that the needle always remains above the level of water as shown in Fig. 4.7b. \n When the needle comes to rest, your magnetic compass is ready for use. Note the direction in which either side of the needle points. \n Rotate the cork gently and wait till it stops rotating. Repeat this a few more times. Do the ends of the needle always point in the same direction?\nFig. 4.7(a): Making an iron \nneedle a magnet\nFig. 4.7(b): A compass needle \nin a bowl of water\nMuch before the widespread use of the modern \nmagnetic compass (Fig. 4.6), a device similar to the compass needle made by you (Fig.\n 4.7b) was \nused by Indians for navigation at\n \nsea.

Does the magnet A on the pencils begin to move? Does it always move in the direction of the approaching magnet? What do these observations suggest?\nYou will see that unlike poles of two magnets, that is, the \nNorth pole of one magnet and the South pole of another \nmagnet, attract each other.

The new school \nyear has started. Deepa needs a new uniform \nsince she has grown taller. Her mother takes \nher to a cloth shop. She asks for a two-metre \ncloth piece. The shopkeeper measures the \ncloth using a metal measuring rod.\nThen, the tailor takes her measurements \nusing a flexible measuring tape. Her mother \ninstructs the tailor to increase the length of her \nuniform by char angula (four fingers width).\nAre \nthe tape and rod \nsimilar to the scale that the \nelder sister has in her geometry \nbox? What did mother mean \nby char angula?\nDeepa shares her experience with her school friends \nAnish, Hardeep, Padma, Tasneem and this leads to a \ndiscussion amongst them. \nChapter 5.indd   79 10/4/2024   3:15:23 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6805.1 How do we Measure?\nHardeep says, “I have seen my grandmother measuring \ncloth by the length of her arm.”\n“Have you ever seen how a farmer measures length to \ndivide his field into beds? He walks and counts the number \nof his strides,” says Padma.\n“Oh, not just the length of the strides—sometimes they \nalso use the length of their feet to measure,” adds Anish.\nDeepa says excitedly, “Measuring length using body parts \nmust be so much fun! Let us also measure something using a body part.” \n“What should we measure? Okay, let us \nmeasure the length of the table in our classroom,” says Tasneem.\nPadma adds, “And which body part should \nwe use to measure it?”\nDeepa says, “Let us use our handspan. I will \nshow you how to use it. I have seen my mother using it. She calls it balisht.”\nHardeep adds, “Okay. Let us also note down \nour measurements.” \nFig. 5.1: Use of handspan  \nfor measuringDeepaPadma\nTasneemAnish Hardeep\nChapter 5.indd   80 10/4/2024   3:15:25 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMeasurement of Length and Motion81Padma says, “Oh, the number of handspans is different for \nall of us. So, what can we say about the length of the table?”\n“But why should the number be different?” Hardeep \nasked thoughtfully.\nTasneem says, “I can guess. Our handspans are of \ndifferent sizes.”\nAnish gives an idea, “Let us check this.”\nSo, all five of them put their handspans along each \nother and arrive at the conclusion that the lengths of their handspans are different.\nDeepa says thoughtfully, “No wonder people use scales \nand measuring tapes.”\nDeepa and her friends compare the length of the table \nwith the length of their handspans. The length of the table is expressed in terms of their handspans. Here, the handspan used for measurement is an example of a unit. And the length is expressed in two parts, a number and a unit. For example, if the length of the table is found to be 13 handspans, then 13 is the number and ‘handspan’ is the unit selected for the measurement.\nHowever, handspans and other similar units, such as \nlength of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to person. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which measurements of the same length made by different people do not differ.Table 5.1: Measuring the length of the table\nName of the Student Number of Handspans\nAnish Slightly more than 13\nPadma 13\nTasneem Slightly less than 13\nDeepa Between 13 and 14\nHardeep 14\nChapter 5.indd   81 10/4/2024   3:15:25 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 682\nIndia has a rich history of measurement \nsystems dating back to ancient times.

Several objects with ruled markings which could be scales have been excavated from sites of the Harappan Civilisation. \nMore to \nknow!\nFig. 5.2:  \nA metre scale5.2 Standard Units\nSeveral systems of units evolved with time in \ndifferent parts of the world. However, when people started travelling from one place to another, it created a lot of confusion. This led to the different countries coming together and adopting a set of standard units of measurement. The system of units now used is known as the ‘International System of Units’ or SI units. \nThe SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol \nis\n m. A metre scale \nis shown in Fig. 5.2. One \nmetre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions. Each division is called a centimetre (cm). You may be familiar with a smaller part of the metre scale, typically 15 cm long, shown in Fig. 5.3.\nLook carefully at the 15-cm scale. It has \nmarkings (in\n cm) from 0 to 15. \nThe length \nof any section between two consecutive big marks, such as between 1 and 2 or between 5 and 6, is 1\n cm. Observe that these sections \nChapter 5.indd   82 10/4/2024   3:15:45 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMeasurement of Length and Motion83\nFig. 5.3: A 15-cm scale\nof 1  cm length are further divided \ninto 10 equal parts. \nThe length of \none of these smaller parts is called \na millimetre (mm). 1 mm is the \nsmallest value of length that you can measure using this scale. 1\n mm \nis equal to one-tenth \nof a centimeter \n(1 mm = 0.1 cm).\nFor measuring larger lengths, we \nuse a larger unit called a kilometre (km) which is equal to 1000 metres. And for measuring smaller lengths, we use units such as centimetre or millimetre. \n1 km = 1000 m 1 m = 100 cm 1 cm = 10 mm\nWould it be convenient to use \nthe unit metre to measure larger lengths, such as the length of a railway track between two cities, or to measure smaller lengths, such as the thickness of a page of a book?\n?\nIn some scales, you might have noticed another scale marking. This scale marking is in inches, where  \n1 inch = 2.54 cm. In earlier days, units, such as inch and foot, were used to measure length. These units are still used by some people.\nDo you \nknow?\nChapter 5.indd   83 10/4/2024   3:15:57 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6845.3 Correct Way of Measuring Length\nFor measuring any length, we need an appropriate scale. \nFor example, if you want to measure the length of your pencil, you may use a 15-cm scale. Similarly, if the height of a room is to be measured, you may need a metre scale or a measuring tape. You cannot directly measure the girth of a tree or the size of your chest using a metre scale. For such measurements, flexible measuring tape, such as a tailor’s tape is more suitable. \nWhile measuring lengths, we need to take care of some \npoints. \nWhat is the correct way to place the scale?\nPlace the scale in contact with the object along its length as shown in Fig. 5.4.\nFig. 5.4: Method of placing the scale(b) Incorrect\n (a) Correct\nWhat is the correct position of the eye while reading \nthe scale?\nFor example, if you are trying to measure the length of a \npencil by aligning it with a scale, the position of your eye should be directly above the tip of the pencil (Fig. 5.5).\nNo, but we should \nfirst learn the correct \nway of using a scale \nto measure length.Suppose we all measure \nthe length of the table \nagain, but this time using \na metre scale. Will our \nresults still be different?\nChapter 5.indd   84 10/4/2024   3:16:09 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMeasurement of Length and Motion85How to measure the length if the ends of the scale \nare broken?\nIf the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking \nis not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With \nsuch a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 cm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in Fig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other end, it is 10.4 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is  \n10.4 cm–1.0 cm = 9.4 cm. \nFig. 5.6: Correct method of placing the scale with broken end\nHow do visually challenged students measure lengths? \nThey use scales with raised markings that can be felt by touching them. \nFig. 5.5: Correct position of the eye is ‘B’\nB\nCA\nDo you \nknow?\nChapter 5.indd   85 10/4/2024   3:16:24 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6865.4 Measuring the L ength of a C urved Line\nAnish and his parents fixed electric string lights on the \narches of the verandah of their house, as shown in Fig. 5.7, for a \ncelebration at home. How would they have measured the required length of string lights?\nIn the case of a curved line, \nmeasurements can be made with the help of a flexible measuring tape or by using a thread as shown in Fig. 5.8. \nObject Length of the object\nWhile writing the length, do not forget \nto write the unit also. Thus, your result \nwill consist of two parts—one part is a \nnumber and the other part is the unit of \nmeasurement.\nSome of your friends in the class \nwould have measured the length of the same \nobjects. Compare the lengths measured by you with that of your\n friends. Are the measured lengths the same \nor slightly \ndifferent? If not the same, discuss the possible reasons for the differences.\nWhy are some \nlength measuring \ndevices made \nup of flexible \nmaterials?\nUnits of length, such as kilometre, metre, centimetre and \nmillimetre, begin with a lowercase letter, except at the \nbeginning of a sentence. Their symbols km, m, cm and \nmm are also written in lowercase letters, and are never \nfollowed by ‘s’ for the plural. Note that a full stop is not written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the length, always leave a space between the number and the unit.5.5 Describing Position\nOne day the teacher informs her students that she has \nplanned an educational visit to a nearby garden. She asks the students to reach there directly in the morning. Deepa and her friends start discussing whether the garden would be closer than their school or farther. Tasneem and Padma say that the garden would be closer, while Deepa and Anish feel that the school would be closer, Hardeep thinks that both would be almost at an equal distance (Fig. 5.9).Activity 5.1: Let us measure \n Select some objects around you, such as a comb, a pen, \na pencil, and an eraser to measure their lengths. \n Measure their lengths one by one using a metre scale and note down the measurements in Table 5.2.\nTable 5.2: Measuring lengths \nDo you \nknow?\nChapter 5.indd   86 10/4/2024   3:16:34 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMeasurement of Length and Motion875.4 Measuring the Length of a Curved Line\nAnish and his parents fixed electric string lights on the \narches  of the verandah of their \nhouse, as shown \nin Fig.  5.7, for a \ncelebration at \nhome. How would \nthey have measured the required length of string lights?\nIn the case of a curved line, \nmeasurements can be made with the help of a flexible measuring tape or by using a thread as shown in Fig. 5.8. \nFig. 5.7: House decorated with string lights\nFig. 5.8: Measuring the length of a curved line\n5.5 Describing Position\nOne day the teacher informs her students that she has planned an educational visit to a nearby garden.

If, instead, each of them had thought of distances from a same object or point, say, the bus stand, then their observations would have been the same. \nWhen distance is stated with respect to a fixed object or \npoint, then this point is called a reference point.\nA few days later, Hardeep tells his friends excitedly, \n“Let us all go to the playground. The sports teacher wants \nus to help her to draw lines with chuna powder (limestone \npowder) for making the Kabaddi court for the sports day.” \nPadma: “We will need a longer measuring tape. Let us \ntake it from the sports room.” (Fig. 5.10)\nDeepa: “Let us first decide the point on the ground \nfrom which we will measure the distances to start \ndrawing the lines. Let us call this our reference point.” (Fig.\n 5.11)\nFig. 5.11: Drawing lines for Kabaddi court\nReference \nPoint\nChapter 5.indd   88 10/4/2024   3:16:48 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMeasurement of Length and Motion89After a few days, Padma was travelling \nby bus to visit her grandparents in Delhi. \nShe was eager to reach Delhi and was reading the kilometre stones on the side of the road. On one of the kilometre stones, it was written ‘Delhi 70 km’ (Fig. 5.12).\nFurther on, the next kilometre stone \nread ‘Delhi 60 km’. Each kilometre stone indicated that she was getting closer to her \ngrandparents’ house.\nThese kilometre stones indicated \nher distance from Delhi. So, Delhi is the reference point in this situation.\nFig. 5.13: Positions of kilometre stones with respect to Delhi as a reference point\nIf the kilometre stone reads ‘Delhi 70 km’ as shown in \nFig. 5.13, we can say \nthat the position of Padma is 70 km \nfrom Delhi. When the kilometre stone reads ‘Delhi 60 km’, the position of Padma is 60 km from Delhi.\nWhat do such \nkilometre stones indicate? How could Padma conclude that she was getting closer to her destination? ?\nFig. 5.12:  \nA kilometre stone\nDoes this mean that the position of Padma, with respect to the reference point, is changing with time? When does the position of an object change with respect to a reference point? Does it change when an object is moving? \n?\nChapter 5.indd   89 10/4/2024   3:16:52 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6905.6 Moving Things\nActivity 5.2: Let us explore\n Look around and prepare a list of five objects that are \nin motion and five objects that are at rest. \n Record your observations in Table 5.3.\n Think about how you decided whether an object was in motion or at rest.

How can one decide if an object is in motion or at rest?\nAn object is said to be in motion if its position changes \nwith respect to the reference point with time. If an object is not changing its position with respect to the reference point with time, it is said to be at rest.\nChapter 5.indd   90 10/4/2024   3:16:52 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMeasurement of Length and Motion91\nDeepa looked around her in the bus and noticed that all \nthe passengers were seated. She looked around again after a minute and found them still occupying their seats. She wondered, ‘Are they moving?’ She concluded that the position of the passengers was not changing with time. Therefore, they were certainly at rest. However, when she looked outside, she felt they were in motion as their positions were changing with respect to things outside.\nThe reference point is important in deciding whether an object \nis at rest or in motion. If Deepa considered herself (or the bus) as the reference point, then the passengers were at rest. However, if she considered any object outside the bus (say a building) as the reference point, then the passengers (and the bus) were in motion.\nSuppose you are travelling on a ship which is moving at a constant speed along a straight line on a calm sea.

About 4000 BCE onwards, \nSindhu-Sarasvatī developed techniques of wheel-\nturned pottery production, pigmentation, application \nof protective or decorative coats (called ‘slips’) of \nmultiple colours, decorative painting, etc. These \ntechniques became further sophisticated during the \nSindhu-Sarasvatī (also known as ‘Harappan’) Civilisation \n(2600–1900 BCE), with a bright red surface \npainted with black-coloured designs displaying \ngeometric patterns, and aquatic and terrestrial \nanimals. The clay used for making pots, dishes, \nbowls and other items was carefully selected and cleaned, sieved, kneaded, turned over a wheel and finally baked in kilns (baked clay is called ‘terracotta’). Pots were used for various purposes, from cooking to storage of food grains, oil, ghee, and so on.

Group the collected pieces based on their appearance.\nMaterials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to \nhave a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due to the effect of air and moisture on them. As a result, we often notice the lustre only on their freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous  \nmaterials are those that do not have a shiny surface. Some examples of non-lustrous materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc.\n“All that glitters is not gold” goes an old \nsaying! Not all the materials that shine are metals. \nSurfaces of some materials are made shiny by polishing or coating them with thin layers of plastic, wax or any other material which makes them look shiny. These materials may not be metals. \n6.3.2 Which materials are hard?\nWhen you press different objects or materials with your hands, some of them like stones, may be hard to compress, while others, like an eraser, can be easily compressed. Take a metal key and use it to scratch the surface of a piece of wood, aluminium, stone, iron, candle, chalk and any other \nmaterial or object. Can some materials be scratched more easily than others? Materials which can be compressed or scratched easily are soft, while other materials which are difficult to compress or scratch are hard. However, these \nproperties are relative in nature. For example, rubber is harder than sponge but softer than iron.\nActivity 6.5: Let us observe \n Hold the objects given in Table 6.3 with your hands.\nFeel whether the objects are hard or soft. Find out the materials they are made up of.

Similarly, a grocer usually keeps all types of spices in one corner, pulses and grains in another corner and so on. You may also visit any chemist shop and enquire about how medicines are arranged.\n6.3 What are the d ifferent Properties of  \nMaterials?\nLet us learn some more properties of materials.\n6.3.1  Observe and identify appearance of materials\nMaterials often look different from each other. Freshly cut \nwood, which is unpolished, has a distinct appearance, quite different from that of iron. Similarly, iron looks different from copper or aluminium. However, there might be some similarities among iron, copper and aluminium that make them different from wood.\nLet us do a sorting challenge! Collect small pieces of paper, \ncardboard, wood, chalk, copper wire, aluminium foil and any article made up of brass, bronze, steel, etc. Take a look at the pieces you have collected. Do any of these materials shine when light falls on them? Observe their texture (whether \nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nChapter 6.indd   106 10/4/2024   3:15:23 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n107rough or smooth), colour and other noticeable features, \nand record your observations in the notebook. Group the collected pieces based on their appearance.\nMaterials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to \nhave a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due to the effect of air and moisture on them. As a result, we often notice the lustre only on their freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous  \nmaterials are those that do not have a shiny surface. Some examples of non-lustrous materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc.\n“All that glitters is not gold” goes an old \nsaying! Not all the materials that shine are metals. \nSurfaces of some materials are made shiny by polishing or coating them with thin layers of plastic, wax or any other material which makes them look shiny. These materials may not be metals. \n6.3.2 Which materials are hard?\nWhen you press different objects or materials with your hands, some of them like stones, may be hard to compress, while others, like an eraser, can be easily compressed. Take a metal key and use it to scratch the surface of a piece of wood, aluminium, stone, iron, candle, chalk and any other \nmaterial\n or object. Can some materials be scratched \nmore \neasily than others? Materials which can be compressed or scratched easily are soft, while other materials which are difficult to compress or scratch are hard. However, these \nproperties are relative in nature. For example, rubber is harder than sponge but softer than iron.\nActivity 6.5: Let us observe \n Hold the objects given in Table 6.3 with your hands.\nFeel whether the objects are hard or soft.

Ghulan hides behind a wall, Sheeta hides behind a big tree in the garden while Sara hides behind the frosted glass door (which has a hazy surface). Sheeta’s younger brother can see all of this happening through a glass window of his house. \nThe materials, through which things can be seen clearly, \nare called transparent. Glass, water, air, cellophane paper, etc., are some examples of transparent materials.Why did Ghulan, Sheeta and Sara choose these places to hide?\nDo you think it would be possible for Sheeta’s brother to \nsee her and her friends through a closed wooden window of the house?Object Hard/Soft Material(s)\nBrick Hard Baked clay\nWater bottle\nPillowTumblerTableSweaterAny otherTable 6.3: Hard or soft objects and the materials \nthey are made up of\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nChapter 6.indd   108 10/4/2024   3:15:25 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n109There are many materials through which you are not \nable to see at all.

The water levels differ in each case, which \nindicates that the amount of water in each tumbler is different. \nThe water in the first tumbler occupies less space, \nindicating that the volume of water in this tumbler is less than the water in the other tumbler. The space occupied by water represents its volume.\nYou may have noticed drinking water bottles of different \nsizes being sold in the market.

Can we give a general name to anything that possesses these two properties? \nAnything that occupies space and has \nmass is called matter. The mass gives the quantity of matter, and the units to measure it are gram\n (g) and kilogram (kg). \nThe \nspace occupied by matter is its volume. The units to \nmeasure the volume are litre (L) and millilitre (mL).\nKilogram is the unit of mass in the International System \nof Units (SI). Kilogram is abbreviated in lower case as kg. There is no space between ‘k’ and ‘g’ in kg, and no full stop after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the mass, always leave a space between the number (numerical value) and the unit. For example, if we have mass of 7 kilograms, it would be written as 7 kg and not as 7 kgs.\nSimilarly, litre is abbreviated as capital L and \nmillilitre as mL. There is no space between ‘m’ and ‘L’ \nin mL. For example, if you have 500 millilitres of water, it would be written as 500 mL, m will be in lower case and L will be in upper case. The SI unit for volume is cubic metre, abbreviated as m\n3. The \nabbreviation is written with a superscript 3 to denote cubic metre. For example, if you have volume of 2 cubic metres, it would be written as 2 m\n3. Always leave a space between number \n(numerical value) and the unit. 1 m3 =1000  L.Do you \nknow?\nMaterials Around Us\nChapter 6.indd   115 10/4/2024   3:16:21 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n116Can all the materials around us be \nconsidered as different examples of \nmatter?

One day they came home from school. Their parents were away at work and Lambok complained that he was feeling feverish. Phiban touched his forehead and felt that he might be having a fever.

She washed the thermometer tip again, dried \nWrong measurements are worse than \nno measurements at all. \n— Anna Mani\n7.1 Hot or Cold?\nWe know from experience that some bodies are hotter than others. For example, during summers, the tap water may be hotter than the cold water from a matka (earthen pot) or a it and put it back. She then asked Lambok to change his school uniform, eat his lunch, and rest for some time. \nCan it always be \ncorrectly judged, that a person has fever, only by touching the person??\nChapter 7.indd   123 10/4/2024   3:14:46 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science| Grade 6\n124refrigerator. We can realise this by merely touching the two \nsamples of water. But can we always rely upon our sense of touch? Let us find out.\nActivity 7.1: Let us investigate\n Take three large containers and label them A, B and C, as shown in Fig. 7.1.\n Pour warm water in container A, tap water in B and ice-cold water in C. \n We will conduct this activity in two parts — prediction and observation.\n Firstly, predict what will you feel if you \n —dip your right hand in A and left hand in C and keep them there for 1–2 minutes.\n —take out your hands from containers A and C, and place both hands simultaneously in B.Compare whether your observations match with your predictions. Did your right hand feel that the water in container B is cool, while your left hand felt that the same water is warm? What do you infer \nfrom these observations?\nWe cannot always rely upon our sense of \ntouch to decide correctly whether a body is hot or cold. \n7.2 Temperature\nA reliable measure of hotness (or coldness) of a body is its temperature. A hotter body has a higher temperature \nthan a colder body.  The difference in temperature between the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison to another body.  A device that measures temperature is called a thermometer.\nThere are two kinds of thermometers that you are  \nlikely to come across—clinical thermometers and laboratory thermometers. Clinical thermometers are used to measure human body temperatures whereas laboratory thermometers are used for many other purposes. Let us now learn more about thermometers and how to use them to measure temperature. \n7.3  Measuring Temperature\n7.3.1 Clinical thermometer\nYou might be familiar with a thermometer, like that shown in Fig. 7.2, which is used for measuring our body temperature. It is called a clinical thermometer. Such thermometers show temperatures digitally. These are also known as digital clinical thermometers and run on batteries.

We can realise this by merely touching the two \nsamples of water. But can we always rely upon our sense of touch? Let us find out.\nActivity 7.1: Let us investigate\n Take three large containers and label them A, B and C, as shown in Fig. 7.1.\n Pour warm water in container A, tap water in B and ice-cold water in C. \n We will conduct this activity in two parts — prediction and observation.\n Firstly, predict what will you feel if you \n —dip your right hand in A and left hand in C and keep them there for 1–2 minutes.\n —take out your hands from containers A and C, and place both hands simultaneously in B.Compare whether your observations match with your \npredictions. Did your right hand feel that the water in container B is cool, while your left hand felt that the same water is warm? What do you infer \nfrom these observations?\nWe cannot always rely upon our sense of \ntouch to decide correctly whether a body is hot or cold. \n7.2 Temperature\nA reliable measure of hotness (or coldness) of a body is its temperature. A hotter body has a higher temperature \nthan a colder body.  The difference in temperature between the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison to another body.  A device that measures temperature is called a thermometer.\nThere are two kinds of thermometers that you are  \nlikely to come across—clinical thermometers and laboratory thermometers. Clinical thermometers are used to measure human body temperatures whereas laboratory thermometers are used for many other purposes. Let us now learn more about thermometers and how to use them to measure temperature. \n7.3  Measuring Temperature\n7.3.1  Clinical thermometer\nYou might be familiar with a thermometer, like that shown in Fig. 7.2, which is used for measuring our body temperature. It is called a clinical thermometer. Such thermometers show temperatures digitally. These are also known as digital clinical thermometers and run on batteries.

But mercury is an extremely toxic substance and is difficult to dispose of if the thermometer breaks accidently. \nDigital thermometers pose no such risk and also the \nnumbers in its display are easier to read. Therefore, mercury thermometers are being replaced by digital thermometers. Temperature in a digital thermometer is determined with the help of heat sensors. \ntemperature when the thermometer is placed in contact \nwith a person’s body.\nFor measuring temperature, the clinical thermometers \ngenerally use a scale called the Celsius scale. On this \nscale, the unit of temperature is degree Celsius and is \ndenoted by °C.  \nThey are non-contact thermometers, \nalso called infrared \nthermometers. Such thermometers can measure temperature without touching a person’s body and thus reduce the risk of spreading disease.\nDuring the COVID-19 \npandemic, some special \nthermometers were used, \nwhich could measure the \ntemperature of a person \nfrom a distance. What were \nthose?\nChapter 7.indd   126 10/4/2024   3:14:51 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTemperature and its Measurement\n127Activity 7.2: Let us measure\nLet us now use a digital clinical thermometer \nto measure body temperature. You may measure your own temperature as well as the temperature of some of your friends. Talk to your friends to find out who would be willing to get their body temperatures measured by you.\n Wash your hands and the tip of the digital thermometer with soap and water.\n Reset the thermometer by pressing the reset button. \n Place the thermometer under the tongue and close your mouth. \n Wait till the thermometer makes a beeping sound or flashes a light.\n Take it out from the mouth and read the temperature on the digital display. \n Record the temperature in Table 7.1.\n Clean the tip of the thermometer with soap and water, and dry it.\n Repeat the above steps for measuring the temperatures of your friends. \nTable 7.1: Body temperatures of 10 persons\nPrecautions   \nto be taken while  \nusing a digital clinical \nthermometer\n• To be used after reading the \ninstruction manual of the thermometer. \n•\n Tip of the thermometer to be washed with soap and water before and after use.\n•\n While washing, care to be\n \ntaken to keep the digital portion such as the display out of water.  \n•\n Do not hold the thermometer by the tip.  \nS. no.

But in this activity, did you find that the normal \ntemperature of every person was 37.0 °C? Or did you find the \ntemperature slightly higher or lower for some people?  \nThe temperature of every person may not \nbe 37.0 °C. What we call normal temperature \nis the average body temperature of a large \nnumber of healthy people. A perfectly \nhealthy person may, therefore, have a normal temperature slightly different from 37.0\n °C. The body temperature is influenced \nby several factors, such as age, time of the day and activity level.\nYou may try measuring your own \ntemperature at different times of the day and on different days. Record the thermometer readings in your notebook. After a month, analyse your temperature record and see if there are any variations. If yes, try to think what might be the reasons for that. \nThe temperature of human beings does \nnot normally go below 35 \n°C or above 42 °C. \nFor measuring the body temperature \nof small children or old people, the digital thermometer can also be placed in the armpit. The temperature measured this way is about 0.5 °C to 1 °C lower than the actual body temperature.\nThere is another scale of temperature \nknown as Fahrenheit scale. On this scale, the \nunit of temperature is degree Fahrenheit and \nis denoted by °F.  A temperature measured as 37.0\n °C on Celsius scale is \nequivalent to 98.6 °F \non Fahrenheit scale. The Fahrenheit scale is not used in most scientific studies anymore. In scientific work, there is another scale of temperature known as Kelvin scale. On this \nscale, the unit for temperature is kelvin and \nis denoted by K. The SI unit of temperature \nis kelvin.\nDo small children \ngenerally have slightly higher body temperatures as compared to adults??\nDo old people, even when healthy, generally have lower body temperatures than young adults??\nI have seen a friend of mine \nusing a digital thermometer \nthat reads temperature on \na different scale. It shows \nthe normal temperature of \na healthy human body as \n98.6 °F.  What is the reason \nfor this difference?\nChapter 7.indd   128 10/4/2024   3:14:52 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTemperature and its Measurement\n129\nThe names of temperature scales—Celsius scale, \nFahrenheit scale and Kelvin scale—start with a capital letter. For the units for temperature, degree Celsius and degree Fahrenheit, the word degree starts with a lower-case letter while Celsius and Fahrenheit start with a capital letter. The unit kelvin starts with a lower-case letter. The symbols of all units (°C, °F, K) are capital letters. Note that degree sign (°) is not written with K. A full stop is not written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the temperature, a space is left between the number and the unit. For temperatures more than one degree, use the plural of ‘degree’, that is, ‘degrees’, while writing the full form of the unit.\nWe can easily convert the temperature from Celsius scale to Kelvin scale by using:\nTemperature in Kelvin  \nscale = Temperature in  \nCelsius scale + 273.15\nMore to \nknow!All three temperature \nscales, Celsius, Fahrenheit \nand Kelvin are named in honour of the scientists who developed these scales.\nHow was fever detected before \nthermometers were developed? Fever affects the pulse rate of a person. This \nwas known even in olden days \nin India. However, apart from \nfever, some other situations \nalso affect the pulse rate. Hence, pulse rate alone is not a reliable indicator of fever.\nDo you \nknow?\nNo, the \ntemperatures of \nboiling water and \nice are outside the \nrange of a clinical \nthermometer. \nCan a clinical \nthermometer be used for measuring the temperature of boiling water? Or for measuring the temperature of ice? ?\nHow can we measure \ntemperatures beyond \nthe range of a clinical \nthermometer?\nChapter 7.indd   129 10/4/2024   3:14:56 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science| Grade 6\n130\nFig.7.3(a): \nA laboratory \nthermometerBulb7.3.2 Laboratory thermometer\nThere are many types of laboratory thermometers but the \none that might be available in your school laboratory may look like the one shown in Fig. 7.3a. It consists of a long, narrow, uniform glass tube which is sealed. At one end of the tube is a bulb which contains a liquid. Outside the bulb, in the tube, a narrow column of liquid can be seen. There is a Celsius scale marked along the tube. The liquid column rises or falls with change in temperature. The mark of the Celsius scale with which the top level of the liquid column coincides is the temperature reading.\nThe liquid used in the laboratory \nthermometer is generally alcohol (coloured red to make it easily seen) or mercury. \nDo you \nknow?\nActivity 7.3: Let us observe\nLet us try to find the temperature range of a given laboratory \nthermometer. \n Take a laboratory thermometer and observe it carefully. \n Note down the following:\n —What is the lowest temperature it can measure? \n —What is the highest temperature it can measure? \n —So, the range of this thermometer is \nNow look at the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3a carefully.

Can you now find the smallest value that this thermometer can read?\nFor the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3b, the \ntemperature\n difference indicated between 0 °C \nand \n10 °C or between 10  °C and 20 °C is \n10 °C. And the \nnumber of divisions between these marks are 10 divisions. So, one small division can read 10/10 = 1 °C.  \nThat is, the smallest value that this thermometer \ncan read is\n 1 °C.\nYour school laboratory may have thermometers \nfor which \nthe range and the value of the smallest \ndivision may be different. It is, therefore, always necessary to look carefully at the thermometer you are about to\n use.\nYou have learnt \nhow to find the temperature range \nof a given laboratory thermometer. You have also learnt how to find the smallest value that a given laboratory thermometer can read. We will now learn how to measure temperature using a laboratory thermometer.

Does this mean that ice and water are the same substance? \nYes, ice and water are the two forms of the same substance. These forms are also called states. These different states of water show many differences in their behaviour. Water flows but ice does not. Water splashes but ice does not.  \n8.1 Investigating Water’s Disappearing Act\nIt is a rainy morning. While going to school, Aavi and Thirav observe that there are a lot of water puddles in the playground. That evening, when they go to play, they are surprised to observe that some of the water in the puddles \nhad disappeared. \nHave you ever noticed water \nin the puddles disappearing? \nWhere does it go? Discuss with your friends. \nWhere else have you seen \nwater disappearing? Can you \nthink of a possible reason why this   \n          happens? \nYou migh\nt have observed that after washing the \nutensils, water left on the surface of the utensils, dries up after some time. Does the reason you thought earlier \nto explain water disappearance apply in this case also? \nAavi wonders if water has seeped through the surface of \nthe utensils.\nThirav thinks that water does not seep through the \nsurface of the utensils. Design an activity to investigate whose idea is correct. \nActivity 8.2: Let us investigate \n Take a tablespoon of water on a steel plate as shown in Fig. 8.1. Observe whether water seeps through to \nthe other side of the plate or not.\n Keep observing this at regular intervals until the water completely disappears.\nWhat do you infer? Is this activity enough to come to the conclusion that water does not seep through a steel plate? \nIf water does not seep through the steel \nplate. Then, where has the water gone? \nThis water gets converted into gaseous \nstate called water vapour. The water vapour is another state of water. Let us think of another observation where you notice the water disappearing.\nWhile making dosa, we sprinkle some water \non the hot pan and it disappears. Where does it go?  \nFig. 8.1: Steel plate with  \na tablespoon of water\nThe water which is sprinkled on the hot \npan gets converted into steam. Steam is \nactually water vapour, some part of which converts into water droplets. \nThe process of conversion of water into \nits vapour state is called evaporation. \nThe process of evaporation takes place continuously, \neven at room temperature. Can you think of other examples of evaporation? \nDrying of wet clothes, mopped floor, and sweat on our \nbody are some examples of it.\nNow what do you think is the reason for the disappearance \nof water from the puddles? Is it due to: (i) seeping of water into the ground or (ii) evaporation of water or (iii) both of these?\nHand sanitiser disappears as you rub it on your hands. \nWhat happens to it? \nWater vapour is \nactually invisible \nbut the \npresence of \ntiny droplets \nof water in the steam makes it visible.\nDo you \nknow?Let us draw\nDraw a detailed sketch (with labels and caption) about what happens to the water.\nChapter 8.indd   145 10/4/2024   3:11:29 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n1468.2 Another Mystery \nNext day, Aavi, Thirav and their friends decide to make \nlemonade.

You can also try the above process with a metal container. You may be curious about where the water droplets come from. \nSuggest possible reasons explaining the appearance of \nwater droplets on the outer surface of the glass tumbler.

Water vapour from the air comes in contact with the cold surface of the glass tumbler and gets converted into water droplets on the glass tumbler through condensation. There is an increase in the reading on the digital weighing balance. Can we conclude that water is not seeping through the wall of the tumbler? Can we also conclude that the water collected outside the tumbler is only due to condensation? No, we cannot say that conclusively from Activity 8.4. What more can you do to show that water is not seeping from the glass tumbler? How would you modify Activity 8.4 to find the answer?Repeat Activity 8.4 with the following modifications— \n Mark the water level on the glass tumbler with a permanent marker or a visible tape. \nWhat do you observe? Water level in the glass tumbler \ndoes not go down but the extra water gets collected on the \nouter surface of the glass tumbler.

This activity shows that water is not seeping from \nthe glass tumbler and the extra water is getting collected because of condensation.  \n8.3 What are the Different States of Water?\nWater is a substance that can be observed in three different states in our daily life. In the solid state, it exists as ice. On heating, the ice melts and gets converted into its liquid state. On further heating, water gets converted into its gaseous state. Let us perform Activity 8.5 to identify the properties of different states of water.\nActivity 8.5: Let us identify \n Put an ice cube in one container and transfer it to another container of different shape. What changes do you notice in the shape of the ice cube? Record your observations in Table 8.3. \n Pour water from one container to another container of a different shape. Observe how water behaves compared to the ice cube and make a record. Did you notice how water flows from one container to the other? What happens to its shape? \n Pour water on a clean surface and observe how it spreads. \n When water gets converted into water vapour, how does this water vapour spread? Compare this with the spreading behaviour of water. What are the differences in the properties of water in \nsolid, liquid and gaseous states?\nIce (solid state) retains its shape irrespective of the \ncontainer in which it is placed while water takes the shape \nof the container. Ice does not flow or spread.  \nWater (liquid state) flows and changes its shape. Water \ndoes not have a fixed shape. It takes up the shape of the container in which it is kept, but the volume of water remains constant. Does water also possess the property to spread? Yes, water also has the property to spread while keeping the volume constant. \nWater vapour (gaseous state) exhibits a property of \nspreading out in the entire available space. Gases do not possess a fixed shape. Water vapour exists even at room temperature; though it is invisible to us. It is present in the air around us. The water that evaporates during processes like drying of clothes or mopping of floors contribute to the water vapour in the air around us. \nYou are now familiar with the three states of water. Some \nother substances also exhibit these states. For example, wax, oil and ghee. Let us look at some more examples of solids, liquids and gases.\nLook around and find some examples of solid substances. \nSome examples could be stones, wood and glass.\nWhat are the other examples of liquids you can think of? \nHere are two examples— milk and oil. Think of five more \nexamples.\nHave you ever noticed that you can smell the food being \ncooked even without entering the kitchen? How does this smell reach us? \nIt is because the smell of yummy food from cooking \nspreads through the air and reaches our nostrils, even if we are not in the kitchen.\nWhat are the other examples of gases you can think of? \nWhat about oxygen and carbon dioxide? \n8.4 How can W e change the States of Water? \nSo far we have learnt that water can exist in solid, liquid and gaseous states.

If we want to change \nwater into ice, what should be \ndone?\nIt can be done by placing \nwater in a cold environment, \nsuch as a freezer. Water freezes and is \nconverted into ice. If we take the ice out of the freezer, \nit melts and is converted into water. \nCan you think of any other example, besides water, that \ncan change from solid to liquid? \nA candle, which is made of wax, is one such example. \nHow can we turn candle wax into liquid state? How can \nwe change the liquid wax back into solid state? We should cool the liquid wax to change it into a solid. What are the other liquids you have seen which get converted into a solid? Have you ever seen coconut oil getting converted into its solid state during the winter\n season? \nHence, we can see that water and other substances change \ntheir states on heating or cooling.

Aavi expresses surprise and asks, “Why is the water in the earthen pot so cold? I never observed water getting cold in a stainless steel pot.” What do you think is the reason?\n Water seeps through the surface of the \nearthen pot and \nevaporates, which imparts \na cooling effect on the water. What are the \nother examples of cooling effect? Sprinkling \nwater on the floor or the roof during summer \nto cool it, is another example.\nHow do you feel when you rub sanitiser on  \nyour hands?\nLet us perform Activity 8.9 to observe the cooling effect \nby making a simple and electricity-free model of pot-in-pot cooler. \nActivity 8.9: Let us make a model  \n Take two earthen pots of different sizes. \n Fill the bottom of the larger pot with a layer of sand.\n Place the smaller pot into the centre of the larger one as shown in Fig. 8.7.\n Fill the gap between the pots with more sand.\n Pour water in the sand area. Place a lid or wet jute \nsack to cover the top of the smaller pot.\n You can also make a drawing of the pot-in-pot cooler once it is ready.\nAllow 4–5 hours for the mini pot-in-pot cooler to cool \ndown. The time range can be influenced by many conditions. Observe and discuss how it creates a cooling effect inside the pots. Keep some vegetables and fruits in it and observe for a week on a daily basis to check for the freshness of the vegetables and fruits kept inside the cooler. You will have to add water regularly to keep the sand moist. For how many days can the vegetables and fruits be kept fresh in it? What are the conditions which can affect the number of these days? What else can be used in place of sand for better cooling? \nYou all may be familiar with this unique clay pot \nwhich is called Surahi (Fig. 8.8). In summers, surahi is \nused to keep the water cold.\n8.7 How Do clouds G ive us Rain?  \nCondensation plays a significant role in the process of bringing evaporated water back to the Earth’s surface. How does this happen? When air moves higher above the Earth’s surface, it becomes cooler and cooler. At certain heights, the air gets so cool that the water vapour in it turns into droplets which are generally formed around dust particles. These small droplets float in the air and form clouds. Many droplets join together to form bigger drops of water. Some drops get so heavy that they start falling. These falling water drops are what we call rain. Now, \nI can understand \nwhy we feel cooler if we sit \nunder a fan! The wind helps \nthe sweat to evaporate \nand cools us.\nThe amount of water \nvapour in the air is more on rainy days and hence rainy days are more humid.\n Do you \nknow? It is also a common observation \nthat clothes dry slowly on a rainy day. On a rainy day, water evaporates slowly. If the amount of water in the air is already high (more humidity), water evaporates slowly.\nIf you want to dry your clothes on a rainy day, how can you make it faster? \nChapter 8.indd   156 10/4/2024   3:12:16 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Journey through States of Water\n1578.6 cooling Effect \nAavi’s mother purchased a new matka (earthen pot) to \nreplace the stainless steel pot for storing drinking water. \nUpon returning from school, Aavi notices the earthen pot and drinks water from it.

Sprinkling \nwater on the floor or the roof during summer \nto cool it, is another example.\nHow do you feel when you rub sanitiser on  \nyour hands?\nLet us perform Activity 8.9 to observe the cooling effect \nby making a simple and electricity-free model of pot-in-pot cooler. \nActivity 8.9: Let us make a model  \n Take two earthen pots of different sizes. \n Fill the bottom of the larger pot with a layer of sand.\n Place the smaller pot into the centre of the larger one as shown in Fig. 8.7.\n Fill the gap between the pots with more sand.\n Pour water in the sand area. Place a lid or wet jute \nsack to cover the top of the smaller pot.\n You can also make a drawing of the pot-in-pot cooler once it is ready.\nAllow 4–5 hours for the mini pot-in-pot cooler to cool \ndown. The time range can be influenced by many conditions. Observe and discuss how it creates a cooling effect inside the pots. Keep some vegetables and fruits in it and observe for a week on a daily basis to check for the freshness of the vegetables and fruits kept inside the cooler. You will have to add water regularly to keep the sand moist. For how many days can the vegetables and fruits be kept fresh in it? What are the conditions which can affect the number of these days? What else can be used in place of sand for better cooling? \nYou all may be familiar with this unique clay pot \nwhich is called Surahi (Fig. 8.8). In summers, surahi is \nused to keep the water cold.\n8.7 How Do clouds Give us Rain?  \nCondensation plays a significant role in the process of bringing evaporated water back to the Earth’s surface. How does this happen? When air moves higher above the Earth’s surface, it becomes cooler and cooler. At certain heights, the air gets so cool that the water vapour in it turns into droplets which are generally formed around dust particles. These small droplets float in the air and form clouds. Many droplets join together to form bigger drops of water. Some drops get so heavy that they start falling. These falling water drops are what we call rain. \nFig. 8.8: A surahi\nWhy does air containing \nwater vapour go up in the atmosphere (thin layer of air that surrounds the Earth)? \nAs we know, gas balloons \ncontaining lighter gases go up in the air. Similarly, water vapour is lighter than air, causing it to rise.  \n Do you \nknow?\nLarge potSmall pot\nLidLayer of sandWet jute \nsack\n Fig. 8.7: A pot-in-pot cooler\nChapter 8.indd   157 10/4/2024   3:12:23 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n158Under special conditions, it  might also fall as hail or snow. \nAavi enjoys the rain and creates a poem.

This circulation of water is known as the  \nwater cycle. \nOnly a small portion of water available on the Earth is \nfit for use by plants, animals and humans. Most of the water is in the oceans and it cannot be used directly. We use water for drinking and also for many other activities. The number of people using water is increasing with a rise in population. The increasing demand for water causes its shortage in many parts of the world. Hence, it is very important to use water wisely and avoid wasting it. Let us keep our water bodies free from pollution. You will learn more about water and its conservation in the chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’. \nWhat did I do well? \nWas I able to label all the parts of the water cycle?

Their parents have planned a trip to visit their relatives and friends living across India. They always stay in touch with their relatives and friends. Do you also keep in touch with your loved ones?\nTheir first halt is at their Nani’s (maternal grandmother’s) \nhouse in Haryana. It is surrounded by large fields. Malli and Valli are fascinated by the variety of grains piled up in the courtyard. Their Mami (maternal aunt) and Mama (maternal uncle), along with other community members, are busy separating small stones and husk from the grains with their hands. Methods of Separation  \nin Everyday Life9Chapter\nसाधु ऐसा चाहिए जैसा स ूप सुभाय ।  \nसार सार को गहि र िै थोथा दई उड ाय ।।\n —कबीर\n Just like winnowing makes the husk blow away \nwhile retaining the grains, similarly, sages let \nthe virtues stay while discarding the vices.\n—Kabir\nMalli and Valli are curious to know why this is being \ndone. Their Nani notices their curiosity and explains,  “We are \nremoving these stones so that the grains are fit for cooking.”\nChapter 9.indd   163 10/4/2024   3:10:10 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFig. 9.1: Handpicking   \nFig. 9.2: Threshing   \nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n164They go around the house to see the fields and the \ncattle. To keep them busy, Nani gives them a challenge of \nhandpicking small stones from grains while keeping their eyes closed.\nThe method of picking by hand from a mixture (when \ntwo or more substances are mixed) such as small stones and husk from wheat and rice is called handpicking. It is done \non the basis of differences in size, colour and \nshape of the particles. If the particles to be \nremoved are present in small quantities and \ncan easily be picked by hand, handpicking proves to be a convenient method. \n  \nAt lunch, Malli and Valli are served \nsteaming hot vegetable pulao. While \neating the pulao, Nani observes that \nMalli is separating whole black peppers \nfrom the pulao and is placing them  \naside on his plate (Fig.  9.1). Valli playfully teases, \n“W\now! This is a handpicking method, nice one!” \nNani tells them about the benefits of black pepper and encourages Malli to eat it. \nLater in the day, their Mama takes them to the fields \nwhere they observe bundles of harvested \nwheat stalks lying in the fields. Some \nstalks are spread in the sun for drying. Both of them pick up a stalk each and \nnotice numerous grains attached to it. A \ngroup of farmers are beating the stalks \non a large wooden log. Curiously, Valli \nasks Mama, “Why are they doing this?” \nMama explains, “They are beating \nthe stalks to separate the grains” (Fig. \n9.2). This process of separating grains \nfrom the stalks is known as \nthreshing. Farmers work hard, \nyet they enjoy their work. From time to time, they sing folk songs while working. \nExplore folk songs of your region and try to \nsing along with your friends.Have fun \nwhile \nyou learn\nChapter 9.indd   164 10/4/2024   3:10:39 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFig. 9.3: Bamboo tray\nMethods of Separation  \nin Everyday Life\n165The separated grains get mixed with \npiles of husk.\nValli whispers to Malli, “Will the farmers \nhandpick the grains to remove them from \nso much husk?” She wonders, “How much time will the farmers take to separate these?”\nLet us perform an activity to find out \nthe answer to the questions raised by Valli.\nActivity 9.1: Let us explore \n Take a handful of roasted peanuts and rub them between your palms. What happens? \n Is it possible to separate the removed skin and the peanuts?\n Now, try blowing it. What do you observe?\nWhich of these components—removed peanut skins or peanuts are blown away?\nYou observe that blowing air separates the heavier and \nthe lighter components.\nHow do you think farmers separate so many grains \nfrom\n husk? \nTraditionally, a \nsoop (bamboo tray) is used for separating \nheavier and lighter components of a mixture (Fig. 9.3). \nNext day, their Nana takes \nthem to the fields to show this process at work.\nMalli and Valli observe a \nfarmer standing on a raised platform. The farmer is moving the bamboo tray which contains threshed wheat grains in the direction of air or wind (Fig.\n 9.4).\nWhat do you \ninfer from Fig.  9.4? Do both  the components, \nwheat grains and husk, \nfall at the same place? Which of the \ntwo components get blown away?

You know if we do not \nhave a strainer, we can still remove most of the tea leaves. \nValli: How? Dada: Leave the sauce pan (vessel) containing tea \nundisturbed for some time and gently pour the tea in a cup (Fig.\n 9.9).\nValli: Oh Yes! And then the tea leaves will be settled at the \nbottom.\nThe \nprocess of settling down of heavier insoluble \ncomponent at the bottom of a liquid is called sedimentation. \nWhen the water (liquid) is removed by tilting the vessel, the process is called decantation.\nIn the chapter ‘Materials Around Us’, you have studied \nthat oil does not mix with water and forms a separate layer when left undisturbed for some time. Which method of separation would you use to separate oil and water??Fig. 9.9: Decantation\nTea \nleaves\nDada: But I can still get a few tea leaves in my mouth \nbecause decantation does not completely separate all the \ntea leaves from the tea.\nBalan: Oh! It means it is not a proper method of separation.Dada: Yes, you are right. The tea is ready now. \nMalli picks up the tea-strainer from the shelf and gives it \nto his Dada.\nDada: Let me pour the tea through this strainer. You can \nsee all the tea leaves collected in the strainer. \nThis process of separating tea leaves from tea is called \nfiltration.\nBalan asks Malli if he could use a tea strainer to filter \nmuddy water. Let us try and find out.\nDada: Also, try to filter the muddy water through a piece \nof cloth and observe the difference.Oh! \nDecantation \nis also used in \nwashing and \ncleaning of rice \nand pulses.\nChapter 9.indd   170 10/7/2024   9:55:55 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMethods of Separation  \nin Everyday Life171Malli: Why should we use a piece of cloth?\nDada: In a piece of cloth, there are very small holes \nor pores  between the woven threads. These pores in the cloth can be used as a filter. People in ancient times also followed this practice.\nBut if the water is still muddy, impurities can be \nseparated using a filter with even smaller holes or pores. A filter paper is one such filter that has very fine pores in it.\nActivity 9.4: Let us experiment\n Try to fold the filter paper yourself and make a cone as shown in Fig. 9.10.\nFig. 9.10: Folding a filter paper to form a cone A filter paper One-fold Two-folds Cone\n Place it inside a funnel kept on a conical flask and pour muddy water into it (Fig. 9.11).\n What do you observe?

Otukkam is a fisherman. As they cast the fishing net, water drains out through the mesh. Valli recalls the filtration method she had learnt and realises that this method of catching the fish is somewhat similar. \nMalli is taken aback when he sees plastic bags, broken bottles, a large fish with a straw stuck in its mouth, and food wrappers along with the other fish trapped in the\n net.\nOther than the filter paper, many materials such as \ncotton, charcoal, and sand can be used as filters. The choice of filter depends upon the size of the particles of the materials to be removed.\nMore to \nknow!\nTea bags were initially made of soft cloth, like silk, because it could hold the tea leaves and let water pass through. Silk was strong and did not \nfall apart when it touched hot water. Later, people \nstarted using gauze or muslin. Eventually they began using filter paper, which is what most tea bags are made of today.\n Do you \nknow?Activity 9.5: Let us design and create\nValli goes for a nature walk with her Dadi and collects \nsome water from a pond in a container.

It can be used to separate a solid dissolved in a liquid.\n  The process of settling down of heavier insoluble component at the bottom of a liquid is called sedimentation. When the liquid is removed by tilting the vessel, the process is called decantation.\n  Filtration can be used to separate insoluble solid components from a liquid.\n  Churning is used to extract butter from curd.\n  Separation of magnetic and non-magnetic substances by using a magnet is called magnetic separation.\nPlay a Game—WISE FISH\nPrepare your own fishing rod with locally available eco-friendly \nmaterials.

{"class": "7", "subject": "math", "chapter": "Chapter 10: algebraic expressions", "content": "MATHEMA TICS 160\nAlgebraic\nExpressions\n10.1  I NTRODUCTION\nWe have already come across simple algebraic expressions like x + 3,  y – 5, 4 x + 5,\n10y – 5 and so on. In Class VI, we have seen how these expressions are useful in formu-\nlating puzzles and problems. We have also seen examples of several expressions in the\nchapter on simple equations.\nExpressions are a central concept in algebra. This Chapter is devoted to algebraic\nexpressions. When you have studied this Chapter , you will know how algebraic\nexpressions are formed, how they can be combined, how we can find their values and\nhow they can be used .\n10.2  H OW ARE EXPRESSIONS  FORMED ?\nWe now know very well what a variable is. We use letters x, y, l, m, ... etc. to denote\nvariables. A variable  can take various values. Its value is not fixed. On the other hand, a\nconstant  has a fixed value. Examples of constants are: 4, 100, –17, etc.\nWe combine variables and constants to make algebraic expressions. For this, we use\nthe operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We have already come\nacross expressions like 4 x + 5, 10y  – 20. The expression 4x  + 5 is obtained from the\nvariable x, first by multiplying x by the constant 4 and then adding the constant 5 to the\nproduct. Similarly , 10y – 20 is obtained by first multiplying y by 10 and then subtracting 20\nfrom the product.\nThe above expressions were obtained by combining variables with constants. We can\nalso obtain expressions by combining variables with themselves or with other variables.\nLook at how the following expressions are obtained:\nx2, 2y2, 3x2 –5, xy, 4xy + 7\n(i)The expression x2 is obtained by multiplying the variable x by itself;\nx × x =x2\nJust as 4 × 4 is written as 42, we write x × x = x2. It is commonly read as x squared.\nChapter  10\n2024-25\n\nALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 161\n(Later , when you study the chapter ‘Exponents and Powers’  you will realise that x2\nmay also be read as x raised to the power 2).\nIn the same manner , we can write x × x × x = x3\nCommonly , x3 is read as ‘ x cubed’. Later , you will realise that x3 may also be read\nas x raised to the power 3.\nx, x2, x3, ... are all algebraic expressions obtained from x.\n(ii)The expression 2y2 is obtained from y:2y2 = 2 × y × y\nHere by multiplying y with y we obtain y2 and then we multiply y2 by the constant 2.\n(iii) In (3x2 – 5) we first obtain x2, and multiply it by 3 to get 3 x2.\nFrom 3 x2, we subtract 5 to finally arrive at 3 x2 – 5.\n(iv) In xy, we multiply the variable x with another variable y. Thus,\nx × y = xy.\n (v) In 4xy + 7, we first obtain xy, multiply it by 4 to get 4 xy and\nadd 7 to 4\nxy to get the expression.\n10.3  T ERMS OF AN EXPRESSION\nWe shall now put in a systematic form what we have learnt above about how expressions\nare formed. For this purpose, we need to understand what terms  of an expression and\ntheir factors  are.\nConsider the expression (4x  + 5). In forming this expression, we first formed 4x\nseparately as a product of 4 and x and then added 5 to it. Similarly consider the expression\n(3x2 + 7y). Here we first formed 3 x2 separately as a product of 3, x and x . We then\nformed 7 y separately as a product of 7 and y. Having formed 3 x2 and 7 y separately , we\nadded them to get the expression.\nYou will find that the expressions we deal with can always be seen this way . They\nhave parts which are formed separately and then added. Such parts of an expression\nwhich are formed separately first and then added are known as terms . Look at the\nexpression (4 x2 – 3xy). We say that it has two terms, 4 x2 and –3 xy. The term 4 x2 is a\nproduct of 4, x and x, and the term (–3 xy) is a product of (–3), x and y.\nTerms ar e added to form expressions. Just as the terms 4x  and 5 are added to\nform the expression (4 x + 5), the terms 4 x2 and (–3 xy) are added to give the expression\n(4x2 – 3xy). This is because 4 x2 + (–3 xy) = 4x2 – 3xy.\nNote, the minus sign (–)  is included in the term. In the expression 4x2 –3xy, we\ntook the term as (–3 xy) and not as (3 xy). That is why we do not need to say that\nterms are ‘added or subtracted’ to form an expression; just ‘added’ is enough.\nFactors of a term\nWe saw above that the expression (4x2 – 3xy) consists of two terms 4 x2 and –3xy . The\nterm 4 x2 is a product of 4, x and x; we say that 4, x and x are the factors of the term 4 x2.\nA term is a product of its factors. The term –3 xy is a product of the factors –3, x and y.Describe how the\nfollowing expressions\nare obtained:\n7xy + 5, x2y, 4x2 – 5\nxTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 162\nWe can represent the terms and factors of\nthe terms of an expression conveniently and\nelegantly by a tree diagram. The tree for the\nexpression (4 x2 – 3xy) is as shown in the\nadjacent figure.\nNote, in the tree diagram, we have used\ndotted lines for factors and continuous lines for\nterms. This is to avoid mixing them.\nLet us draw a tree diagram for the expression\n5xy + 10.\nThe factors are such that they cannot be\nfurther factorised. Thus we do not write 5 xy as\n5 × xy, because xy can be further factorised.\nSimilarly , if x3 were a term, it would be written as\nx × x × x and not x2 × x. Also, remember that\n1 is not taken as a separate factor .\nCoefficients\nWe have learnt how to write a term as a product of factors.\nOne of these factors may be numerical and the others algebraic\n(i.e., they contain variables). The numerical factor is said to be\nthe numerical coefficient or simply the coefficient of the term.\nIt is also said to be the coefficient of the rest of the term (which\nis obviously the product of algebraic factors of  the term). Thus\nin 5xy, 5 is the coef ficient  of the term . It is also the coef ficient\nof xy. In the term 10 xyz, 10 is the coef ficient of xyz, in the term\n–7x2y2, –7 is the coefficient of x2y2.\nWhen the coefficient of a term is +1, it is usually omitted.\nFor example, 1 x is written as x; 1 x2y2 is written as x2y2 and\nso on. Also, the coef ficient (–1) is indicated only by the minus sign. Thus (–1) x is\nwritten as –  x; (–1) x2 y2 is written as –  x2 y2 and so on.\nSometimes, the word ‘coef ficient’  is used in a more general way . Thus\nwe say that in the term 5 xy, 5 is the coef ficient of xy, x is the coef ficient of 5 y\nand y is the coefficient of 5 x. In 1\n0xy2, 10 is the coefficient of xy2, x is the\ncoefficient of 1 0y2 and y2 is the coefficient of 10 x. Thus, in this more general\nway, a coef ficient may be either a numerical factor or an algebraic factor or\na product of two or more factors. It is said to be the coefficient of the\nproduct of the remaining factors.\nEXAMPLE  1Identify , in the following expressions, terms which are\nnot constants.

When terms have different\nalgebraic factors, they are unlike  terms. For example, in the expression 2 xy – 3x + 5xy – 4,\nlook at the terms 2 xy and 5 xy. The factors of 2 xy are 2, x and y. The factors of 5 xy are 5,\nx and y. Thus their algebraic (i.e., those which contain variables) factors are the same and\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 164\nhence they are like terms. On the other hand the\nterms 2 xy and –3 x, have different algebraic factors.\nThey are unlike terms. Similarly , the terms, 2 xy\nand 4, are unlike terms. Also, the terms –3 x and 4\nare unlike terms.\n10.5 MONOMIALS , BINOMIALS , TRINOMIALS  AND\nPOLYNOMIALS\nAn expression with only one term is called a monomial ; for example, 7 xy, – 5m,\n3z2, 4 etc.\nAn expression which contains two unlike terms is called a\nbinomial ; for example, x + y, m – 5, mn + 4\nm, a2 – b2 are\nbinomials. The expression 10pq is not a binomial; it is a\nmonomial. The expression ( a + b + 5) is not a binomial.\nIt contains three terms.\nAn expression which contains three terms is called a\ntrinomial ; for example, the expressions x + y + 7, ab + a +b,\n3x2 – 5x  + 2, m + n + 10 are trinomials. The expression\nab + a + b + 5 is, however not a trinomial; it contains four\nterms and not three. The expression x +  y + 5x is not a trinomial\nas the terms x and 5 x are like terms.\nIn general, an expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Thus a\nmonomial, a binomial and a trinomial are all polynomials.\nEXAMPLE  3State with reasons, which of the following pairs of terms are of like\nterms and which are of unlike terms:\n(i)7x, 12y (ii)15x, –21 x (iii) – 4ab, 7ba (iv) 3xy, 3x\n(v)6xy2, 9x2y (vi) pq2, – 4pq2(vii) mn2, 10mn\nSOLUTION\nS.

There are a number of situations in which we need to find the value\nof an expression, such as when we wish to check whether a particular value of a variable\nsatisfies a given equation or not.\nWe find values of expressions, also, when we use formulas from geometry and from\neveryday mathematics. For example, the area of a square is l2, where l is the length of a\nside of the square. If l =  5 cm., the area is 52 cm2 or 25 cm2; if the side is 10 cm, the area\nis 102 cm2 or 100 cm2 and so on. We shall see more such examples in the next section.\n2024-25\n\nALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 167\nEXAMPLE  4Find the values of the following expressions for x = 2.\n(i)x + 4 (ii)4x – 3 (iii) 19 – 5 x2\n(iv) 100 – 10 x3\nSOLUTION Putting x = 2\n(i)In x + 4, we get the value of x + 4, i.e.,\nx + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6\n(ii)In 4x – 3, we get\n4x – 3 =  (4 × 2) – 3 = 8 – 3 = 5\n(iii) In 19 – 5 x2, we get\n19 – 5 x2 = 19 – (5 × 22) = 19 – (5 × 4) = 19 – 20 = – 1\n(iv) In 100 – 10\nx3, we get\n100 – 10 x3 = 100 – (10 × 23) = 100 – (10 × 8) (Note 23 = 8)\n= 100 – 80 = 20\nEXAMPLE  5Find the value of the following expressions when n =  – 2.\n(i)5n – 2 (ii)5n2 + 5n – 2 (iii) n3 + 5n2 + 5n – 2\nSOLUTION\n(i)Putting the value of n = – 2, in 5 n – 2, we get,\n5(– 2) – 2 = – 10 – 2 = – 12\n(ii)In 5n2 + 5n – 2, we have,\nfor n = –2, 5 n – 2 = –12\nand 5 n2 = 5 × (– 2)2 = 5 × 4 = 20 [as (– 2)2 = 4]\nCombining,\n5n2 + 5n – 2 = 20 – 12 = 8\n(iii) Now , for n = – 2,\n5n2 + 5n – 2 = 8 and\nn3 = (–2)3 = (–2) × (–2) × (–2) = – 8\nCombining,\nn3 + 5n2 + 5n – 2 = – 8 + 8 = 0\nWe shall now consider expressions of two variables, for example, x + y, xy. To work\nout the numerical value of an expression of two variables, we need to give the values of\nboth variables. For example, the value of ( x + y), for x = 3 and y = 5, is 3 + 5 = 8.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 168\nEXAMPLE  6Find the value of the following expressions for a = 3, b = 2.\n(i)a + b (ii)7a – 4b (iii) a2 + 2ab\n + b2\n(iv) a3 – b3\nSOLUTION Substituting a = 3 and b = 2 in\n(i)a + b, we get\na + b = 3 + 2 = 5\n(ii)7a – 4 b, we get\n7a – 4b = 7 × 3 – 4 × 2 = 21 – 8 = 13.\n(iii) a2 + 2ab + b2,  we get\na2 + 2ab + b2 = 32 + 2 × 3 × 2 + 22 = 9 + 2 × 6 + 4 = 9 + 12 + 4 = 25\n(iv) a3 – b3, we get\na3 – b3 = 33 – 23 = 3 × 3 × 3 – 2 × 2 × 2 = 9 × 3 – 4 × 2 = 27 – 8 = 19\nEXERCISE  10.2\n1.If m = 2, find the value of:\n(i)m – 2 (ii)3m – 5 (iii) 9 – 5 m\n(iv) 3m2 – 2m – 7 (v)5\n24m\u0013\n2.If p = – 2, find the value of:\n(i)4p + 7 (ii)– 3p2 + 4p + 7 (iii) – 2p3 – 3p2 + 4p + 7\n3.Find the value of the following expressions, when x = –1:\n(i)2\nx – 7 (ii)– x + 2 (iii) x2 + 2x + 1\n(iv) 2x2 – x – 2\n4.If a = 2, b = – 2, find the value of:\n(i)a2 + b2(ii)a2 + ab + b2(iii) a2 – b2\n5.When a = 0, b = – 1, find the value of the given expressions:\n(i)2a + 2 b (ii)2a2 + b2 + 1 (iii) 2a2b + 2 ab2 + ab\n(iv) a2 + ab + 2\n6.Simplify the expressions and find the value if x is equal to 2\n(i) x + 7 + 4 ( x – 5) (ii)3 (x + 2) + 5x  – 7\n(iii) 6x + 5 ( x – 2) (iv) 4(2x – 1) + 3x  + 11\n7.Simplify these expressions and find their values if x = 3, a = – 1, b = – 2.\n(i)3x – 5 – x + 9 (ii)2 – 8 x + 4x  + 4\n2024-25\n\nALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 169\n(iii)  3a + 5 – 8 a + 1 (iv) 10 – 3 b  – 4 – 5b\n(v) 2a – 2b – 4 – 5 + a\n8.

Simplify the expression and find its value when a = 5 and b = – 3.\n2(a2 + ab) + 3 – ab\n WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED ?\n1.Algebraic expr essions  are formed from variables  and constants.  We use the\noperations of addition, subtraction, multiplication  and division  on the variables\nand constants to form expressions. For example, the expression 4 xy + 7 is formed\nfrom the variables x and y and constants 4 and 7. The constant 4 and the variables\nx and y are multiplied to give the product 4 xy and the constant 7 is added to this\nproduct to give the expression.\n2.Expressions are made up of terms . Terms are added  to make an expression. For\nexample, the addition of the terms 4 xy and 7 gives the expression 4 xy + 7.\n3.A term is a product of factors . The term 4 xy in the expression 4 xy + 7 is a product\nof factors x, y and 4. Factors containing variables are said to be algebraic factors .\n4.The coefficient  is the numerical factor in the term. Sometimes anyone factor in a\nterm is called the coefficient of the remaining part of the term.\n5.Any expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial . Specifically a one\nterm expression is called a monomial ; a two-term expression is called a binomial ;\nand a three-term expression is called a trinomial .\n6.Terms which have the same algebraic factors are like terms. Terms\nwhich have different algebraic factors are unlike  terms. Thus,\nterms 4 xy and –  3xy are like terms; but terms 4xy and –  3x are\nnot like terms.\n7.In situations such as solving an equation and using a formula, we\nhave to find the value of an expression . The value of the\nexpression depends on the value of the variable from which the\nexpression is formed. Thus, the value of 7 x – 3 for x = 5 is 32,\nsince 7(5) – 3 = 35 – 3 = 32.\n2024-25\n"}

It  is\n5,970,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg!\nCan you read this number?\nMass of Uranus is 86,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg.\nWhich has greater mass, Earth or Uranus?\nDistance between Sun and Saturn is 1,433,500,000,000 m and distance between Saturn\nand Uranus is 1,439,000,000,000 m. Can you read these numbers? Which distance is less?\nThese very lar ge numbers are dif ficult to read, understand and compare. To make\nthese numbers easy to read, understand and compare, we use exponents. In this Chapter ,\nwe shall learn about exponents and also learn how to use them.\n11.2  E XPONENTS\nWe can write lar ge numbers in a shorter form using exponents.\nObserve 10, 000 = 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 104\nThe short notation 104 stands for the product 10×10×10×10. Here ‘10’ is called the\nbase  and ‘4’ the exponent . The number 104 is read as 10 raised to the power of 4  or\nsimply as fourth power of  10. 104 is called the exponential form  of 10,000.\nWe can similarly express 1 ,000 as a power of 10. Note that\n1000 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 103\nHere again, 103 is the exponential form of 1,000.\nSimilarly ,1,00,000 = 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 105\n105 is the exponential form of 1,00,000\nIn both these examples, the base is 10; in case of 103, the exponent\nis 3 and in case of 105 the exponent is 5.\nExponents and\nPowers\nChapter  11\n2024-25\n\nEXPONENTS AND POWERS 171\nWe have used numbers like 10, 100, 1000 etc., while writing numbers in an expanded\nform. For example, 47561 = 4 × 10000 + 7 × 1000 + 5 × 100 + 6 × 10 + 1\nThis can be written as 4 × 104 + 7 ×103 + 5 × 102 + 6 × 10 + 1.\nTry writing these numbers in the same way 172, 5642, 6374.\nIn all the above given examples, we have seen numbers whose base is 10. However\nthe base can be any other number also. For example:\n81 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 can be written as 81 = 34, here 3 is the base and 4 is the exponent.\nSome powers have special names. For example,\n102, which is 10 raised to the power 2, also read as ‘10 squared’ and\n103, which is 10 raised to the power 3, also read as ‘10 cubed’.\nCan you tell what 53 (5 cubed) means?\n53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125\nSo, we can say 125 is the third power of 5.\nWhat is the exponent and the base in 53?\nSimilarly , 25  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 =  32, which is the fifth power of 2.\nIn 25, 2 is the base and 5 is the exponent.\nIn the same way , 243 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 35\n64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 26\n625 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 54\nFind five more such examples, where a number is expressed in exponential\nform. Also identify the base and the exponent in each case.\nYou can also extend this way of writing when the base is a negative integer .\nWhat does (–2)3 mean?\nIt is (–2)3 =(–2) ×  (–2) ×  (–2) = – 8\nIs (–2)4 =16? Check it.\nInstead of taking a fixed number let us take any integer a as the base, and write the\nnumbers as,\na × a\n =a2  (read as ‘ a squared’ or ‘ a raised to the power 2’)\na × a × a =a3  (read as ‘ a cubed’ or ‘ a raised to the power 3’)\na × a × a × a =a4 (read as a raised to the power 4 or the 4th power of a)\n..............................\na × a × a × a × a × a × a = a7  (read as a raised to the power 7 or the 7th power of a)\nand so on.\na × a × a × b × b  can be expressed as a3b2 (read as a cubed b squared)\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 172\na × a × b  × b × b × b can be expressed as a2b4 (read as a\nsquared into b raised to the power of 4).\nEXAMPLE  1 Express 256 as a power 2.\nSOLUTION We have 256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2.\nSo we can say  that 256  = 28\nEXAMPLE  2Which one is greater 23 or 32?\nSOLUTION We have, 23 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8    and\n32  = 3 × 3 = 9.\nSince 9 > 8, so, 32 is greater than 23\nEXAMPLE 3Which one is greater 82 or 28?\nSOLUTION 82 =8 × 8 = 64\n28  =2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2  =  256\nClearly , 28 >82\nEXAMPLE  4Expand a3 b2, a2 b3, b2 a3, b3 a2. Are they all same?\nSOLUTION a3 b2  =a3 × b2\n= (a × a × a) × (b × b\n)\n=a × a × a × b × b\na2 b3 =a2 × b3\n=a × a × b × b × b\nb2 a3 =b2 × a3\n=b × b × a × a × a\nb3 a2 =b3 × a2\n=b × b × b × a × aTRY THESE\nExpress:\n(i)729 as a power of 3\n(ii)128 as a power of 2\n(iii) 343 as a power of 7\n272\n236\n218\n39\n3Note that in the case of terms a3 b2 and a2 b3 the powers of a and b are different. Thus\na3 b2 and a2 b3 are different.\nOn the other hand, a3 b2 and b2 a3 are the same, since the powers of a and b in these\ntwo terms are the same. The order of factors does not matter .\nThus, a3 b2 = a3 × b2 = b2 × a3 = b2 a3. Similarly , a2 b3 and b3 a2 are the same.\nEXAMPLE  5Express the  following numbers as a product of powers of prime factors:\n(i)72 (ii)432 (iii) 1000 (iv) 16000\nSOLUTION\n   (i) 72 = 2 × 36 = 2 × 2 × 18\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 9\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 23 × 32\nThus, 72 = 23 × 32 (required prim e factor product form)\n2024-25\n\nEXPONENTS AND POWERS 173\n(ii)432 = 2 × 216 = 2 × 2 × 108 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 54\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 27 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 9\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3\n  or 432 = 24 × 33(required form )\n(iii) 1000 = 2 × 500 = 2 × 2 × 250 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 125\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 25 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5\n  or 1000 = 23 × 53\nAtul wants to solve this example in another way:\n1000 = 10 × 100 = 10 × 10 × 10\n= (2 × 5) × (2 × 5) × (2 × 5) (Since10 = 2 × 5)\n=2 × 5 × 2 × 5 × 2 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5\n  or 1000 =  23 × 53\nIs Atul’ s method correct?\n(iv) 16,000 =  16 × 1000  =  (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) ×1000 = 24 ×103 (as 16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2)\n=(2 × 2 × 2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5) = 24 × 23 × 53\n(Since  1000 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5)\n=(2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 ) × (5 × 5 × 5)\n  or, 16,000 = 27 × 53\nEXAMPLE  6Work out (1)5, (–1)3, (–1)4, (–10)3, (–5)4.\nSOLUTION\n(i)We have (1)5 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 = 1\nIn fact, you will realise that 1 raised to any power is 1.\n(ii)(–1)3 = (–1) × (–1) × (–1) = 1 × (–1) = –1\n(iii) (–1)4 = (–1) × (–1) × (–1) × (–1) = 1 ×1 = 1\nYou may check that (–1) raised to any odd power is (–1),\nand (–1) raised to any even  power is (+1).\n(iv) (–10)3 = (–10) × (–10) × (–10) = 100 × (–10) = – 1000\n(v)(–5)4 = (–5) × (–5) × (–5) × (–5) = 25 × 25 = 625\nEXERCISE  11.1\n1.Find the value of:\n(i) 26(ii)93(iii) 112(iv) 54\n2.Express the following in exponential form:\n(i)6 × 6 × 6 × 6 (ii)t × t (iii) b × b × b × b\n(iv) 5 × 5× 7 × 7 × 7 (v)2 × 2 × a × a (vi) a × a × a × c × c × c × c × dodd number(–1) = –1\neven number(–1) = + 1\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 174\n3.Express each of the f ollowing numbers using exponential notation:\n(i)512 (ii)343 (iii) 729 (iv) 3125\n4.Identify the greater number , wherever possible, in each of the following?\n(i)43 or 34(ii)53  or 35(iii) 28 or 82\n(iv) 1002 or 2100(v)210 or 102\n5.Express each of the following as product of powers of their prime factors:\n(i)648 (ii)405 (iii) 540 (iv) 3,600\n6.Simplif y:\n(i)2 × 103(ii)72 × 22(iii) 23 × 5 (iv) 3 × 44\n(v)0 × 102(vi) 52 × 33(vii) 24 × 32(viii) 32 × 104\n7.Simplif y:\n(i)(– 4)3(ii)(–3) × (–2)3(iii) (–3)2 × (–5)2\n(iv) (–2)3 × (–10)3\n8.Compare the following numbers:\n(i)2.7 × 1012 ; 1.5 × 108(ii)4 × 1014  ; 3 × 1017\n11.3  L AWS OF EXPONENTS\n11.3.1  Multiplying Powers with the Same Base\n(i)Let us calculate 22 × 23\n22 × 23 =(2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2)\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 25 = 22+3\nNote that the base in 22 and 23 is same and the sum of the exponents, i.e., 2 and 3 is 5\n(ii)(–3)4 × (–3)3 = [(–3) × (–3) × (–3)× (–3)]  × [(–3) × (–3) × (–3)]\n=(–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3)\n=(–3)7\n=(–3)4+3\nAgain, note that the base is same and the sum of exponents, i.e., 4 and 3, is 7\n(iii) a2 × a4 = (a × a) × (\na × a × a  × a)\n= a × a × a × a × a × a =  a6\n(Note: the base is the same and the sum of the exponents is 2 + 4 = 6)\nSimilarly , verif y:\n42 × 42 =42+2\n32 × 33 =32+3\n2024-25\n\nEXPONENTS AND POWERS 175\nCan you write the appropriate number in the box.\n(–11)2 × (–1 1)6 = (–11)\nb2 × b3 =b (Remember , base is same; b is any integer).\nc3 × c4 =c  (c is any integer)\nd10 ×  d20 = d\nFrom this we can generalise that for any non-zero integer a, where m\nand n are whole numbers,\nam × an =am + n\nCaution!\nConsider 23 × 32\nCan you add the exponents?

We said that lar ge numbers can be\nconveniently expressed using exponents. We have not as yet shown this. We shall do so now .\n1.Sun is located 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m from the centre of our Milky Way\nGalaxy .\n2.Number of stars in our Galaxy is 100,000,000,000.\n3.Mass of the Earth is 5,976,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg.\nThese numbers are not convenient to write and read. To make\nit convenient we use powers.\nObserve the following:\n      59 = 5.9 × 10 = 5.9 × 101\n    590 = 5.9 × 100 = 5.9 × 102\n  5900 = 5.9 × 1000 = 5.9 × 103\n59000 = 5.9 × 10000 = 5.9 × 104  and so on.TRY THESE\nExpand by expressing\npowers of 10 in the\nexponential form:\n(i)172\n(ii)5,643\n(iii)56,439\n(iv)1,76,428\n2024-25\n\nEXPONENTS AND POWERS 183\nWe have expressed all these numbers in the standard form . Any number can be\nexpressed as a decimal number between 1.0 and 10.0 including 1.0 multiplied by a power\nof 10. Such a form of a number is called its standard form . Thus,\n5,985 = 5.985 × 1,000 = 5.985 × 103  is the standard form of 5,985.\nNote, 5,985 can also be expressed as 59.85 × 100 or 59.85 × 102. But these are  not\nthe standard forms, of 5,985. Similarly , 5,985 = 0.5985 × 10,000 = 0.5985 × 104 is also\nnot the standard form of 5,985.\nWe are now ready to express the lar ge numbers we came across at the beginning of\nthe chapter in this form.\nThe, distance of Sun from the centre of our Galaxy  i.e.,\n300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m  can be written as\n3.0 × 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 3.0 ×\n 1020 m\nNow, can you express 40,000,000,000 in the similar way?\nCount the number of zeros in it. It is 10.\nSo, 40,000,000,000 = 4.0 × 1010\nMass of the Earth = 5,976,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg\n=5.976 × 1024 kg\nDo you agree with the fact, that the number when written in the standard form is much\neasier to read, understand and compare than when the number is written with 25 digits?\nNow ,\nMass of Uranus = 86,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg\n     = 8.68 × 1025 kg\nSimply by comparing the powers of 10 in the above two, you can tell that the mass of\nUranus is greater than that of the Earth.\nThe distance between Sun and Saturn is 1,433,500,000,000 m or 1.4335 × 1012 m.\nThe distance betwen Saturn and Uranus is 1,439,000,000,000 m  or 1.439 × 1012 m.  The\ndistance between Sun and Earth is 149, 600,000,000 m or 1.496 × 1011m.\nCan you tell which of the three distances is smallest?\nEXAMPLE  13Express the following numbers in the standard form:\n(i)5985.3 (ii)65,950\n(iii) 3,430,000 (iv) 70,040,000,000\nSOLUTION\n(i)5985.3 = 5.9853 × 1000 = 5.9853 × 103\n(ii)65,950 = 6.595 × 10,000 = 6.595 × 104\n(iii) 3,430,000 = 3.43 × 1,000,000 = 3.43 × 106\n(iv) 70,040,000,000 = 7.004 × 10,000,000,000 = 7.004 × 1010\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 184\nA point to remember is that one less than the digit count (number of digits) to the left\nof the decimal point in a given number is the exponent of 10 in the standard form. Thus, in\n70,040,000,000 there is no decimal point shown; we assume it to be at the (right) end.\nFrom there, the count of the places (digits) to the left is 1 1. The exponent of 10 in the\nstandard form is 1 1 – 1 = 10. In 5985.3 there are 4 digits to the left of the decimal point\nand hence the expon ent of 10 in the standard form is 4 – 1 = 3.\nEXERCISE  11.3\n1.Write the following numbers in the expanded forms:\n279404, 3006194, 2806196, 120719, 20068\n2.Find the number from each of the following expanded forms:\n(a)8 ×104 + 6 ×103 + 0×102 + 4×101 + 5×100\n(b)4 ×105 + 5×103 + 3×102 + 2×100\n(c)3 ×104 + 7×102 + 5×100\n(d)9 ×105 + 2×102 + 3×101\n3.Express the following numbers in standard form:\n(i)5,00,00,000 (ii)70,00,000     (iii) 3,18,65,00,000\n       (iv)   3,90,878 (v)39087.8     (vi) 3908.78\n4.Express the number appearing in the following statements in standard form.\n(a)The distance between Earth and Moon is 384,000,000 m.\n(b)Speed of light in vacuum is 300,000,000 m/s.\n(c)Diameter of the Earth is 1,27,56,000 m.\n(d)Diameter of the Sun is 1,400,000,000 m.\n(e)In a galaxy there are on an average 100,000,000,000 stars.\n(f)The universe is estimated to be about 12,000,000,000 years old.\n(g)The distance of the Sun from the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy is estimated to\nbe 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m.\n(h)60,230,000,000,000,000,000,000 molecules are contained in a drop of water\nweighing 1.8 gm.\n(i)The earth has 1,353,000,000 cubic km of sea water .\n(j)The population of India was about 1,027,000,000 in March, 2001.\n2024-25\n\nEXPONENTS AND POWERS 185\nWHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED ?\n1.Very lar ge numbers are dif ficult to read, understand, compare and operate upon.

Artists, professionals, designers of clothing or jewellery ,\ncar manufacturers, architects and many others make use of the idea of symmetry .  The\nbeehives, the flowers, the tree-leaves, religious symbols, rugs, and handkerchiefs —\neverywhere you find symmetrical designs.\nYou have already had a ‘feel’  of line symmetr y in your previous class.\nA figure has a line symmetry , if there is a line about which the figure may be folded so\nthat the two parts of the figure will coincide.\nYou might like to recall these ideas.  Here are some activities to help you.Nature\nArchitecture\n Engineering\nCreate some colourful\nInk-dot devilsMake some symmetrical\npaper-cut designs.Compose a picture-album\n showing symmetry .\nChapter  12Symmetr y\n2024-25\n\nSYMMETRY 187\nEnjoy identifying lines (also called axes) of symmetry in the designs you collect.\nLet us now strengthen our ideas on symmetry further .  Study the following figures in\nwhich the lines of symmetry are marked with dotted lines. [Fig 12.1 (i) to (iv)]\n12.2  L INES OF SYMMETRY  FOR REGULAR  POLYGONS\nYou know that a polygon is a closed figure made of several line segments.  The polygon\nmade up of the least number of line segments is the triangle. (Can there be a polygon that\nyou can draw with still fewer line segments? Think about it).\nA polygon is said to be regular if all its sides are of equal length and all its angles are of\nequal measure. Thus, an equilateral triangle is a regular polygon of three sides. Can you\nname the regular polygon of four sides?\nAn equilateral triangle is regular because each of its sides has same length and each of\nits angles measures 60° (Fig 12.2).\nA square is also regular because all its sides are of equal length and each of its angles\nis a right angle (i.e., 90°).  Its diagonals are seen to be perpendicular bisectors of one\nanother (Fig 12.3).Fig 12.1(i) (ii) (iii) (iv)\n60°60°\n60°a a\na\nFig 12.2\nFig 12.3\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 188\nIf a pentagon is regular , naturally , its sides should have equal length. You will, later on,\nlearn that the measure of each of its  angles is 108° (Fig 12.4).\nA regular hexagon has all its sides equal and each of its angles measures 120°. You will\nlearn more of these figures later (Fig 12.5).\nThe regular polygons are symmetrical figures and hence their lines of symmetry are\nquite interesting,\nEach regular polygon has as many lines of symmetry as it has sides [Fig 12.6 (i) - (iv)].\nWe say, they have multiple lines of symmetry .\nPerhaps, you might like to investigate this by paper folding. Go ahead!\nThe concept of line symmetry is closely related to mirror reflection.  A shape has line\nsymmetry when one half of it is the mirror image of the other half (Fig 12.7). A mirror line,\nthus, helps to visualise a line of symmetry (Fig 12.8).\nIs the dotted line a mirror line? No. Is the dotted line a mirror line? Yes.\nFig 12.8Fig 12.4\nFig 12.6\nFig 12.7Fig 12.5\n2024-25\n\nSYMMETRY 189\nWhile dealing with mirror reflection, care is needed to note down the left-right changes\nin the orientation, as seen in the figure here (Fig 12.9).\nThe shape is same, but the other way round!\nPlay this punching game!\nFold a sheet into two halves Punch a hole two holes about the\nsymmetric fold.\nFig 12.10\nThe fold is a line (or axis) of symmetry .

The hands of a clock rotate in only one direction,\nabout a fixed point, the centre of the clock-face.\nRotation, like movement of the hands of a clock, is called a clockwise\nrotation; otherwise it is said to be anticlockwise.(a) (b) (c)\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 192\nWhat can you say about the rotation of the blades of a ceiling fan?  Do they rotate\nclockwise or anticlockwise? Or do they rotate both ways?\nIf you spin the wheel of a bicycle, it rotates.  It can rotate in either way: both clockwise\nand anticlockwise. Give three examples each for (i) a clockwise rotation and (ii) anticlockwise\nrotation.\nWhen an object rotates, its shape and size do not change.  The rotation turns an object\nabout a fixed point.  This fixed point is the centre of rotation . What is the centre of\nrotation of the hands of a clock?  Think about it.\nThe angle of turning during rotation is called the angle of r otation . A full\nturn, you know , means a rotation of 360°.  What is the degree measure of the\nangle of rotation for (i) a half-turn? (ii) a quarter-turn?\nA half-turn means rotation by 180°; a quarter-turn is rotation by 90°.\nWhen it is 12 O’clock, the hands of a clock are together . By 3 \nO’clock, the\nminute hand would have made three complete turns; but the hour hand would\nhave made only a quarter-turn.  What can you say about their positions at 6\nO’clock?\nHave you ever made a paper windmill? The Paper windmill in the picture\nlooks symmetrical (Fig 12.1 1); but you do not find any line of symmetry . No\nfolding can help you to have coincident halves. However if you rotate it by 90°\nabout the fixed point, the windmill will look exactly the same. We say the windmill\nhas a rotational symmetr y.\nFig 12.12\nIn a full turn, there are precisely four positions (on rotation through the angles 90°,\n180°, 270° and 360°) when the windmill looks exactly the same. Because of this, we say\nit has a rotational symmetry of order 4.\nHere is one more example for rotational symmetry .\nConsider a square with P as one of its corners (Fig 12.13).\nLet us perform quarter-turns about the centre of the square marked .\nFig 12.13\nFig 12.1 1\nA\nBCD\nD\nABC\nC\nDAB\nB A\nC BD CA D\n90° 90° 90° 90°\nP\n90°\nPP\nP90°P\n90° 90°\n(i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v)\n2024-25\n\nSYMMETRY 193\nFig 12.13 (i) is the initial position. Rotation by 90° about the centre leads\nto Fig 12.13 (ii). Note the position of P  now . Rotate again through 90° and you get\nFig 12.13 (iii). In this way , when you complete four quarter -turns, the square reaches its\noriginal position. It now looks the same as Fig12.13 (i). This can be seen with the help of\nthe positions taken by P .\nThus a square has a rotational symmetry of order 4  about its centre. Observe that\nin this case,\n(i)The centre of rotation is the centre of the square.\n(ii)The angle of rotation is 90°.\n(iii) The direction of rotation is clockwise.\n(iv) The order of rotational symmetry is 4.\nTRY THESE\n120°\n120°120°R\nR RR\n(i) (ii) (iii) (iv)\nDO THIS\n1.(a)Can you now tell the order of the rotational symmetry for an equilateral triangle?

O' then falls\non O.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 194\nStick a pin into the shapes at the point O.\nNow turn the transparent shape in the clockwise direction.\nHow many times do the shapes coincide in one full round?\nWhat is the order of rotational symmetry?\nThe point where we have the pin is the centre of rotation.  It is the\nintersecting point of the diagonals in this case.\nEvery object has a rotational symmetry of order 1, as it occupies\nsame position after a rotation of 360° (i.e., one complete revolution).\nSuch cases have no interest for us.\nYou have around you many shapes, which possess rotational\nsymmetry  (Fig 12.17).\nFruit Road sign Wheel\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nFig 12.17\nFor example, when you slice certain fruits, the cross-sections are shapes with rotational\nsymmetry . This might surprise you when you notice them [Fig 12.17(i)].\nThen there are many road signs that exhibit rotational symmetry . Next time when you\nwalk along a busy road, try to identify such road signs and find about the order of rotational\nsymmetry [Fig 12.17(ii)].\nThink of some more examples for rotational symmetry .

By now you\nwould have understood that some shapes have only line symmetry , some have only\nrotational symmetry and some have both line symmetry and rotational symmetry .\nFor example, consider the square shape (Fig 12.19).\nHow many lines of symmetry does it have?\nDoes it have any rotational symmetry?\nIf ‘yes’, what is the order of the rotational symmetry?\nThink about it.\nThe circle is the most perfect symmetrical figure,\nbecause it can be rotated around its centre through\nany angle and at the same time it has unlimited number\nof lines of symm etry.

One thing common about most of these objects is\nthat they all have some length, breadth and height or depth.\nThat is, they all occupy space and have three dimensions.\nHence, they are called three dimensional shapes.\nDo you remember some of the three dimensional shapes (i.e., solid shapes) we have\nseen in earlier classes?\nTRY THESE\nFig 13.1(i) (a)Cuboid (iv) (d) Sphere\n(ii) (b)Cylinder (v) (e)Pyramid\n(iii) (c)Cube (vi) (f)ConeMatch the shape with the name:\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 199\nTry to identify some objects shaped like each of these.\nBy a similar argument, we can say figures drawn on paper which have only length and\nbreadth are called two dimensional (i.e., plane) figures. We have also seen some two\ndimensional figures in the earlier classes.\nMatch the 2 dimensional figures with the names (Fig 13.2):\n(i) (a)Circle\n(ii) (b) Rectangle\n(iii) (c)Square\n(iv) (d) Quadrilateral\n(v) (e)Triangl e\nFig 13.2\nNote: We can write 2-D in short for 2-dimension and 3-D in short for\n3-dimension.\n13.2  F ACES, EDGES AND VERTICES\nDo you remember the Faces, Vertices and Edges of solid shapes, which you studied\nearlier?  Here you see them for a cube:\n         (i)             (ii)            (iii)\nFig 13.3\nThe 8 corners of the cube are its vertices . The 12 line segments that form the\nskeleton of the cube are its edges . The 6 flat square surfaces that are the skin of the\ncube are its faces .\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 200\nCan you see that, the two dimensional figures can be identified as the faces of the\nthree dimensional shapes?  For example a cylinder  has two faces which are circles,\nand a pyramid, shaped like this  has triangles as its faces.\nWe will now try to see how some of these  3-D shapes can be visualised on a 2-D\nsurface, that is, on paper .\nIn order to do this, we would like to get familiar with three dimensional objects closely .\nLet us try forming these objects by making what are called nets.\n13.3  N ETS FOR BUILDING  3-D S HAPES\nTake a cardboard box.  Cut the edges to lay the box flat.  You have now a net for that box.\nA net is a sort of skeleton-outline in 2-D [Fig13.4 (i)], which, when folded [Fig13.4 (ii)],\nresults in a 3-D shape [Fig13.4 (iii)].DO THIS\nVertex\nFace\nEdgeFace\nVertex\nEdge\nFaces (F) 6 4\nEdges (E) 12\nVertices (V) 8 4\nComplete the following table:\nTable 13.1\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nFig 13.4\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 201\nHere you got a net by suitably separating the edges.

(You may use suitable units). The box is a\nsolid. It is a 3-D object with the shape of a cuboid.\nSimilarly , you can get a net for a cone by cutting a slit along\nits slant surface (Fig 13.6).\nYou have dif ferent nets for dif ferent shapes.  Copy\nenlarged versions of the nets given (Fig 1 3.7) and try to make\nthe 3-D shapes indicated.

One of you reads out a net to make a 3-D shape,\nwhile the other attempts to copy it and sketch or build the described 3-D object.\n13.4  D RAWING SOLIDS ON A FLAT SURFACE\nYour drawing surface is paper , which is flat. When you draw a solid shape, the images are\nsomewhat distorted to make them appear three-dimensional. It is a visual illusion. You will\nfind here two techniques to help you.\n13.4.1  Oblique Sketches\nHere is a picture of a cube (Fig 13.1 1). It gives a clear idea of how the cube looks like,\nwhen seen from the front. You do not see certain faces. In the drawn picture, the lengths Fig 13.1 1\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 204\nare not equal, as they should be in a cube. Still, you are able to recognise it as a cube. Such\na sketch of a solid is called an oblique sketch .\nHow can you draw such sketches? Let us attempt to learn the technique.\nYou need a squared (lines or dots) paper .  Initially practising to draw on these sheets will\nlater make it easy to sketch them on a plain sheet (without the aid of squared lines or dots!)\nLet us attempt to draw an oblique sketch of a 3 × 3 × 3 (each edge is 3 units) cube (Fig 1 3.12).\nStep 1 Step 2\nDraw the front  face. Draw the opposite  face. Sizes of the\nfaces have to be same, but the sketch\nis somewhat off-set from step 1.\nStep 3 Step 4\nJoin the corresponding corners Redraw using dotted lines for\nhidden edges. (It is a convention)\nThe sketch is ready now .\nFig 13.12\nIn the oblique sketch above, did you note the following?\n(i)The sizes of the front faces and its opposite are same; and\n(ii)The edges, which are all equal in a cube, appear so in the sketch, though the actual\nmeasures of edges are not taken so.\nYou could now try to make an oblique sketch of a cuboid (remember the faces in this\ncase are rectangles)\nNote: You can draw sketches in which measurements also agree with those of a given\nsolid. To do this we need what is known as an isometric sheet . Let us try to\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 205\nmake a cuboid with dimensions 4 cm length, 3 cm breadth and 3 cm height on\ngiven isometric sheet.\n13.4.2  Isometric Sketches\nHave you seen an isometric dot sheet? (A sample is given at the end of the book). Such a\nsheet divides the paper into small equilateral triangles made up of dots or lines. To draw\nsketches in which measur ements also agr ee with those of the solid, we can use isometric\ndot sheets. [Given on inside of the back cover (3rd cover page).]\nLet us attempt to draw an isometric sketch of a cuboid of dimensions 4 × 3 × 3 (which\nmeans the edges forming length, breadth and height are 4, 3, 3 units respectively) (Fig 1 3.13).\nStep 1 Step 2\nDraw a r ectangle to show the Draw four parallel line segments of\nfront face. length 3 star ting fr om the four corners\nof the r ectangle.\nStep 3 Step 4\nConnect the matching corners This is an isometric sketch\nwith appr opriate line segments. of the cuboid.\nFig 13.14 (i) Fig 13.14 (ii)Fig 13.13\nNote that the measurements are of exact size in an isometric sketch;\nthis is not so in the case of an oblique sketch.\nEXAMPLE  1Here is an oblique sketch of a cuboid [Fig 13.14(i)].\nDraw an isometric sketch that matches this drawing.\nSOLUTION Here is the solution [Fig 13.14(ii)]. Note how the\nmeasurements are taken care of.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 206\nHow many units have you taken along (i) ‘length’? (ii) ‘breadth’? (iii) ‘height’? Do\nthey match with the units mentioned in the oblique sketch?\nEXERCISE  13.2\n1.Use isometric dot paper and make an isometric sketch for each one of the\ngiven shapes:\nFig 13.15\n2.The dimensions of a cuboid are 5 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm.  Draw three different isometric\nsketches of this cuboid.\n3.Three cubes each with 2 cm edge are placed side by side to form a cuboid.

(Is your sketch unique?)\n(b)A cube with an edge 4 cm long.\nAn isometric sheet is attached at the end of the book. You could try to make on it some\ncubes or cuboids of dimensions specified by your friend.\n13.4.3  Visualising Solid Objects\nSometimes when you look at combined shapes, some of them may be hidden\nfrom your view .\nHere are some activities you could try in your free time to help you visualise some solid\nobjects and how they look. Take some cubes and arrange them as shown in\nFig 13.16.\nFig 13.16\nNow ask your friend to guess how many cubes there are when observed from the\nview shown by the arrow mark.\nTry to guess the number of cubes in the following arrangements (Fig 13.17).DO THIS\nHow\nmany\ncubes?\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nTRY THESE\n(i) (iii) (ii)\nFig 13.17\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 208\nSuch visualisation is very helpful. Suppose you form a cuboid by joining such cubes.\nYou will be able to guess what the length, breadth and height of the cuboid would be.\nEXAMPLE  2If two cubes of dimensions 2 cm by 2cm by 2cm are\nplaced side by side, what would the dimensions of the\nresulting cuboid be?\nSOLUTION As you can see (Fig 13.18) when kept side by side, the\nlength is the only measurement which increases, it be\ncomes 2 + 2 = 4 cm.\nThe breadth = 2 cm and the height = 2 cm.\n 1.Two dice are placed side by side as shown: Can you say what the total would be\non the face opposite to\n(a)5 + 6 (b)4 + 3\n(Remember that in a die sum of numbers on opposite faces is 7)\n 2.Three cubes each with 2 cm edge are placed side by side to form a cuboid. Try\nto make an oblique sketch and say what could be its length, breadth and height.\n13.5  V IEWING  DIFFERENT  SECTIONS  OF A SOLID\nNow let us see how an object which is in 3-D can be viewed in different ways.\n13.5.1 One W ay to View an Object is by Cutting or Slicing\nSlicing game\nHere is a loaf of bread (Fig 13.20).  It is like a cuboid with a square face. You  ‘slice’  it\nwith a knife.\nWhen you give a ‘vertical’ cut, you get several pieces, as shown in the\nFigure 13.20.   Each face of the piece is a square!  We call this face a\n‘cross-section’  of the whole bread.  The cross section is nearly a square in\nthis case.\nBeware! If your cut is not ‘vertical’ you may get a different cross section!\nThink about it. The boundary of the cross-section you obtain is a plane\ncurve.  Do you notice it?\nA kitchen play\nHave you noticed cross-sections of some vegetables when they are cut for the purposes\nof cooking in the kitchen?  Observe the various slices and get aware of the shapes that\nresult as cross-sections.Fig 13.18\nTRY THESE\nFig 13.19\nFig 13.20\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 209\nPlay this\nMake clay (or plasticine) models of the following solids and make vertical or horizontal cuts.\nDraw rough sketches of the cross-sections you obtain.  Name them wherever you can.\nFig 13.21\nEXERCISE  13.3\n1.What cross-sections do you get when you give a\n(i)vertical cut (ii)horizontal cut\nto the following solids?\n(a)A brick (b)A round apple (c)A die\n(d)A circular pipe (e)An ice cream cone\n13.5.2  Another W ay is by Shadow Play\nA shadow play\nShadows are a good way to illustrate how three-dimensional objects can be viewed in two\ndimensions. Have you seen a shadow play ? It is a form of   entertainment using solid\narticulated figures in front of an illuminated back-drop to create the illusion of moving\nimages.

Still it conveys all important\naspects of the appearance of the solid.\n(b)An isometric sketch  is drawn on an isometric dot paper , a sample of which is\ngiven at the end of this book.  In an isometric sketch of the solid the measurements\nkept proportional.\n7.Visualising solid shapes  is a very useful skill.  You should be able to see ‘hidden’\nparts of the solid shape.\n8.Different sections of a solid can be viewed in many ways:\n(a)One way is to view by cutting or slicing  the shape, which would result in the\ncross-section of the solid.\n(b)Another way is by observing a 2-D shadow  of a 3-D shape.\n(c)A third way is to look at the shape from dif\nferent angles; the fr ont-view , the\nside-view  and the top-view  can provide a lot of information about the shape\nobserved.\n2024-25\n"}

We have also learnt about\naddition and subtraction of integers.\n1.1.1  Closure under Addition\nWe have learnt that sum of two whole numbers is again a whole number . For example ,\n17 + 24 = 41 which is again a whole number . We know that, this property is known as the\nclosure property for addition of the whole numbers .\nLet us see whether this property is true for integers or not.\nFollowing are some pairs of integers. Observe the following table and complete it.\nStatement Observation\n(i)17 + 23 = 40 Result is an integer\n(ii)(–10) + 3 = _____ ______________\n(iii)(– 75) + 18 = _____ ______________\n(iv)19 + (– 25) = – 6 Result is an integer\n(v)27 + (– 27) = _____ ______________\n(vi)(– 20) + 0 = _____ ______________\n(vii) (– 35) + (– 10) = _____ ______________\nWhat do you observe? Is the sum of two integers always an integer?\nDid you find a pair of integers whose sum is not an integer?\nSince addition of integers gives integers, we say integers are closed under addition .\nIn general, for any two integers a and b,  a + b is an integer .\nChapter  1 Integers\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 2\n1.1.2  Closure under Subtraction\nWhat happens when we subtract an integer from another integer? Can we say that their\ndifference is also an integer?\nObserve the following table and complete it:\nStatement Observation\n(i)7 – 9 = – 2 Result is an integer\n(ii)17 – (– 21) = _______ ______________\n(iii)(– 8) – (–14) = 6 Result is an integer\n(iv)(– 21) – (– 10) = _______ ______________\n(v)32 – (–17) = _______ ______________\n(vi)(– 18) – (– 18) = _______ ______________\n(vii) (– 29) – 0 = _______ ______________\nWhat do you observe? Is there any pair of integers whose difference is not an integer?\nCan we say integers are closed under subtraction? Yes, we can see that integers are\nclosed under subtraction .\nThus, if a and b ar e two integers  then a – b is also an intger . Do the whole numbers\nsatisfy this property?\n1.1.3  Commutative Property\nWe know that 3 + 5 = 5 + 3 = 8, that is, the whole numbers can be added in any order . In\nother words, addition is commutative for whole numbers.\nCan we say the same for integers also?\nWe have 5 + (– 6) = –1 and (– 6) + 5 = –1\nSo, 5 + (– 6) = (– 6) + 5\nAre the following equal?\n(i)(– 8) + (– 9) and (– 9) + (– 8)\n(ii) (– 23) + 32 and 32 + (– 23)\n(iii) (– 45) + 0 and 0 + (– 45)\nTry this with five other pairs of integers.

Is it commutative\nfor  integers?\nConsider the integers 5 and (–3).\nIs 5 – (–3) the same as (–3) –5? No, because  5 – ( –3) = 5 + 3 = 8, and (–3) – 5\n= – 3 – 5 = – 8.\nTake atleast five dif ferent pairs of integers and check this.\nWe conclude that subtraction is not commutative for integers.\n1.1.4  Associative Property\nObserve the following examples:\nConsider the integers –3, –2 and –5.\nLook at (–5) + [(–3) + (–2)] and [(–5) + (–3)] + (–2).\nIn the first sum (–3) and (–2) are grouped together and in the second (–5) and (–3)\nare grouped together . We will check whether we get dif ferent results.\n(–5) + [(–3) + (–2)] [(–5) + (–3)] + (–2)\nIn both the cases, we get –10.\ni.e., (–5) + [(–3) + (–2)] = [(–5) + (–2)] + (–3)\nSimilarly consider  –3 , 1 and  –7.\n( –3) + [1 + (–7)] = –3 + __________ = __________\n[(–3) + 1] + (–7) = –2 + __________ = __________\nIs (–3) + [1 + (–7)] same as [(–3) + 1] + (–7)?\nTake five more such examples. You will not find any example for which the sums are\ndifferent. Addition is associative for integers .\nIn general for any integers a, b and c, we can say\na + (b+ c) = (a + b) + c\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 4\nTRY THESE\nEXAMPLE  1Write down a pair of integers whose\n(a)sum is –3 (b)difference is  –5\n(c)difference is 2 (d)sum is 0\nSOLUTION (a)(–1) + (–2) = –3 or (–5) + 2 = –3\n(b)(–9) – (– 4) = –5 or (–2) – 3 = –5\n(c)(–7) – (–9) = 2 or 1 – (–1) = 2\n(d)(–10) + 10 = 0 or 5 + (–5) = 0\n              Can you write more pairs in these examples?1.1.5  Additive Identity\nWhen we add zero to any whole number , we get the same whole number .

Let us now learn how to multiply integers.\n1.2.1  Multiplication of a Positive and a Negative Integer\nWe know that multiplication of whole numbers is repeated addition. For example,\n5 + 5 + 5 = 3 × 5 = 15\nCan you represent addition of integers in the same way?\nWe have from the following number line, (–5) + (–5) + (–5) = –15\nBut we can also write\n(–5) + (–5) + (–5) = 3 × (–5)\nTherefore, 3 × (–5) = –15–20 –15 –10 –5 0TRY THESE\nFind:\n4 × (– 8),\n8 × (–2),\n3 × (–7),\n10 × (–1)\nusing number line.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 6\nSimilarly (– 4) + (– 4) + (– 4) + (– 4) + (– 4) = 5 × (– 4) = –20\nAnd (–3) + (–3) + (–3) + (–3) = __________ = __________\nAlso, (–7) + (–7) + (–7) = __________ = __________\nLet us see how t o find the product of a positive integer and a negative integer without\nusing number line.\nLet us find 3 × (–5) in a dif ferent way . First find 3 × 5 and then put minus sign (–)\nbefore the product obtained. You get –15. That is we find – (3 × 5) to get –15.\nSimilarly , 5 × (– 4) = – (5×4) = – 20.\nFind in a similar way ,\n4 × (– 8) = _____  = _____,  3 × (– 7) = _____ = _____\n6 × (– 5) = _____  = _____,  2 × (– 9) = _____ = _____\nUsing this method we thus have,\n10 × (– 43) = _____ – (10 × 43) = – 430\nTill now we multiplied integers as (positive integer) × (negative integer).\nLet us now multiply them as (negative integer) × (positive integer).\nWe first find –3 × 5.\nTo find this, observe the following pattern:\nWe have, 3 × 5 = 15\n2 × 5 = 10 = 15 – 5\n1 × 5 = 5 = 10 – 5\n0 × 5 = 0 = 5 – 5\nSo, –1 × 5 = 0 – 5 = –5\n–2 × 5 = –5 – 5 = –10\n–3 × 5 = –10 – 5 = –15\nWe alread y have 3 × (–5) = –15\nSo we get (–3) × 5 = –15 = 3 × (–5)\nUsing such patterns, we also get (–5) × 4 = –20 = 5 × (– 4)\nUsing patterns, find (– 4) × 8, (–3) × 7, (– 6) × 5 and (– 2) × 9\nCheck whether ,(– 4) × 8 = 4 × (– 8), (– 3) × 7 = 3 × (–7), (– 6) × 5 = 6 × (– 5)–20 –16 –12 –8 –4 0\nTRY THESE\nFind:\n(i)6 × (–19)\n(ii)12 × (–32)\n(iii) 7 × (–22)\n2024-25\n\nINTEGERS 7\nTRY THESE\nand (– 2) × 9 = 2 × (– 9)\nUsing this we get, (–33) × 5 = 33 × (–5) = –165\nWe thus find that while multiplying a positive integer and a negative integer , we\nmultiply them as whole numbers and put a minus sign (–) befor e the pr oduct.

She cut this strip into four equal parts. How did she\ndo it? She folded the strip twice. What fraction of the total length will each part represent?\nEach part will be 9\n4 of the strip. She took one part and divided it in two equal parts by\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 26\nfolding the part once. What will one of the pieces represent? It will represent 1\n2 of 9\n4 or\n1\n2 × 9\n4.\nLet us now see how to find the product of two fractions like 1\n2 × 9\n4.\nTo do this we first learn to find the products like 1\n2 × 1\n3.\n(a)How do we find  1\n3of a whole? We divide the whole in three equal parts. Each of\nthe three parts represents 1\n3of the whole. Take one part of these three parts, and\nshade it as shown in Fig 2.8.\n(b) How will you find 1\n2of this shaded part? Divide this one-third (1\n3) shaded part into\ntwo equal parts. Each of these two parts represents 1\n2 of  1\n3 i.e., 1\n2 × 1\n3(Fig 2.9).\n        Take out 1 part of these two and name it ‘A ’. ‘A’ represents 1\n2 × 1\n3.\n(c)What fraction is ‘A ’ of the whole? For this, divide each of the remaining 1\n3 parts also\nin two equal parts. How many such equal parts do you have now?\nThere are six such equal parts. ‘A ’ is one of these parts.\nSo, ‘A ’ is 1\n6 of the whole. Thus,  1\n2 × 1\n3  =  1\n6.\nHow did we decide that ‘A ’ was 1\n6 of the whole? The whole was divided in 6 = 2 × 3\nparts and 1 = 1 × 1 part was taken out of it.\nThus,1\n2 × 1\n3 =1\n6  = 1×1\n2×3\nor1\n2 × 1\n3 =1×1\n2×3Fig 2.8\nFig 2.9A\n2024-25\n\nFRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 27\nThe value of 1\n3×1\n2 can be found in a similar way . Divide the whole into two equal\nparts and then  divide one of these parts in three equal parts. Take one of these parts. This\nwill represent  1\n3 × 1\n2 i.e., 1\n6.\nTherefore1\n3× 1\n2 =1\n6 = 1×1\n3× 2 as discussed earlier .\nHence1\n2 × 1\n3 =1\n3× 1\n2= 1\n6\nFind  1\n3×1\n4 and 1\n4 × 1\n3; 1\n2× 1\n5  and  1\n5× 1\n2 and check whether you get\n1\n3×1\n4 =1\n4 × 1\n3;  1\n2× 1\n5 = 1\n5× 1\n2\nFill in these boxes:\n(i)1\n2 × 1\n7 =  1×1\n2 × 7 = (ii)1\n5× 1\n7   =   = \n(iii)1\n7 × 1\n2   =  = (iv)1\n7 × 1\n5 =  = \nEXAMPLE  2Sushant reads 1\n3 part of a book in 1 hour . How much part of the book\nwill he read in125 hours?\nSOLUTION   The part of the book read by Sushant in 1 hour  = 1\n3.\nSo, the part of the book read by him in 125 hours = 125× 1\n3\n= 11\n5× 1\n3 11 1\n5 3×=× = 11\n15\nLet us now find 1\n2×5\n3. We know that   5\n3 =  1\n3× 5 .\nSo,  1\n2× 5\n3 =  1\n2× 1\n3× 5 = 1\n655\n6□=TRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 28\nAlso, 5\n6 =  1× 5\n2 × 3. Thus, 1\n2× 5\n3 = 1× 5\n2 × 3 = 5\n6.\nThis is also shown by the figures drawn below . Each of these five equal shapes\n(Fig 2.10) are parts of five similar circles. Take one such shape. To obtain this shape\nwe first divide a circle in three  equal parts. Further divide each of these three  parts in\ntwo equal parts. One part out of it is the shape we considered. What will it represent?\nIt will represent 1\n2 × 1\n3 = 1\n6. The total of such parts would be  5  × 1\n6 = 5\n6.\nSimilarly3\n5 × 1\n7 =3×1\n5× 7 = 3\n35.\nWe can thus find  2\n3× 7\n5 as2\n3 × 7\n5 = 2 × 7\n3× 5 = 14\n15.\nSo, we find that we multiply two fractions as Product of Numerators\nProduct of Denominators.\nValue of the Pr oducts\nYou have seen that the product of two whole numbers is bigger than each of\nthe two whole numbers.

Let us see how to do that.\n2.2.1  Division of Whole Number by a Fraction\nLet us find 1 ÷1\n2.\nWe divide a whole into a number of equal parts such that each part is half of the whole.\nThe number of such half (1\n2) parts would be 1÷1\n2. Observe the figure (Fig 2.1 1). How\nmany half parts do you see?\nThere are two half parts.\nSo, 1 ÷ 1\n2 = 2. Also, 211× = 1 × 2 = 2. Thus, 1 ÷ 1\n2 = 1 × 2\n1\nSimilarly , 3 ÷1\n4 = number of 1\n4parts obtained when each of the 3 whole, are divided\ninto 1\n4equal parts = 12 (From Fig 2.12)\nFig 2.12\nObserve also that, 43×1 =  3 × 4  = 12.

How much money should\nshe pay? Certainly it would be ` (8.50 × 1.50). Both 8.5 and 1.5 are decimal numbers.\nSo, we have come across a situation where we need to know how to multiply two deci-\nmals. Let us now learn the multiplication of two decimal numbers.\nFirst we find 0.1 × 0.1.\nNow , 0.1 = 1\n10. So, 0.1 × 0.1 = 1 1×10 10 =\n1×1\n10 ×10 = 1\n100 = 0.01.\nLet us see it’ s pictorial representation (Fig 2.13)\nThe fraction 1\n10 represents 1 part out of 10 equal\nparts.\nFig 2.13\n2024-25\n\nFRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 35\nThe shaded part in the picture represents 1\n10.\nWe know that,\n1 1×10 10 means 1\n10 of 1\n10. So, divide this 1\n10th part into 10 equal parts and take one\npart out of it.\nThus, we have, (Fig 2.14).\n        \nFig 2.14\nThe dotted square is one part out of 10 of the 1\n10th part. That is, it represents\n1 1×10 10 or  0.1 × 0.1.\nCan the dotted square be represented in some other way?\nHow many small squares do you find in Fig 2.14?\nThere are 100 small squares. So the dotted square represents one out of 100 or 0.01.\nHence, 0.1 × 0.1 = 0.01.\nNote that 0.1 occurs two times in the product. In 0.1 there is\none digit to the right of the decimal point. In 0.01 there are two\ndigits (i.e., 1 + 1) to the right of the decimal point.\nLet us now find 0.2 × 0.3.\nWe have, 0.2 × 0.3 = 2 3×10 10\nAs we did for 1 1\n10 10×, let us divide the square into 10 equal\nparts and take three parts out of it, to get 3\n10. Again divide each\nFig 2.15\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 36\nTRY THESEof these three equal parts into 10 equal parts and take two from each. We get 2 3×10 10.\nThe dotted squares represent 2 3×10 10 or 0.2 × 0.3. (Fig 2.15)\nSince there are 6 dotted squares out of 100, so they also reprsent 0.06.\nThus, 0.2 × 0.3 = 0.06.\nObserve that 2 × 3 = 6 and the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in 0.06\nis 2 (= 1 + 1).\nCheck whether this applies to 0.1 ×  0.1 also.\nFind 0.2 ×  0.4 by applying these observations.\nWhile finding 0.1 × 0.1 and 0.2 × 0.3, you might have noticed that first we multiplied\nthem as whole numbers ignoring the decimal point. In 0.1 × 0.1, we found 01 × 01 or 1 ×\n1. Similarly in 0.2 × 0.3 we found 02 ×\n 03 or 2 × 3.\nThen, we counted the number of digits starting from the rightmost digit and moved\ntowards left. We then put the decimal point there. The number of digits to be counted is\nobtained by adding the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the decimal\nnumbers that are being multiplied.\nLet us now find 1.2 × 2.5.\nMultiply 12 and 25. We get 300. Both, in 1.2 and 2.5, there is 1 digit to the right of the\ndecimal point. So, count 1 + 1 = 2 digits from the rightmost digit (i.e., 0) in 300 and move\ntowards left. We get 3.00 or 3.\nFind in a similar way 1.5 × 1.6, 2.4 × 4.2.\nWhile multiplying 2.5 and 1.25, you will first multiply 25 and 125. For placing the\ndecimal in the product obtained, you will count 1 + 2 = 3 (Why?) digits starting from the\nrightmost digit. Thus, 2.5 × 1.25 = 3.225\nFind 2.7 × 1.35.\n   1. Find: (i) 2.7 × 4 (ii) 1.8 × 1.2 (iii) 2.3 × 4.35\n   2. Arrange the products obtained in (1) in descending order .\nEXAMPLE  3 The side of an equilateral triangle is 3.5 cm. Find its perimeter .\nSOLUTION All the sides of an equilateral triangle are equal.\n2024-25\n\nFRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 37\nSo, length of each side = 3.5 cm\nThus, perimeter = 3 × 3.5 cm = 10.5 cm\nEXAMPLE  4 The length of a rectangle is 7.1 cm and its breadth is 2.5 cm.\nWhat is the area of the rectangle?\nSOLUTION Length of the rectangle = 7.1 cm\nBreadth of the rectangle = 2.5 cm\nTherefore, area of the rectangle = 7.1 × 2.5 cm2 = 17.75 cm2\n2.3.1 Multiplication of Decimal Numbers by 10, 100 and 1000\nReshma observed that 2.3 = 23\n10 whereas 2.35 = 235\n100. Thus, she found that depending\non the position of the decimal point the decimal number can be converted to a fraction with\ndenominator 10 or 100. She wondered what would happen if a decimal number is multiplied\nby 10 or 100 or 1000.\nLet us see if we can find a pattern of multiplying numbers by 10 or 100 or 1000.\nHave a look at the table given below and fill in the blanks:\n1.76 × 10  = 176\n100× 10 = 17.6 2.35 ×10 =___ 12.356 × 10 =___\n1.76 × 100 = 176\n100× 100 = 176 or 176.0 2.35 ×100 = ___ 12.356 × 100 =___\n1.76 × 1000 = 176\n100 × 1000 = 1760   or 2.35 ×1000 = ___ 12.356 × 1000 = ___\n                                                1760.0\n0.5 × 10 = 5\n10 × 10 = 5     ;     0.5 × 100 = ___     ;     0.5 × 1000 = ___\nObserve t he shift of the decimal point of the products in the table. Here the numbers are\nmultiplied by 10,100 and 1000. In 1.76 × 10 = 17.6, the digits are same i.e., 1, 7 and 6.  Do\nyou observe this in other products also? Observe 1.76 and 17.6.

In 31.5 and 3.15, the digits are\nsame i.e., 3, 1, and 5 but the decimal point has shifted in the\nquotient. To which side and by how many digits? The decimal\npoint has shifted to the left by one place. Note that 10 has one\nzero over 1.\nConsider now 31. 5 ÷100 = 0.315. In 31.5 and 0.315 the\ndigits are same, but what about the decimal point in the quotient?\nIt has shifted to the left by two places. Note that 100 has two\nzeros over1.\nSo we can say that, while dividing a number by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits of the\nnumber and the quotient ar e same but the decimal point in the quotient shifts to the\nleft by as many places as ther e are zer os over 1.  Using this observation let us now\nquickly find:        2.3 8 ÷ 10 = 0.238,  2.3 8 ÷ 100 = 0.0238, 2.3 8÷ 1000 = 0.00238\n2.4.2  Division of a Decimal Number by a Whole Number\nLet us find 6.4\n2.

Making similar placement of the decimal in 324, you\nwill get 3.24.\nNote that here and in the next section, we have considered only those divisions in\nwhich, ignoring the decimal, the number would be completely divisible by another number\nto give remainder zero. Like, in 19.5 ÷ 5, the number 195 when divided by 5, leaves\nremainder zero.\nHowever , there are situations in which the number may not be completely divisible by\nanother number , i.e., we may not get remainder zero.

Accordingly\n25.5 was also converted to a fraction by dividing by 10.\nOr, we say the decimal point was shifted by one place to the right in 0.5 to make it 5.\nSo, there was a shift of one decimal point to the right in 25.5 also to make it 255.\nThus, 22.5 ÷ 1.5  = 22 5\n1 5.\n. = 225\n15 = 15\nFind20 3\n0 7.\n. and 15 2\n0 8.\n. in a similar way .\nLet us now find 20.55 ÷ 1.5.\nWe can write it is as 205.5 ÷ 15, as discussed above.

Count the number of digits to the right\nof the decimal point in both the decimal numbers.

Then place the decimal point in the quotient as in the decimal number .\nFor example, 8.4 ÷ 4 = 2.1\nNote that here we consider only those divisions in which the remainder is zero.\n(b) To divide a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, shift the digits in the decimal\nnumber to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1, to get the\nquotient.\nSo, 23.9 ÷ 10 = 2.39, 23.9 ÷ 100 = 0 .239, 23.9 \n÷ 1000 = 0.0239\n(c)While dividing two decimal numbers, first shift the decimal point to the right by\nequal number of places in both, to convert the divisor to a whole number .

Think about the statements given above.\nDo you think that the child in the first statement studies exactly for 5 hours daily?\nOr, is the temperature of the given place during that particular time always 40 degrees?\nOr, is the age of each pupil in that class 12 years? Obviously not.\nThen what do these statements tell you?\nBy average we understand that Isha, usually , studies for 5 hours. On some days, she\nmay study for less number of hours and on the other days she may study longer .\nSimilarly , the average temperature of 40 degree celsius, means that, very often, the\ntemperature at this time of the year is around 40 degree celsius. Sometimes, it may be less\nthan 40 degree celsius and at other times, it may be more than 40°C.\nThus, we realise that average is a number that represents or shows the central tendency\nof a group of observations or data. Since average lies between the highest and the lowest\nvalue of the given data so, we say average is a measure of the central tendency of the\ngroup of data. Different forms of data need different forms of representative or central\nvalue to describe it. One of these representative values is the “ Arithmetic mean ”. You\nwill learn about the other representative values in the later part of the chapter .\nData\nHandling\nChapter  3\n2024-25\n\nDATA HANDLING 45\n3.2  A RITHMETIC  MEAN\nThe most common representative value of a group of data is the arithmetic  mean  or the\nmean . To understand this in a better way , let us look at the following example:\nTwo vessels contain 20 litres and 60 litres of milk respectively . What is the amount that\neach vessel would have, i f both share the milk equally? When we ask this question we are\nseeking the arithmetic mean.\nIn the above case, the average or the arithmetic mean would be\nTotal quantity of milk\nNumber of vessels = 20 60\n2+ litres = 40 litres.\nThus, each vessels would have 40 litres of milk.\nThe average or Arithmetic Mean (A.M.) or simply mean is defined as follows:\nmean = Sum of all observations\nnumber of observations\nConsider these examples.\nEXAMPLE 1Ashish studies for 4 hours, 5 hours and 3 hours respectively on three\nconsecutive days. How many hours does he study daily on an average?\nSOLUTION The average study time of Ashish would be\nTotal number of study hours\nNumber of days for which he stu d died = 4 5 3\n3+ +\n hours = 4 hours per day\nThus, we can say that Ashish studies for 4 hours daily on an average.\nEXAMPLE 2 A batsman scored the following number of runs in six innings:\n36, 35, 50, 46, 60, 55\nCalculate the mean runs scored by him in an inning.\nSOLUTION Total runs = 36 + 35 + 50 + 46 + 60 + 55 = 282.\nTo find the mean, we find the sum of all the observations and divide it by the number of\nobservations.\nTherefore, in this case, mean = 282\n6 = 47. Thus, the mean runs scored in an inning are 47.\nWhere does the arithmetic mean lie\nTRY THESE\nHow would you find the average of your study hours for the whole week?\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 46\nTHINK, DISCUSS  AND WRITE\nConsider the data in the above examples and think on the following:\n/circle6Is the mean bigger than each of the observations?\n/circle6Is it smaller than each observation?\nDiscuss with your friends. Frame one more example of this type\nand answer the same questions.\nYou will find that the mean lies inbetween the greatest and the smallest\nobservations.\nIn particular , the mean of two numbers will always lie between the two numbers. For\nexample the mean of 5 and 1 1 is 5 11\n28+=, which lies between 5 and 1 1.\nCan you use this idea to show that between any two fractional numbers, you can find\nas many fractional numbers as you like. For example between 1\n2 and 1\n4 you have their\naverage 1\n21\n4\n2+\n = 3\n8 and then between 1\n2 and 3\n8, you have their average 7\n16\nand so on.\n1.Find the mean of your sleeping hours during one week.\n2.Find atleast 5 numbers between 1\n2 and 1\n3.\n3.2.1  Range\nThe d ifference between the highest and the lowest observation gives us an idea of the\nspread of the observations. This can be found by subtracting the lowest observation from\nthe highest observation. We call the result the range of the observation. Look at the\nfollowing example:\nEXAMPLE  3 The ages in years of 10 teachers of a school are:\n  32, 41, 28, 54, 35, 26, 23, 33, 38, 40\n(i)What is the age of the oldest teacher and that of the youngest teacher?\n(ii)What is the range of the ages of the teachers?\n(iii) What is the mean age of these teachers?\nSOLUTION\n(i)Arranging the ages in ascending order , we get:\n23, 26, 28, 32, 33, 35, 38, 40, 41, 54\nWe find that the age of the oldest teacher is 54 years and the age of the youngest\nteacher is 23 years.TRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nDATA HANDLING 47\n(ii)Range of the ages of the teachers = (54 – 23) years = 31 years\n(iii) Mean age of the tea chers\n= 23 26 28 32 33 35 38 40 41 54\n10+ + + + + + + + +years\n= 350\n10years  = 35 years\nEXERCISE  3.1\n1.Find the rang e of heights of any ten students of your class.\n2.Organise the following marks in a class assessment, in a tabular form.\n4, 6, 7, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 2, 6, 2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 4, 6, 7\n(i)Which number  is the highest?

For different requirements from a data, other measures of central\ntendencies are used.\nLook at the following example\nTo find out the weekly demand for dif ferent sizes of shirt, a shopkeeper kept records of sales\nof sizes 90 cm, 95 cm, 100 cm, 105 cm, 1 10 cm. Following is the record for a week:\nSize (in inches) 90 cm 95 cm 100 cm 105 cm 110 cm Total\nNumber of Shirts Sold 8\n22 32 37 6 105\nIf he found the mean number of shirts sold, do you think that he would be able to\ndecide which shirt sizes to keep in stock?\nMean of total shirts sold = Total number of shirts sold\nNumber of different sizes of sh i irts= =105\n521\nShould he obtain 21 shirts of each size? If he does so, will he be able to cater to the\nneeds of the customers?\n2024-25\n\nDATA HANDLING 49\nThe shopkeeper , on looking at the record, decides to procure shirts of sizes 95 cm,\n100 cm, 105 cm. He decided to postpone the procurement of the shirts of other sizes\nbecause of their small number of buyers.\nLook at another example\nThe owner of a readymade dress shop says, “The most popular size of\ndress I sell is the size 90 cm.\nObserve that here also, the owner is concerned about the number of\nshirts of different sizes sold. She is however looking at the shirt size that is\nsold the most. This is another representative value for the data. The highest\noccuring event is the sale of size 90 cm.This representative value is called\nthe mode  of the data.\nThe mode of a set of observations is the observation that occurs most often.\nEXAMPLE  4 Find the mode of the given set of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4\nSOLUTION Arranging the numbers with same values together , we get\n1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4\nMode of this data is 2 because it occurs more frequently than other observations.\n3.3.1  Mode of Large Data\nPutting the same observations together and counting them is not easy if the number of\nobservations is lar ge. In such cases we tabulate the data. Tabulation can begin by putting\ntally marks and finding the frequency , as you did in your previous class.\nLook at the following example:\nEXAMPLE  5Following are the margins of victory in the football\nmatches of a league.\n1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2 ,\n6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2\nFind the mode of this data.\nSOLUTION Let us put the data  in a tabular form:\nMargins of Victor y Tally Bars Number of Matches\n1 9\n2 14\n3 7\n4 5\n5 3\n6 2\nTotal 40\nFind the mode of\n(i)2, 6, 5, 3, 0, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5,\n2, 4\n(ii)2, 14, 16, 12, 14, 14, 16,\n14, 10, 14, 18, 14TRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 50\nLooking at the table, we can quickly say that 2 is the ‘mode’ since 2 has occured the\nhighest number of times. Thus, most of the matches have been won with a victory margin\nof 2 goals.\nTHINK, DISCUSS  AND WRITE\nCan a set of numbers have more than one mode?\nEXAMPLE  6Find the mode of the numbers:  2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8\nSOLUTION Here, 2 and 5 both occur three times. Therefore, they both are modes of\nthe data.\n 1.Record the age in years of all your classmates. Tabulate the data and find the mode.\n 2.Record the heights in centimetres of your classmates and find the mode.\n 1.Find the mode of the following data:\n12, 14, 12, 16, 15, 13, 14, 18, 19, 12, 14, 15, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15,\n17, 13, 16, 16, 15, 15, 13, 15, 17, 15, 14, 15, 13, 15, 14\n 2.Heights (in cm) of 25 children are given below:\n168, 165, 163, 160, 163, 161, 162, 164, 163,  162, 164, 163, 160, 163, 160,\n165, 163, 162, 163, 164, 163, 160, 165, 163, 162\nWhat is the mode of their heights?  What do we understand by mode here?\nWhereas mean gives us the average of all observations of the data, the mode gives that\nobser vation which occurs most frequently in the data.\nLet us consider the following examples:\n(a)You have to decide upon the number of chapattis needed for 25 people called for a\nfeast.\n(b) A shopkeeper selling shirts has decided to replenish her stock.\n(c)We need to find the height of the door needed in our house.\n(d) When going on a picnic, if only one fruit can be bought for everyone, which is the\nfruit that we would get.\nIn which of these situations can we use the mode as a good estimate?\nConsider the first statement. Suppose the number of chapattis needed by each person\nis    2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5DO THIS\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nDATA HANDLING 51\nTRY THESE\nThe mode of the data is 2 chapattis. If we use mode as the representative value for this\ndata, then we need 50 chapattis only , 2 for each of the 25 persons. However the total\nnumber would clearly be inadequate. Would mean  be an appropriate representative value?\nFor the third statement the height of the door is related to the height\nof the persons using that door . Suppose there are 5 children and 4\nadults using the door and the height of each of 5 children is around 135\ncm. The mode for the heights is 135  cm. Should we get a door that is\n144 cm high? Would all the adults be able to go through that door? It is\nclear that mode is not the appropriate representative value for this data.\nWould mean  be an appropriate representative value here?\nWhy not? Which representative value of height should be used to\ndecide the doorheight?\nSimilarly analyse the rest of the statements and find the representative\nvalue useful for that iss ue.\nDiscuss with  your friends and give\n(a)   Two situations where mean would be an appropriate representative value\nto use, and\n(b)   Two situations where mode would be  an appropriate representative value\nto use.\n3.4  M EDIAN\nWe have seen that in some situations, arithmetic mean is an appropriate measure of central\ntendency whereas in some other situations, mode is the appropriate measure of central\ntendency .\nLet us now look at another example. Consider a group of 17 students with the following\nheights (in cm): 106, 1 10, 123, 125, 1 17, 120, 1 12, 115, 1 10, 120, 1 15, 102, 1 15, 1 15,\n109, 1 15, 101.\nThe games teacher wants to divide the class into two groups so that each group has\nequal number of students, one group has students with height lesser than a particular height\nand the other group has students with heights greater than the particular height. How\nwould she do that?\nLet us see the various options she has:\n(i)She can find the mean. The mean is\n= =1930\n17113 5 .106 110 123 125 117 120 112 115 110 120 115 102 115 115 10+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + 9 9 115 101\n17+ +\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 52\nSo, if the teacher divides the students into two groups on the basis of this mean height,\nsuch that one group has students of height less than the mean height and the other group\nhas students with height more than the mean height, then the groups would be of unequal\nsize. They would have 7 and 10 members respectively .\n(ii)The second option for her is to find mode. The observation with highest frequency is\n115 cm, which would be taken as mode.\nThere are 7 children below the mode and 10 children at the mode and above the\nmode. Therefore, we cannot divide the group into equal parts.\nLet us therefore think of an alternative representative value or measure of central\ntendency . For doing this we again look at the given heights (in cm) of students and arrange\nthem in ascending order . We have the following observations:\n101, 102, 106, 109, 1 10, 1 10, 1\n12, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 1 17, 120, 120, 123, 125\nThe middle value in this data is 1 15 because this value\ndivides the students into two equal groups of 8 students each.\nThis value is called as Median . Median refers to the value\nwhich lies in the middle of the data (when arranged in an\nincreasing or decreasing order) with half of the observations\nabove it and the other half below it. The games teacher decides\nto keep the middle student as a refree in the game .\nHere, we consider only those cases where number of\nobservations is odd.\nThus, in a given d ata, arranged in ascending or descending order , the median  gives us\nthe middle obse rvation.\nNote that in g eneral, we may not get the same value for median and mode.\nThus we realise that mean, mode and median are the numbers that are the representative\nvalues of a group of observations or data. They lie between the minimum and maximum\nvalues of the data. They are also called the measures of the central tendency .\nEXAMPLE 7Find the median of the data: 24, 36, 46, 17, 18, 25, 35\nSOLUTION We arrange the data in ascending order , we get 17, 18, 24, 25, 35, 36, 46\nMedian is the middle observation. Therefore 25 is the median.\nEXERCISE  3.2\n1.The s cores in mathematics test (out of 25) of 15 students is as follows:\n19, 25, 23, 20, 9, 20, 15, 10, 5, 16, 25, 20, 24, 12, 20\nFind the mode and median of this data.

You can look at the bar graphs and make deductions\nabout the data. You can also get information based on these bar graphs. For example, you\ncan say that the mode is the longest bar if the bar represents the frequency .\n3.5.1 Choosing a Scale\nWe know that a bar graph is a representation of numbers using bars of uniform width and\nthe lengths of the bars depend upon the frequency and the scale you have chosen. For\nexample, in a bar graph where numbers in units are to be shown, the graph represents one\nunit length for one observation and if it has to show numbers in tens or hundreds, one unit\nlength can represent 10 or 100 ob servations. Consider the following examples:\nEXAMPLE 8Two hundred students of 6th and 7th classes were asked to name their\nfavourite colour so as to decide upon what should be the colour of their\nschool building. The results are shown in the following table. Represent\nthe given data on a bar graph.\nFavourite Colour Red Green Blue Yellow Orange\nNumber  of Students 43 19 55\n49 34\nAnswer the f ollowing questions with the help of the bar graph:\n(i)Which is the most preferred colour and which is the least preferred?\n(ii)How many colours are there in all? What are they?\nSOLUTION Choose a suitable scale as follows:\nStart the scale at 0. The greatest value in the data is 55, so end the scale at a value greater\nthan 55, such as 60. Use equal divisions along the axes, such as increments of 10. You\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 54\nknow that all the bars would lie between 0\nand 60. We choose the scale such that the\nlength between 0 and 60 is neither too long\nnor too small. Here we take 1 unit for 10\nstudents.\nWe then draw and label the graph as shown.\nFrom the bar graph we conclude that\n(i)Blue is the most preferred colour\n(Because the bar representing Blue is the\ntallest).\n(ii)Green is the least preferred colour .\n(Because the bar representing Green is\nthe shortest).\n(iii) There are five colours. They are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Orange. (These are\nobserved on the horizontal line)\nEXAMPLE 9Following data gives total marks (out of 600) obtained by six children of a\nparticular class. Represent the data on a bar graph.\nStudents Ajay Bali Dipti Faiyaz Geetika Hari\nMarks Obtained 450 500 300\n360 400 540\nSOLUTION\n(i)To choose an appropriate scale we make equal divisions taking increments of 100.\nThus 1 unit will represent 100 marks. (What would be the difficulty if we choose one\nunit to represent 1 0 marks?)\n(ii)Now represent the data on the bar graph.\n2024-25\n\nDATA HANDLING 55\nFig 3.1134374172164\n112132152152162142314\nDrawing double bar graph\nConsider the following two collections of data giving the average daily hours of sunshine in\ntwo cities Aberdeen and Mar gate for all the twelve months of the year .

To do this we\nwill learn to draw what is called a double bar graph giving the information of both cities\nside-by-side.\nThis bar graph (Fig 3.1) shows the average sunshine of both the cities.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 56\nFor each month we have two bars, the heights of which give the average hours of\nsunshine in each city . From this we can infer that except for the month of April, there is\nalways more sunshine in Mar gate than in Aberdeen. You could put together a similiar bar\ngraph for your area or for your city .\nLet us look at another example more related to us.\nEXAMPLE 10 A mathematics teacher wants to see, whether the new technique of\nteaching she applied after quarterly test was effective or not.

{"class": "7", "subject": "math", "chapter": "Chapter 4: simple equations", "content": "SIMPLE EQU ATIONS 59\n4.1A M IND-READING  GAME!\nThe teacher has said that she would be starting a new chapter in\nmathematics and it is going to be simple equations. Appu, Sarita\nand Ameena have revised what they learnt in algebra chapter in\nClass VI. Have you? Appu , Sarita and Ameena are excited because\nthey have constructed a game which they call mind reader and they\nwant to present it to the whole class.\nThe teacher appreciates their enthusiasm and invites them to present their game. Ameena\nbegins; she asks Sara to think of a number , multiply it by 4 and add 5 to the product. Then,\nshe asks Sara to tell the result. She says it is 65. Ameena instantly declares that the number\nSara had thought of is 15. Sara nods. The whole class including Sara is surprised.\nIt is Appu’ s turn now . He asks Balu to think of a number , multiply it by 10 and subtract\n20 from the product. He then asks Balu what his result is? Balu says it is 50. Appu\nimmediately tells the number thought by Balu. It is 7,  Balu confirms it.\nEverybody wants to know how the ‘mind reader ’ presented by Appu, Sarita and\nAmeena works. Can you see how it works? After studying this chapter and chapter 12,\nyou will very well know how the game works.\n4.2  S ETTING  UP OF AN EQUATION\nLet us take Ameena’ s example. Ameena asks Sara to think of a number . Ameena does not\nknow the number . For her , it could be anything 1, 2, 3, . . ., 1 1, . . . , 100, . . . . Let us\ndenote this unknown number by a letter , say x. You may use y or t or some other letter in\nplace of \nx. It does not matter which letter we use to denote the unknown number Sara has\nthought of. When Sara multiplies the number by 4, she gets 4 x. She then adds 5 to the\nproduct, which gives 4 x + 5. The value of (4 x + 5) depends on the value of x. Thus\nif x = 1, 4x + 5 = 4 ×1 + 5 = 9. This means that if Sara had 1 in her mind, her result would\nhave been 9. Similarly , if she thought o f 5, then for x  = 5, 4 x + 5 = 4 × 5 + 5 = 25; Thus\nif Sara had chosen 5, the result would have been 25.\nChapter  4Simple\nEquations\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 60\nTo find the number thought by Sara let us work backward from her answer 65. We\nhave to find x such that\n4\nx + 5 = 65 (4.1)\nSolution to the equation will give us the number which Sara held in her mind.\nLet us similarly look at Appu’ s example. Let us call the number Balu chose as y. Appu\nasks Balu to multiply the number by 10 and subtract 20 from the product. That is, from y,\nBalu first gets 10 y and from there (10 y – 20). The result is known to be 50.\nTherefore, 10y – 20 = 50 (4.2)\nThe solution of this equation will give us the number Balu had thought of.\n4.3  REVIEW OF WHAT WE KNOW\nNote, (4.1) and (4.2) are equations. Let us recall what we learnt about equations in\nClass VI. An equation is a condition on a variable.  In equation (4.1), the variable is x;\nin equation (4.2), the variable is y.\nThe word variable  means something that can vary , i.e. change. A variable  takes on\ndiffer ent numerical values ; its value is not fixed. V ariables ar e denoted usually by\nletters of the alphabets, such as x, y , z, l, m, n, p, etc . From variables , we form\nexpressions . The expressions are formed by performing operations like addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication and division on the variables. From x, we formed the expression (4 x + 5).\nFor this, first we multiplied x by 4 and then added 5 to the product. Similarly , from y, we\nformed the expression (10 y – 20). For this, we multiplied y by 10 and then subtracted 20\nfrom the product. All these are examples of expressions.\nThe value of an expression thus formed depends upon the chosen value of the variable.\nAs we have already seen, when x = 1, 4 x + 5 = 9; when \nx = 5, 4 x + 5 = 25. Similarly ,\nwhen x =15,  4  x + 5 = 4×15 + 5 = 65;\nwhen x =0,  4 x + 5 = 4 × 0 + 5 = 5; and so on.\nEquation (4.1) is a condition on the variable x. It states that the value of the expression\n(4x + 5) is 65. The condition is satisfied when x = 15. It is the solution to the equation\n4x + 5 = 65. When x  = 5, 4 x + 5 = 25 and not 65. Thus x = 5 is not a solution to the\nequation. Similarly , x = 0 is not a solution to the equation. No value of x other than 15\nsatisfies the condition 4 x + 5 = 65.\nThe value of the expression (10 y – 20) depends on the value of y. Verify this by\ngiving five different values to y and finding for each y the value of (10  y – 20). From\nthe different values of (10 y – 20) you obtain, do you see a solution to 10y  – 20 = 50?\nIf there is no solution, try giving more values to y and find whether the condition\n10y – 20 = 50 is met.TRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nSIMPLE EQU ATIONS 61\n4.4  W HAT EQUATION  IS?\nIn an eq uation there is always an equality sign. The equality sign shows that the value of\nthe expression to the left of the sign (the left hand side or LHS) is equal to\nthe value of the expression to the right of the sign (the right hand side or RHS). In\nequation (4.1),  the LHS is (4 x + 5) and the RHS is 65. In equation (4.2), the LHS is\n(10y – 20) and the RHS is 50.\nIf there is some sign other than the equality sign between the LHS and the RHS, it is\nnot an equation. Thus, 4 x + 5 > 65 is not an equation.\nIt says that, the value of (4 x + 5) is greater than 65.\nSimilarly ,  4x + 5 < 65 is not an equation. It says that the value of (4 x + 5) is smaller\nthan 65.\nIn equations, we often find that the RHS is just a number . In Equation (4.1), it is 65\nand in equation (4.2), it is 50. But this need not be always so. The RHS of an equation may\nbe an expression containing the variable. For example, the equation\n4x + 5 = 6\nx – 25\nhas the expression (4 x + 5) on the left and (6 x – 25) on the right of the equality sign.\nIn short, an equation is a condition on a variable. The condition is that two\nexpressions should have equal value. Note that at least one of the two expr essions\nmust contain the variable.\nWe also note a simple and useful property of equations. The equation 4 x +5 = 65 is\nthe same as 65 = 4 x + 5. Similarly , the equation 6 x – 25 = 4 x +5 is the same as\n4x + 5 = 6x – 25. An equation r emains the same, when the expr ession s on the left\nand on the right ar e inter changed. This property is often useful in solving equations.\nEXAMPLE  1 Write the following statements in the form of equations:\n(i)The sum of three times x and 1 1 is 32.\n(ii)If you subtract 5 from 6 times a number , you get 7.\n(iii) One fourth of m is 3 more than 7.\n(iv) One third of a number plus 5 is 8.\nSOLUTION\n(i)Three times x is 3x.\nSum of 3 x and 1 1 is 3 x + 11.

Specificially , suppose we add dif ferent\nnumbers, to the two sides of an equality . We shall find in this case that the equality does not\n2024-25\n\nSIMPLE EQU ATIONS 65\nhold (i.e., it s both sides are not equal). For example, let us take again equality (4.5),\n8 – 3 = 4 + 1\nadd 2 to the LHS and 3 to the RHS. The new LHS is 8 – 3 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 and the new\nRHS is 4 + 1 + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8. The equality does not hold, because the new LHS and RHS\nare not equal.\nThus if we fail to do the same mathematical operation with same number on\nboth sides of an equality , the equality may not hold.\nThe equality that involves variables is an equation.\nThese conclusions are also valid for equations, as in each equation variable\nrepresents a number  only .\nOften an equation is said to be like a weighing balance. Doing a mathematical operation\non an equation is like adding weights to or removing weights from the pans of a weighing\nbalance.\nAn equation is like a weighing balance with equal weights on\nboth its pans, in which case the arm of the balance is exactly\nhorizontal. If we add the same weights to both the pans, the arm\nremains horizontal. Similarly , if we remove the same weights from\nboth the pans, the arm remains horizontal. On the other hand if we\nadd different weights to the pans or remove different weights from\nthem, the balance is tilted; that is, the arm of the balance does not\nremain horizontal.\nWe use this principle for solving an equation. Here , ofcourse ,\nthe balance is imaginary and numbers can be used as weights that can be physically\nbalanced against each other . This is the real purpose in presenting the principle. Let us\ntake some examples.\n/circle6Consider the equation:     x + 3 = 8 (4.6)\nWe shall subtract 3 from both sides of this equation.\nThe new LHS is x + 3 – 3 = xand the new RHS is 8 – 3 = 5\nSince this does not disturb the balance, we have\nNew LHS = New RHS or x = 5\nwhich is exactly what we want, the solution of the equation (4.6).A balanced equation is like a\nweighing balance with equal weights\nin the two pans.L.H.S. R.H.S.\nWhy should we subtract 3,\nand not some other\nnumber? T ry adding 3.\nWill it help? Why not?\nIt is because subtracting 3\nreduces the LHS to x.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 66\nTo confirm whether we are right, we shall put x = 5 in the original equation. We get\nLHS = x + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8, which is equal to the RHS as required.\nBy doing the right mathematical operation (i.e., subtracting 3) on both the sides of the\nequation, we arrived at the solution of the equation.\n/circle6Let us look at another equation x – 3 = 10 (4.7)\nWhat should we do here? We should add 3 to both the sides, By doing so, we shall\nretain the balance and also the LHS will reduce to just x.\nNew LHS = \nx – 3 + 3 =  x  ,   New RHS = 10 + 3 = 13\nTherefore, x = 13,  which is the required solution.\nBy putting x = 13 in the original equation (4.7) we confirm that\nthe solution is correct:\nLHS of original equation = x – 3 = 13 – 3 = 10\nThis is equal to the RHS as required.\n/circle6Similarly , let us look at the equations\n5y =35 (4.8)\nm\n2 =5  (4.9)\nIn the first case, we shall divide both the sides by 5. This will give us just y on LHS\nNew LHS = 5\n55\n5y yy =×=, New RHS = 35\n55 7\n57 =×=\nTherefore, y =7\nThis is the required solution. We can substitute y = 7 in Eq. (4.8) and check that it is\nsatisfied.\nIn the second case, we shall multiply both sides by 2. This will give us just m on the\nLHS\nThe new LHS =  m\n22× = m. The new RHS = 5 × 2 = 10.\nHence, m = 10 (It is the required solution. You can check whether the solution is correct).\nOne can see that in the above examples, the operation we need to perform depends\non the equation. Our attempt should be to get the variable in the equation separated.\nSometimes, for doing so we may have to carry out more than one mathematical operation.\nLet us solve some more equations with this in mind.\nEXAMPLE  5Solve: (a)3n\n + 7 = 25 (4.10)\n(b) 2p – 1 = 23 (4.11)\nSOLUTION\n(a)We go stepwise to separate the variable n on the LHS of the equation. The LHS is\n3n + 7. We shall first subtract 7 from it so that we get 3 n. From this, in the next step\nwe shall divide by 3 to get n. Remember we must do the same operation on both\nsides of the equation. Therefore, subtracting 7 from both sides,\n3n + 7 – 7 = 25 – 7 (Step 1)\nor 3n = 18\n2024-25\n\nSIMPLE EQU ATIONS 67\nNow divide both sides by 3,\n3\n3n =18\n3(Step 2)\nor n =6, which is the solution.\n(b)What should we do here? First we shall add 1 to both the sides:\n2\np – 1 + 1 = 23 + 1 (Step 1)\nor 2p = 24\nNow divide both sides by 2, we get 2\n224\n2p= (Step 2)\nor p =12, which is the solution.\nOne good practice you should develop is to check the solution you have obtained.\nAlthough we have not done this for (a) above, let us do it for this example.\nLet us put the solution p = 12 back into the equation.\nLHS = 2p\n – 1 = 2 × 12 – 1 = 24 – 1\n=23 = RHS\nThe solution is thus checked for its correctness.\nWhy do you not check the solution of (a) also?\nWe are now in a position to go back to the mind-reading game presented by Appu,\nSarita, and Ameena and understand how they got their answers. For this purpose, let us\nlook at the equations (4.1) and (4.2) which correspond respectively to Ameena’ s and\nAppu’ s examples.\n/circle6First consider the equation 4 x + 5 = 65. (4.1)\nSubtracting 5 from both sides,  4x  + 5 – 5 = 65 – 5.\ni.e. 4x =60\nDivide both sides by 4; this will separate x. We get 4\n4x = 60\n4\nor x =15, which is the solution. (Check, if it is correct.)\n/circle6Now consider ,10y – 20 = 50 (4.2)\nAdding 20 to both sides, we get 10\ny – 20 + 20 = 50 + 20  or  10 y = 70\nDividing both sides by 10, we get10\n10y =  70\n10\nor y =7, which is the solution. (Check if it is correct.)\nYou will realise that exactly these were the answers given by Appu, Sarita and Ameena.\nThey had learnt to set up equations and solve them. That is why they could construct their\nmind reader game and impress the whole class.

While solving these equations, we shall learn\nabout transposing a number , i.e., moving it from one side to the other . We can transpose a\nnumber instead of adding or subtracting it from both sides of the equation.\nEXAMPLE  6  Solve:  12p – 5  = 25 (4.12)\nSOLUTION\n/circle6Adding 5 on both sides of the equation,\n12p – 5 + 5 = 25 + 5 or 12p = 30\n/circle6Dividing both sides by 12,\n12\n1230\n12p= or p = 5\n2\nCheck   Putting p = 5\n2 in the LHS of equation 4.12,\nLHS =512 – 52×  = 6 × 5 – 5\n=30 – 5 = 25 = RHS\nNote, adding 5 to both sides\nis the same as changing side\nof (– 5).\n12\np – 5 = 25\n12p = 25 + 5\nChanging side is called\ntransposing . While trans-\nposing a number , we change\nits sign.\n2024-25\n\nSIMPLE EQU ATIONS 69\nAs we have seen, while solving equations one commonly used operation is adding or\nsubtracting the same number on both sides of the equation. Transposing a number\n(i.e., changing the side of the number) is the same as adding or subtracting the number\nfrom both sides.  In doing so, the sign of the number has to be changed. What applies to\nnumbers also applies t o expressions. Let us take two more examples of transposing.\nAdding or Subtracting Transposing\non both sides\n(i)3p\n – 10 = 5 (i)3p – 10 = 5\nAdd 10 to both sides Transpose (–10) from LHS to RHS\n3p – 10 + 10 = 5 + 10 (On transposing – 10 becomes + 10).\nor3p = 15 3p = 5 + 10   or   3 p = 15\n(ii)5x + 12 = 27 (ii)5x + 12 = 27\nSubtract 12 from both sides Transposing  + 12\n(On transposing + 12 becomes – 12)\n5x + 12 – 12 = 27 – 12 5x = 27 – 12\nor5x = 15 or 5x = 15\nWe shall now solve two more equations.

That is,  3 x + 11 = 32\n/circle6To solve this equation, we transpose 1 1 to RHS, so that\n3\nx = 32 – 1 1    or     3x  = 21\nNow, divide both sides by 3\nSo x =21\n3 = 7\nThe required number is 7.

Transposition of a number has the same\neffect as adding same number to (or subtracting the same number from) both sides of\nthe equation. When you transpose a number from one side of the equation to the\nother side, you change its sign. For example, transposing +3 from the LHS to the\nRHS in equation x + 3 = 8 gives x = 8 – 3 (= 5). We can carry out the transposition\nof an expression in the same way as the transposition of a number .\n7.We also learnt how , using the technique of doing the same mathematical operation\n(for  example adding the same number) on both sides, we could build an equation\nstarting from its  solution. Further , we also learnt that we could relate a given equation\nto some appropriate  practical situation and build a practical word problem/puzzle\nfrom the equation.\n2024-25\n"}

In Fig 5.1,\nobserve the corners. These corners are formed when two lines or line segments intersect\nat a point. For example, look at the figures given below:\nFig 5.3\nIn Fig 5.3 (i) line segments AB and BC intersect at B to form angle\nABC, and again line segments BC and AC intersect at C to form angle\nACB and so on. Whereas, in Fig 5.3 (ii) lines PQ and RS intersect at O\nto form four angles POS, SOQ, QOR and ROP . An angle ABC is\nrepresented by the symbol ∠ABC. Thus, in Fig 5.3 (i), the three angles\nformed are ∠ABC, ∠BCA and ∠BAC, and in Fig 5.3 (ii), the four\nangles formed are ∠POS, ∠SOQ, ∠QOR and ∠POR. You have already\nstudied how to classify the angles as acute, obtuse or right angle.\nNote: While referring to the measure of an angle ABC, we shall write m ∠ABC as simply\n∠ABC.

Can\nyou say , ‘why’?\n2024-25\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 81\n5.3.3. Angles made by a T ransversal\nIn Fig 5.13, you see lines l and m cut by transversal p. The eight\nangles marked 1 to 8 have their special names:\nInterior angles ∠3, ∠4, ∠5, ∠6\nExterior angles ∠1, ∠2, ∠7, ∠8\nPairs of Corresponding angles ∠1 and  ∠5, ∠2 and  ∠6,\n∠3 and  ∠7, ∠4 and ∠8\nPairs of Alternate interior angles ∠3 and ∠6, ∠4 and ∠5\nPairs of Alternate exterior angles ∠1 and ∠8, ∠2 and ∠7\nPairs of interior angles on the ∠3 and ∠5, ∠4 and ∠6\nsame side of the transversal\nNote: Corresponding angles (like ∠1 and ∠5 in Fig 5.14) include\n (i)different vertices (ii)are on the same side of the transversal and\n(iii) are in ‘corresponding’  positions (above or below , left or right) relative to the\ntwo lines.Fig 5.13TRY THESE\n1.Suppose two lines are given.\nHow many transversals can you\ndraw for these lines?\n2.If a line is a transversal to three\nlines, how many points of\nintersections are there?\n3.Try to identify a few transversals\nin your surroundings.\nFig 5.14\nAlternate interior angles (like ∠3 and ∠6 in Fig 5.15)\n(i)have different vertices\n(ii)are on opposite sides of the transversal and\n(iii) lie ‘between’ the two lines.Fig 5.15\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 82\nTake a ruled sheet of paper .

Trace the lines l, m and t.\nSlide the tracing paper along t, until l coincides with m.\nYou find that ∠1 on the traced figure coincides with ∠2 of the original figure.\nIn fact, you can see all the following results by similar tracing and sliding activity .\n(i)   ∠1 =  ∠2 (ii)   ∠3 =  ∠ 4 (iii)   ∠5 =  ∠6 (iv)   ∠7 =  ∠8DO THIS\nTRY THESE\nName the pairs of angles in each figure:\nTransversals of parallel lines give rise to quite interesting results.\nFig 5.165.3.4 T ransversal of Parallel Lines\nDo you remember what parallel lines are? They are lines on a plane that do not meet\nanywhere. Can you identify parallel lines in the following figures? (Fig 5.16)\n2024-25\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 83\nFig 5.18This activity illustrates the following fact:\nIf two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each pair of corresponding angles are\nequal in measure.\nWe use this result to get another interesting result. Look at Fig 5. 18.\nWhen t cuts the parallel lines, l, m, we get, ∠ 3 = ∠7 (vertically opposite angles) .\nBut ∠7 = ∠8 (corresponding angles). Therefore,  ∠3 = ∠8\nYou can similarly show that ∠1 = ∠6. Thus, we\nhave the following result :\nIf two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each\npair of alternate interior angles are equal.\nThis second result leads to another interesting\nproperty . Again, from Fig 5.18.(i) (ii)\nFig 5.17 (iii) (iv)\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 84\n∠3 + ∠1 = 180° ( ∠3 and ∠1 form a linear pair)\nBut ∠1 = ∠6 (A pair of alternate interior angles)\nTherefore,   we can say that ∠3 + ∠6 = 180°.\nSimilarly ,  ∠1 + ∠8 = 180°. Thus, we obtain the following result:\nIf two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then each pair of interior angles on the same\nside of the transversal are supplementary .\nYou can very easily remember these results if you can look for relevant ‘shapes’.\nThe F-shape stands for corresponding angles:\nDO THISThe Z - shape stands for alternate angles.\nDraw a pair of parallel lines and a transversal. Verify the above three statements by actually measuring\nthe angles.\n2024-25\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 85\nTRY THESE\nFig 5.19\nFig 5.205.4  C HECKING  FOR PARALLEL  LINES\nIf two lines are parallel, then you know that a transversal gives rise to\npairs of equal corresponding angles, equal alternate interior angles\nand interior angles on the same side of the transversal being\nsupplementary .\nWhen two lines are given, is there any method to check if they are\nparallel or not? You need this skill in many life-oriented situations.\nA draftsman uses a carpenter ’s square and a straight edge (ruler)\nto draw these segments (Fig 5.19). He claims they are parallel. How?\nAre you able to see that he has kept the corresponding angles to\nbe equal? (What is the transversal here?)\nThus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of\ncorresponding angles ar e equal, then the lines have to be parallel .\nLook at the letter Z(Fig 5.20). The horizontal segments here are\nparallel, because the alternate angles are equal.\nWhen a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of alternate\ninterior angles ar e equal, the lines have to b e parallel .Lines l || m; Lines a || b; l1, l2 be two lines\nt is a transversal c is a transversal t is a transversal\n∠ x = ? ∠ y = ?

Again draw a line p,\nsuch that p is perpendicular to m.\nThus, p is perpendicular to a perpendicular to l.\nYou find p || l. How? This is because you draw p such\nthat ∠1 + ∠2 = 180o.\nThus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of interior angles on the\nsame side of the transversal ar e supplementar y, the lines have to be parallel .\nEXERCISE  5.2\n1.State the property that is used in each of the\nfollowing statements?\n(i)If  a || b, then ∠1 = ∠5.\n(ii)If ∠4 = ∠6, then a || b\n.\n(iii) If ∠4 + ∠5 = 180°, then a || b.\n2.In the adjoining figure, identify\n(i)the pairs of corresponding angles.\n(ii)the pairs of alternate interior angles.\n(iii) the pairs of interior angles on the same\nside of the transversal.\n(iv) the vertically opposite angles.\n3.In the adjoining figure, p || q.

The line XM through X is now the axis of symmetry (which\nyou will read in Chapter 14). You find that  ∠Y and  ∠Z fit on each other exactly . XY and\nXZ are called equal sides;  YZ is called the base; ∠Y and  ∠Z are called base angles and\nthese are also equal.\nThus, in an isosceles triangle:\n(i)two sides have same length.\n(ii)base angles opposite to the equal sides are equal.\n1.Find angle x in each figure:TRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 99\n2.Find angles x and y in each figure.\n6.7  SUM OF THE LENGTHS  OF TWO SIDES OF A TRIANGLE\n1. Mark three non-collinear spots A, B and C in your playground. Using lime powder\nmark the paths AB, BC and AC.\nAsk your friend to start from A and reach C, walking along one or more\nof these paths. She can, for example, walk first along AB and then\nalong BC to reach C; or she can walk straight along AC. She will\nnaturally prefer the direct path AC. If she takes the other path  ( ABand\nthen BC), she will have to walk more. In other words,\nAB + BC > AC (i)\nSimilarly , if one were to start from B and go to A, he or she will not take the route\nBC and CA but will prefer BA This is because\nBC + CA > AB (ii)\nBy a similar argument, you find that\nCA + AB > BC (iii)\nThese observations suggest that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a\ntriangle is greater than the third side .\n2. Collect fifteen small sticks (or strips) of dif ferent lengths, say , 6 cm, 7 cm, 8 cm,\n9 cm, ..., 20 cm.\nTake any three of these sticks and try to form a triangle. Repeat this by choosing\ndifferent combinations of three sticks.\nSuppose you first choose two sticks of length 6 cm and 12 cm. Your third stick has to\nbe of length more than 12 – 6 = 6 cm and less than 12 + 6 = 18 cm. Try this and find\nout why it is so.\nTo form a triangle you will need any three sticks such that the sum of the lengths of\nany two of them will always be greater than the length of the third stick.\nThis also suggests that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater\nthan the third side.Fig 6.21\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 100\n3.Draw any three triangles, say ∆ABC, ∆PQR and ∆XYZ in your notebook\n(Fig 6.22).\n(i) (ii) (iii)\n              Fig 6.22\nUse your ruler to find the lengths of their sides and then tabulate your results as follows:\nName of ∆∆∆\n∆∆ Lengths of Sides Is this True?\n∆ ABC AB ___ AB – BC < CA (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nBC ___ BC –  CA   <  AB (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nCA  ___ CA – AB < BC (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\n∆ PQR PQ ___ PQ  – QR < RP (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nQR ___ QR –  RP < PQ (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nRP ___ RP – PQ < QR (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\n∆ XYZ XY ___ XY – YZ < ZX (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nYZ  ___ YZ – ZX < XY (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nZX ___ ZX – XY  < YZ (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nThis also strengthens our earlier guess. Therefore, we conclude that sum of the lengths\nof any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.\nWe also find that the dif ference between the length of any two sides of a triangle is\nsmaller than the length of the third side.A\nB CR\nPQ\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 101\nEXAMPLE  3Is there a triangle whose sides have lengths 10.2 cm, 5.8 cm and 4.5 cm?\nSOLUTION Suppose such a triangle is possible. Then the sum of the lengths of any two\nsides would be greater than the length of the third side. Let us check this.\n                                 Is 4.5 + 5.8 > 10.2? Yes\n      Is 5.8 + 10.2 > 4.5? Yes\nIs 10.2 + 4.5 > 5.8? Yes\nTherefore, the triangle is possible.\nEXAMPLE  4The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 6 cm and 8 cm. Between which\ntwo numbers can length of the third side fall?\nSOLUTION We know that the sum of two sides of a triangle is always greater than\nthe third.\nTherefore, third side has to be less than the sum of the two sides. The third side is thus,\nless than 8 + 6 = 14 cm.\nThe side cannot be less than the difference of the two sides. Thus, the third side has to\nbe more than 8 – 6 = 2 cm.\nThe length of the third side could be any length greater than 2 and less than 14 cm.\nEXERCISE  6.4\n1.Is it possible to have a triangle with the following sides?\n(i)2 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm (ii)3 cm, 6 cm, 7 cm\n(iii) 6 cm, 3 cm, 2 cm\n2.Take any point O in the interior of a triangle PQR.

In fact, this\nproperty was known to people of many other\ncountries too. The Indian mathematician Baudhayan\nhas also given an equivalent form of this property .\nWe now try to explain the Pythagoras property .\nIn a right-angled triangle, the sides have some\nspecial names. The side opposite to the right angle\nis called the hypotenuse ; the other two sides are\nknown as the legs of the right-angled triangle.\nIn \n∆ABC (Fig 6.23), the right-angle is at B. So,\nAC is the hypotenuse. AB and BC are the legs of\n∆ABC.\nMake eight identical copies of right angled\ntriangle of any size you prefer . For example, you\nmake a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse is a\nunits long and the legs are of lengths b\n units and\nc units (Fig 6.24).\nDraw two identical squares on a sheet with sides\nof lengths b + c.\nYou are to place four triangles in one square and the remaining four triangles in the\nother square, as shown in the following diagram (Fig 6.25).\nFig 6.23\nFig 6.24\nFig 6.25Square A Square B\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 103\nThe squares are identical; the eight triangles inserted are also identical.\nHence the uncovered area of square A = Uncovered area of square B.\ni.e., Area of inner square of square A = The total area of two uncovered squares in square B.\na2 =b2 + c2\nThis is Pythagoras property . It may be stated as follows:\nIn a right-angled triangle,\nthe square on the hypotenuse = sum of the squares on the legs.\nPythagoras property is a very useful tool in mathematics. It is formally proved as a\ntheorem in later classes. You should be clear about its meaning.\nIt says that for any right-angled triangle, the area of the square on the hypotenuse is\nequal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the legs.\nDraw a right triangle, preferably on\na square sheet, construct squares on\nits sides, compute the area of these\nsquares and verify the theorem\npractically (Fig 6.26).\nIf you have a right-angled triangle,\nthe Pythagoras property holds. If the\nPythagoras property holds for some\ntriangle, will the triangle be right-\nangled? (Such problems are known as\nconverse problems). We will try to\nanswer this. Now , we will show that,\nif there is a triangle such that sum of\nthe squares on two of its sides is equal\nto the square of the third side, it must\nbe a right-angled triangle.Fig 6.26\nDO THIS\n5262\n4256\n4\nFig 6.27\n1.Have cut-outs of squares with sides 4 cm,\n5 cm, 6 cm long. Arrange to get a triangular\nshape by placing the corners of the squares\nsuitably as shown in the figure (Fig 6.27).\nTrace out the triangle formed. Measure each\nangle of the triangle. You find that there is no\nright angle at all.\nIn fact, in this case each angle will be acute! Note\nthat 42 + 52 ≠ 62, 52 + 62 ≠ 42 and 62 + 42 ≠ 52.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 104\n2.Repeat the above activity with squares whose sides have lengths 4 cm, 5 cm and\n7 cm. You get an obtuse-angled triangle! Note that\n42 + 52 ≠72 etc.\nThis shows that Pythagoras property holds if and only if the triangle is right-angled.\nHence we get this fact:\nIf  the Pythagoras property holds, the triangle must be right-angled.\nEXAMPLE  5Determine whether the triangle whose lengths of sides are 3 cm, 4 cm,\n5 cm is a right-angled triangle.\nSOLUTION 32 = 3 × 3 = 9; 42 = 4 × 4 = 16; 52 = 5 × 5 = 25\nWe find 32 + 42 = 52.\nTherefore, the triangle is right-angled.\nNote: In any right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse happens to be the longest side. In this\nexample, the side with length 5 cm is the hypotenuse.\nEXAMPLE  6 ∆ ABC is right-angled at C. If\nAC = 5 cm and BC = 12 cm find\nthe length of AB.\nSOLUTION A rough figure will help us (Fig 6.28).\nBy Pythagoras property ,\nAB2 =AC2 + BC2\n= 52 + 122  = 25 + 144 = 169 = 132\nor AB2 =132.  So,   AB = 13\nor the length of AB is 13 cm.\nNote: To identify perfect squares, you may use prime factorisation technique.Fig 6.28\nTRY THESE\nFind the unknown length x in the following figures (Fig 6.29):\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 105\nEXERCISE  6.5\n1.PQR is a triangle, right-angled at P .

That is 1% means\n1 out of hundred or one hundredth. It can be written as:  1% = 1\n100 = 0.01\nTo understand this, let us consider the following example.\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 109\nRina made a table top of 100 dif ferent coloured tiles.

For example, Rina had 100\ntiles in all, there were 100 children and 100 shoe pairs. How do we calculate Percentage\nof an item if the total number of items do not add up to 100? In such cases, we need to\nconvert the fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 100. Consider the following\nexample.

We have also learnt to convert\nfractional numbers and decimals to percentages. Now , we shall learn how percentages\ncan be used in real life. For this, we start with interpreting the following statements:\n—5% of the income is saved by Ravi. — 2 0% of Meera’ s dresses are blue in colour .\n—Rekha gets 1 0% on every book sold by her .\nWhat can you infer from each of these statements?\nBy 5% we mean 5 parts out of 100 or we write it as 5\n100. It means Ravi is saving\n` 5 out of every ` 100 that he earns. In the same way , interpret the rest of the statements\ngiven above.\n7.2.2  Converting Percentages to “How Many”\nConsider the following examples:\nEXAMPLE  6A survey of 40 children showed that 25% liked playing football.

Consider the following example:\nEXAMPLE  8Reena’ s mother said, to make idlis, you must take two parts rice and\none part urad dal . What percentage of such a mixture would be rice\nand what percentage would be urad dal ?\nSOLUTION In terms of ratio we would write this as Rice : Urad dal  = 2 : 1.\nNow, 2 + 1=3 is the total of all parts. This means rd2\n3 part is rice and rd1\n3 part is urad dal .\nThen, percentage of rice would be 2\n3100200\n3662\n3× = = % % .\nPercentage of urad dal  would be 1 100 1100 % 33 %3 3 3× = = .(i) (ii) (iii)\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 117\nEXAMPLE  9If ` 250 is to be divided amongst Ravi, Raju and Roy , so that Ravi gets\ntwo parts, Raju three parts and Roy five parts.

For example, if the population of a state increased from 5,50,000 to\n6,05,000. Then the increase in population can be understood better if we say , the\npopulation increased by 10 %.\nHow do we convert the increase or decrease in a quantity as a percentage of the initial\namount? Consider the following example.\nEXAMPLE  10A school team won 6 games this year against 4 games won last year .\nWhat is the per cent increase?\nSOLUTION The increase in the number of wins (or amount of change) = 6 – 4 = 2.\nPercentage increase =amount of change\noriginal amount or base× 100\n=increase in the number of wins×100original number of wins = 2\n4× 100 = 50\nEXAMPLE  11The number of illiterate persons in a country decreased from 150 lakhs\nto 100 lakhs in 10 years.

It is ` 52 per litre today . By\nwhat Percentage has the price gone up?\n7.3  PRICES RELATED  TO AN ITEM OR BUYING AND SELLING\nI bought it for ` 600\n    and will sell it for ` 610\nThe buying price of any it em is known as its cost price . It is written in short as CP .\nThe price at which you sell is known as the selling price  or in short SP .\nWhat would you say is better , to you sell the item at a lower price, same price or higher\nprice than your buying price? You can decide whether the sale was profitable or not\ndepending on the CP  and SP . If CP  < SP   then you made a profit = SP  – CP .\nIf CP = SP  then you are in a no profit no loss situation.\nIf CP  > SP   then you have a loss = CP  – SP .\nLet us try to interpret the statements related to prices of items.\n/circle6  A toy bought for ` 72 is sold at \n` 80.\n/circle6  A T-shirt bought for ` 120 is sold at ` 100.\n/circle6  A cycle bought for ` 800 is sold for ` 940.\nLet us consider the first statement.\nThe buying price (or CP) is ` 72 and the selling price (or SP) is ` 80. This means SP\nis more than CP . Hence profit made  = SP  – CP   = ` 80 – ` 72 = ` 8\nNow try interpreting the remaining statements in a similar way .\n7.3.1  Profit or Loss as a Percentage\nThe profit or loss can be converted to a percentage. It is always calculated on the CP .\nFor the above examples, we can find the profit % or loss %.\nLet us consider the example related to the toy . We have CP  = ` 72, SP  = ` 80,\nProfit = ` 8. To find the percentage of profit, Neha and Shekhar have used the\nfollowing methods.TRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 119\nThus, the profit is ` 8 and\nprofit Per cent is 1119.\nThus, by both methods we get the SP as\n` 108.On ` 120, the loss is ` 20\nSo on ` 100, the lossNeha does it this way Shekhar does it this way\nProfit per cent =Profit\nCP× 100 = 8\n72×100 On ` 72 the profit is ` 8\n                               = 1\n9100×  = 111\n9On ` 100,  profit = 8\n72×100\n = 111\n9. Thus, profit per cent = 1119\nSimilarly you can find the loss per cent in the second situation. Here,\nCP = ` 120, SP = ` 100.\nTherefore,  Loss = ` 120 – ` 100 = ` 20\n Loss per cent =Loss×100CP\n=20×100120= × = =20\n12010050\n3162\n3\n=50 2163 3= Thus, loss per cent is 2163\nTry the last case.\nNow we see that given any two out of the three quantities related to prices that is, CP ,\nSP, amount of Profit or Loss or their percentage, we can find the rest.\nEXAMPLE  12The cost of a flower vase is ` 120. If the shopkeeper sells it at a loss\nof 10%, find the price at which it is sold.\nSOLUTION We are given that CP  = ` 120 and Loss per cent = 10. We have to find\nthe SP .\nSohan does it like this Anandi does it like this\nLoss of 10% means if  CP is ` 100, Loss is 10% of the cost price\nLoss is ` 10 =10% of ` 120\nTherefore, SP would be =10120100×  = ` 12\n` (100 – 10) = ` 90  Therefore\nWhen CP is \n` 100, SP is ` 90. SP = CP – Loss\nTherefore, if CP were  ` 120 then =` 120 – ` 12 = ` 108\nSP = 90120100×  = ` 108\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 120\nEXAMPLE  13   Selling price of a toy car is ` 540. If the profit made by shopkeeper is\n20%, what is the cost price of  this toy?\nSOLUTION We are given that SP  = ` 540 and the  Profit = 20%. We need to find the CP .\nAmina does it like this Arun does it like this\n20% profit will mean if CP is ` 100, Profit = 20% of CP and SP = CP + Profit\nprofit is ` 20 So, 540 = CP + 20% of CP\n= CP + 20\n100 × CP = 11 CP5 +  \n= 6CP5.  Therefore,   5540 CP6× =\nor  ` 450 = CP\nThus, by both methods, the cost price is ` 450.\n 1.A shopkeeper bought a chair for ` 375 and sold it for ` 400.

Sohini said her father was going to\ntake a loan from a bank. The money you borrow is known as sum borrowed\nor principal .\nThis money would be used by the borrower for some time before it is\nreturned. For keeping this money for some time the borrower has to pay some\nextra money to the bank. This is known as Interest.\nYou can find the amount you have to pay at the end of the year by adding\nthe sum borrowed and the interest. That is, Amount = Principal + Inter est.\nInterest is generally given in per cent for a period of one year . It is written\nas  say 10% per year or per annum or in short as 10% p.a. (per annum).\n10% p.a. means on every ` 100 borrowed, ` 10 is the interest you have to pay for one\nyear. Let us take an example and see how this works.\nEXAMPLE  14Anita takes a loan of ` 5,000 at 15% per year as rate of interest. Find\nthe interest she has to pay at  the end of one year .Therefore, SP = 100 + 20  = 120\nNow , when SP  is ` 120,\nthen CP is ` 100.\nTherefore, when SP is ` 540,\nthen CP = 100540120×  = ` 450\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 121\nSOLUTION The sum borrowed = ` 5,000, Rate of interest = 15% per year .\nThis means if ` 100 is borrowed, she has to pay ` 15 as interest for one year . If she has\nborrowed ` 5,000, then the interest she has to pay for one year\n= ` 155000100×  = ` 750\nSo,  at the end of the year she has to give an amount of  ` 5,000 + ` 750 =  ` 5,750.\nWe can write a general relation to find interest for one year . Take P as the principal or\nsum and R % as Rate per cent per annum.\nNow on every ` 100 borrowed, the interest paid is ` R\nTherefore,  on ` P borrowed, the interest paid for one year would be 100R P× = P R×\n100.\n7.4.1  Inter est for Multiple Y ears\nIf the amount is borrowed for more than one year the interest is calculated for the period\nthe money is kept for . For example, if Anita returns the money at the end of two years and\nthe rate of interest is the same then she would have to pay twice the interest i.e., ` 750 for\nthe first year and ` 750 for the second. This way of calculating interest where principal is\nnot changed is known as simple inter est. As the number of years increase the interest\nalso increases. For ` 100 borrowed for 3 years at 18%, the interest to be paid at the end\nof 3 years is 18 + 18 + 18 = 3 × 18 = ` 54.\nWe can find the general form for simple interest for more than one year .\nWe know that on a principal of `\n P at R% rate of interest per year , the interest paid for\none year is R P×\n100. Therefore, interest I paid for T years would be\nT R P P R T PRT× ×=× ×\n100 100 100or\nAnd amount you have to pay at the end of T years is A = P + I\n 1.` 10,000 is invested at 5% interest rate p.a.

The\nnumbers used for this purpose were called counting numbers or natural\nnumbers. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, ... By including 0 to natural numbers, we\ngot the whole numbers, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, ... The negatives of natural\nnumbers were then put together with whole numbers to make up\nintegers. Integers are ..., –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .... We, thus, extended\nthe number system, from natural numbers to whole numbers and from\nwhole numbers to integers.\nYou were also introduced to fractions. These are numbers of the form numerator\ndenominator,\nwhere the numerator is either 0 or a positive integer and the denominator , a positive integer .\nYou compared two fractions, found their equivalent forms and studied all the four basic\noperations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them.\nIn this Chapter , we shall extend  the number system further . We shall introduce the concept\nof rational numbers alongwith their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.\n8.2  N EED FOR RATIONAL  NUMBERS\nEarlier , we have seen how integers could be used to denote opposite situations involving\nnumbers. For example, if the distance of 3 km to the right of a place was denoted by 3, then\nthe distance of 5 km to the left of the same place could be denoted by –5. If a profit of ` 150\nwas represented by 150 then a loss of ` 100 could be written as –100.\nThere are many situations similar to the above situations that involve fractional numbers.\nYou can represent a distance of 750m above sea level as 3\n4 km. Can we represent 750m\nbelow sea level in km? Can we denote the distance of 3\n4 km below sea level by 3\n4−? We can\nsee 3\n4− is neither an integer , nor a fractional number . We need to extend our number system\nto include such numbers.\nChapter  8\n2024-25\n\nRATIONAL NUMBERS 125\n8.3  W HAT ARE RATIONAL  NUMBERS ?\nThe word ‘rational’  arises from the term ‘ratio’. You know that a ratio like 3:2 can also be\nwritten as 3\n2. Here, 3 and 2 are natural numbers.\nSimilarly , the ratio of two integers p and q (q ≠ 0), i.e., p:q can be written in the form\np\nq. This is the form in which rational numbers are expressed.\nA rational number is defined as a number that can be expr essed in the\nform p\nq, wher e p and q ar e integers and q ≠  0.\nThus, 4\n5 is a rational number . Here, p = 4 and q = 5.\nIs 3\n4− also a rational number? Yes, because p = – 3 and q = 4 are integers.\n/circle6You have seen many fractions like 3\n84\n812\n3, ,  etc. All fractions are rational\nnumbers. Can you say why?\nHow about the decimal numbers like 0.5, 2.3, etc.? Each of such numbers can be\nwritten as an ordinary fraction and, hence, are rational numbers. For example, 0.5 = 5\n10,\n0.333 = 333\n1000 etc.\n1.Is the number 2\n3− rational? Think about it. 2.List ten rational numbers.\nNumerator and Denominator\nIn p\nq, the integer p is the numerator , and the integer q (≠ 0) is the denominator .\nThus, in 3\n7−, the numerator is –3 and the denominator is 7.\nMention five rational numbers each of whose\n(a)Numerator is a negative integer and denominator is a positive integer .\n(b)Numerator is a positive integer and denominator is a negative integer .\n(c)Numerator and denominator both are negative integers.\n(d)Numerator and denominator both are positive integers.\n/circle6Are integers also rational numbers?\nAny integer can be thought of as a rational number . For example, the integer –5 is a\nrational number , because you can write it as 5\n1−. The integer 0 can also be written as\n00\n20\n7=or etc. Hence, it is also a rational number .\nThus, rational numbers include integers and fractions.\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 126\nEquivalent rational numbers\nA rational number can be written with different numerators and denominators. For example,\nconsider the rational number – 2\n3.\n– 2\n3 =–2 2 – 4\n3 2 6×=×. We see that – 2\n3 is the same as – 4\n6.\nAlso,–2\n3 =()()\n( )–2 –5 10\n3 –5 –15×=×. So, – 2\n3 is also the same as 10\n15−.\nThus, – 2\n3 = 4\n6−\n =10\n15−. Such rational numbers that are equal to each other are said to\nbe equivalent to each other .\nAgain,10\n15− =−10\n15 (How?)\nBy multiplying the numerator and denominator of a rational\nnumber by the same non zer o integer , we obtain another rational\nnumber equivalent to the given rational number . This is exactly like\nobtaining equivalent fractions.\nJust as multiplication, the division of the numerator and denominator\nby the same non zero integer , also gives equivalent rational numbers. For\nexample,\n10\n–15 = ()\n( )10 –5 –2\n–15 –5 3÷=÷,     –12\n24 = 12 12 1\n24 12 2− ÷ −=÷\nWe write –2\n3as –2\n3, –10\n15as –10\n15, etc.\n8.4  P OSITIVE  AND NEGATIVE  RATIONAL  NUMBERS\nConsider the rational number 2\n3. Both the numerator and denominator of this number are\npositive integers. Such a rational number is called a positive rational number . So, 3\n85\n72\n9, ,\netc. are positive rational numbers.\nThe numerator of –3\n5 is a negative integer , whereas the denominator\nis a positive integer .

Let us draw one such number line.\nThe points to the right of 0 are denoted by + sign and are positive integers. The points\nto the left of 0 are denoted by – sign and are negative integers.\nRepresentation of fractions on a number line is also known to you.\nLet us see how the rational numbers can be represented on a number line.\nLet us represent the number −1\n2 on the number line.\nAs done in the case of positive integers, the positive rational numbers would be marked\non the right of 0 and the negative rational numbers would be marked on the left of 0.\nTo which side of 0 will you mark −1\n2? Being a negative rational number , it would be\nmarked to the left of 0.\nYou know that while marking integers on the number line, successive integers are\nmarked at equal intervels.

It is marked at a point which is half the\ndistance between 0 and 1. So, −1\n2 would be marked at a point half the distance between\n0 and –1.\nWe know how to mark 3\n2 on the number line. It is marked on the right of 0 and lies\nhalfway between 1 and 2. Let us now mark 3\n2− on the number line.

The integer – 2 is on\nthe right of – 5 on the number line and  – 2 > – 5.\nShe used this method for rational numbers also. She knew how to mark rational numbers\non the number line.

Thus, −1\n5>−1\n2 or −1\n2<−1\n5.\nCan you compare −3\n4 and −2\n3? −1\n3 and −1\n5?\nWe know from our study of fractions that 1\n5<1\n2. And what did Mary get for −1\n2 and\n−1\n5? Was it not exactly the opposite?\nYou will find that, 1\n2>1\n5 but −1\n2<−1\n5.\nDo you observe the same for −3\n4, −2\n3 and 1\n3−, −1\n5?\nMary remembered that in integers she had studied  4 > 3\nbut – 4 < –3, 5 > 2 but –5 < –2 etc.−=−1\n25\n10−=−1\n52\n10–1 0 1\n2024-25\n\nRATIONAL NUMBERS 131\n/circle6The case of pairs of negative rational numbers is similar .

A negative rational\nnumber is to the left of zero whereas a positive rational number is to the right of zero on\na number line.

The numbers 2 3, ,37 8− etc. are rational numbers.\n2.All integers and fractions are rational numbers.\n3.If the numerator and denominator of a rational number are multiplied or divided by a\nnon-zero integer, we get a rational number which is said to be equivalent to the given\nrational number . For example 3 3 2 6\n7 7 2 14− − × −= =×. So, we say 6\n14− is the equivalent\nform of 3\n7−. Also note that 6 6 2 3\n14 14 2 7− − ÷ −= =÷.\n4.Rational numbers are classified as Positive and Negative rational numbers. When the\nnumerator and denominator , both, are positive integers, it is a positive rational number .\nWhen either the numerator or the denominator is a negative integer , it is a negative\nrational number . For example, 3\n8 is a positive rational number whereas 8\n9− is a\nnegative rational number .\n5.The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number .\n6.A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a positive\ninteger and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1.\nThe numbers 1 2,3 7− etc. are in standard form.\n7.There are unlimited number of rational numbers between two rational numbers.\n8.Two rational numbers with the same denominator can be added by adding their\nnumerators, keeping the denominator same. Two rational numbers with dif ferent\ndenominators are added by first taking the LCM of the two denominators and\nthen converting both the rational numbers to their equivalent forms having the\nLCM as the denominator .

She wants to put lace around\nto decorate these cards. What length of the lace does she require for each? (Fig 9.19)\n(a) (b) (c)\nFig 9.19\nYou cannot measure the curves with the help of a ruler , as these figures are not “straight”.\nWhat can you do?\nHere is a way to find the length of lace required for shape in\nFig 9.19(a). Mark a point on the edge of the card and place the\ncard on the table. Mark the position of the point on the table also\n(Fig 9. 20).\nNow roll the circular card on the table along a straight line till\nthe marked point again touches the table. Measure the distance\nalong the line. This is the length of the lace required (Fig 9.21). It is also the distance along\nthe edge of the card from the marked point back to the marked point.\nYou can also find the distance by putting a string on the edge of the circular object and\ntaking all round it.\nThe distance around a circular region is known as its circumference.\nTake a bottle cap, a bangle or any other circular object and find the circumference.\nNow, can you find the distance covered by the athlete on the track by this method?\nStill, it will be very difficult to find the distance around the track or any other circular\nobject by measuring through string. Moreover , the measurement will not be accurate.\nSo, we need some formula for this, as we have for rectilinear figures or shapes.\nLet us see if there is any relationship between the diameter and the circumference of\nthe circles.\nConsider the following table: Draw six circles of different radii and find their circumference\nby using string. Also find the ratio of the circumference to the diameter .\nCircle Radius Diameter Circumference Ratio of Circumference\nto Diameter\n1. 3.5 cm 7.0 cm 22.0 cm22\n7= 3.14Fig 9.20\nFig 9.21\nDO THIS\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 154\n2. 7.0 cm 14.0 cm 44.0 cm44\n14=3.14\n3. 10.5 cm 21.0 cm 66.0 cm66\n21=3.14\n4. 21.0 cm 42.0 cm 132.0 cm132\n42=3.14\n5. 5.0 cm 10.0 cm 32.0 cm32\n10=3.2\n6. 15.0 cm 30.0 cm 94.0 cm94\n30=3.13\nWhat do you infer from the above table? Is this ratio approximately the same? Yes.\nCan you say that the circumference of a circle is always more than three times its\ndiameter? Yes.\nThis ratio is a constant and is denoted by π (pi). Its approximate value is 22\n7 or 3.14.\nSo, we can say that  C\nd= π, where ‘C’ represents circumference of the circle and ‘ d’\nits diameter .\nor C =πd\nWe know that diameter ( d) of a circle is twice the radius ( r) i.e., d = 2r\nSo, C =πd = π × 2r or   C = 2\nπr.\nIn Fig 9.22,\n (a) Which square has the larger perimeter?\n (b) Which is lar ger, perimeter of smaller square or the\ncircumference of the circle?\nTake one each of quarter plate and half plate.

We know that the circumference of circle = 2 πr\nSo, the circumference of the semicircle =   122r× π  = πr\n=    22\n7× 7 cm = 22 cm\nSo, the diameter of the circle =     2 r = 2 × 7 cm = 14 cm\nThus, perimeter of each semicircular disc = 22 cm + 14 cm = 36 cm\n9.3.2  Area of Circle\nConsider the following:\n/circle6 A farmer dug a flower bed of radius 7 m at the centre of a field.

It\ngives nearly a rectangle (Fig 9.28).\nFig 9.28\nWhat is the breadth of this rectangle? The breadth of this rectangle is the radius of the\ncircle, i.e., ‘ r’.\nAs the whole circle is divided into 64 sectors and on each side we have 32 sectors, the\nlength of the rectangle is the length of the 32 sectors, which is half of the circumference.\n(Fig 9.28)\n Area of the circle = Area of rectangle thus formed = l × b\n= (Half of circumference) × radius  = 122r × π  × r = πr2\nSo, the area of the circle = πr2\nDraw circles of dif ferent radii on a graph paper .

It means that a part of electricity consumed is used in producing\nheat. This is not desirable as it results in the wastage of electricity. The fluorescenttube-lights and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are better electricity efficient\nlighting sources. Nowadays, the use of light emitting diode (LED) bulbs is\nincreasing. For producing a given intensity of light, LED bulbs consume lesselectricity as compared to incandescent bulbs or fluorescent tubes or CFLs.Thus\nLED bulbs are much electricity efficient and therefore being preferred.\nFig. 10.13  Electric bulb, tube-light, CFL and LED\nIt is advised to use electrical appliances and gadgets, which are electricity efficient.\nBureau of Indian Standards, New Delhi assigns a Standard Mark on products,\ncalled ISI mark  which is an assurance of conformity to the specifications\ngiven on the products.

This may happen if\nthe insulation on the wires has comeoff due to wear and tear.  This may\ncause a short circuit. Another reason\nfor excessive current can be theconnection of many devices to a single\nsocket.  This may cause overload in\nthe circuit.

There is a maximum\nlimit on the current which can safelyflow through a circuit. If by accident the\ncurrent exceeds this safe limit, the wiresan electric bulb gets heated to such a\nhigh temperature that it starts glowing.\nIf a large current passes through a\nwire, the wire may become so hot that it\nmay even melt and break. But is it\npossible for a wire to melt and break?\nLet us check it out.\nActivity 10.4\nMake the circuit we used for Activity 10.3\nagain. However, replace the cell with a\nbattery of four cells.

Do the pins cling to the\ntip of the nail? Switch off the current.Are the pins still clinging to the end of\nthe nail?\nThe coil in the above activity behaves\nlike a magnet when electric current flowsthrough it. When the electric current is\nswitched off, the coil generally loses itsmagnetism. Such coils are called\nelectromagnets . The electromagnets\ncan be made very strong and can lift\nvery heavy loads.

Move the switch back tothe ‘OFF’ position. Does the compass\nneedle come back to its initial position?\nRepeat the experiment a few times.\nWhat does this experiment indicate?\nWe know that the needle of a compass\nis a tiny magnet, which points in\nnorth-south direction. When we bring\na magnet close to it, the needle gets\ndeflected. We have also seen thatcompass needle gets deflected when the\ncurrent flows in a nearby wire. Can you\nconnect the two observations? When thecurrent flows through a wire, does the\nwire behave like a magnet?\nThis is what a scientist called Hans\nChristian Oersted (Fig. 10.18)  also\nwondered. He was the first person who\nnoticed the deflection of compass needleevery time the current was passed\nthrough the wire.\nSo, when electric current passes\nthrough a wire, it behaves like a magnet.This is the magnetic effect of the electric\ncurrent. In fact, an electric current canbe used to make magnets. Do you find\nit too surprising?  Let us try it out.Remember not to switch on thecurrent for more than a few seconds\nat a time.

Paheli\nsaw her image using the back of a steel\nspoon. “Boojho look here! I can also seemy erect image though it is smaller in\nsize. This spoon also acts as a mirror of\nsome kind”, said Paheli.\nYou can also use a spoon or any\ncurved shining surface to see yourimage.\nActivity 11.5\nTake a stainless steel spoon. Bring the\nouter side of the spoon near your face\nand look into it. Do you see your imagein it (Fig. 11.10)? Is this image different\nfrom what you see in a plane mirror? Is\nthis image erect? Is the size of the imagethe same, smaller or larger?\nFig. 11.10  Image from the outer side of a spoonFig. 11.11  Image from the inner side of a\nspoon\nFig. 11.12  (a) A concave and (b) a convex mirrorNow look at your image using the\ninner side of the spoon. This time youmay find that your image is erect and\nlarger in size. If you increase the distance\nof the spoon from your face, you maysee your image inverted (Fig. 11.11). You\ncan also compare the image of your pen\nor pencil instead of your face.\nThe curved shining surface of a spoon\nacts as a mirror. The most commonexample of a curved mirror is a sphericalmirror.\nIf the reflecting surface of a spherical\nmirror is concave, it is called a concavemirror. If the reflecting surface is convex,\nthen it is a convex mirror (Fig. 11.12).\n(a) (b)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nLIGHT 129CAUTION\nYou will conduct Activity 11.6 in the\nsunlight. Be careful, never lookdirectly towards the Sun or its image\nas it may damage your eyes. You may\nlook at the image of the Sun when itis thrown on a screen or a wall.The inner surface of a spoon acts like\na concave mirror, while its outer surfaceacts like a convex mirror.\nWe know that the image of an object\nformed by a plane mirror cannot beobtained on a screen. Let us investigateif it is also true for the image formed by\na concave mirror.\nActivity 11.6Fig. 11.14  A concave mirror forms a real image\nof the sun\nTake a concave mirror. Hold it facing\nthe Sun. Try to get the light reflected bythe mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust\nthe distance of the paper until you get a\nsharp bright spot on it (Fig. 11.14). Holdthe mirror and the sheet of paper steady\nfor a few minutes. Does the paper start\nburning?\nThis bright spot is, in fact, the image\nof the Sun. Notice that this image isformed on a screen. An image formedon a screen is called a real image .\nRecollect that in Activity 11.2 the imageformed by a plane mirror could not beobtained on a screen. Such an image is\ncalled a virtual image .\nNow let us try to obtain on the screen\nthe image of a candle flame formed by aconcave mirror.\nActivity 11.7\nFix a concave mirror on a stand (any\narrangement to keep the mirror steady\nwould do) and place it on a table\n(Fig. 11.15).

Is it possibleto obtain the image on the screen when\nthe candle is too close to the mirror\n(Fig. 11.16)?\nWe see that the image formed by a\nconcave mirror can be smaller or largerin size than the object. The image mayalso be real or virtual.\nConcave mirrors are used for many\npurposes. You might have seen doctorsusing concave mirrors for examining\neyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave\nmirrors are also used by dentiststo see an enlarged image of the teeth\n(Fig. 11.17).

Convex mirrorscan form images of objects spread over a\nlarge area. So, these help the drivers to\nsee the traffic behind them (Fig. 11.20).\n11.5  I MAGES  FORMED  BY LENSES\nYou might have seen a magnifying glass.It is used to read very small print\n(Fig. 11.21). You might have also used\nit to observe the body parts of acockroach or an earthworm. The\nmagnifying glass is actually a type of a lens.\nLenses are widely used in spectacles,\ntelescopes and microscopes. Try to adda few more uses of lenses to this list.\nGet some lenses. Touch and feel\nthem. Can you find some difference justby touching? Those lenses which feel\nthicker in the middle than at the edgesare convex lenses [Fig. 11.22 (a)]. Thosewhich feel thinner in the middle thanat the edges are concave lenses\n[Fig. 11.22 (b)]. Notice that the lenses\nare transparent and light can passthrough them.\nCAUTION\nIt is dangerous to look through a lens\nat the Sun or a bright light. You\nshould also be careful not to focussunlight with a convex lens on any\npart of your body.\nFig. 11.21  A magnifying glass\nFig. 11.22  (a) A convex lens and (b) a concave\nlens(a)(b)\nLet us play with lenses.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nLIGHT 133\nIt means that we can see the\nimage formed by a lens from the\nside opposite to that of the object.\nActivity 11.9\nTake a convex lens or magnifying glass.\nPut it in the path of sunrays. Place a\nsheet of paper as shown (Fig. 11.23).\nAdjust the distance between the lens andthe paper till you get a bright spot on\nthe paper. Hold the lens and the paper\nin this position for a few minutes. Doesthe paper begin to burn?\nNow replace the convex lens with a\nconcave lens. Do you see a bright spotA convex lens converges (bends\ninward) the light generally falling on it\n[Fig. 11.24 (a)]. Therefore, it is called aconverging lens. On the other hand, a\nconcave lens diverges (bends outward)\nthe light and is called a diverging lens[Fig. 11.24 (b)].\n(b)\non the paper this time, too? Why areyou not getting a bright spot this time?\nWe have seen in the case of mirrors\nthat for different positions of the objectthe nature and size of the image change.Is it true for lenses also?\nLet us find out.\nActivity 11.10\nTake a convex lens and fix it on a standas you did with the concave mirror. Place\nit on a table. Place a lighted candle at a\ndistance of about 50 cm from the lens[Fig. 11.25 (a)]. Try to obtain the imageFig. 11.23  Real image of the sun by a convex\nlens\n(a)\nFig. 11.24\nof the candle on a paper screen placedon the other side of the lens. You may\nhave to move the screen towards or away\nfrom the lens to get a sharp image ofthe flame. What kind of image did you\nget? Is it real or virtual?\nNow vary the distance of the candle\nfrom the lens [Fig. 11.25 (b)]. Try toobtain the image of the candle flame\nevery time on the paper screen bymoving it.

You will findthat the image formed by a concave lensis always virtual, erect and smaller insize than the object (Fig. 11.27).\n11.6 S UNLIGHT  — W HITE OR\nCOLOURED ?\nHave you ever seen a rainbow in the\nsky? You might have noticed that it\nappears usually after the rain when theSun is low in the sky. The rainbow is\nReprint 2024-25\n\nLIGHT 135\nseen as a large arc in the sky with many\ncolours (Fig. 11.28).\nHow many colours are present in a\nrainbow? When observed carefully, thereare seven colours in a rainbow, though\nit may not be easy to distinguish all of\nthem. These are — red, orange, yellow,green, blue, indigo and violet.\nPaheli wants to tell you\nthat you can see a\nrainbow only when your\nback is towards the sun.\nYou  might have seen that when you\nblow soap bubbles, they appearcolourful. Similarly, when light is\nreflected from the surface of a\nCompact Disk (CD), you see manycolours (Fig. 11.29).\nOn the basis of these experiences,\ncould we say that the sunlight is amixture of different colours? Let us\ninvestigate.\nActivity 11.11\nTake a glass prism. Allow a narrow beam\nof sunlight through a small hole in thewindow of a dark room to fall on one\nface of the prism.

This\nmeans that the white light consists of\nseven colours. Try to identify thesecolours and write their names in your\nnotebook.\nCan we mix these colours to get white\nlight? Let us try.\nActivity 11.12\nTake a circular cardboard disc of about10 cm diameter. Divide this disc intoseven segments. Paint the sevenrainbow colours on these segmentsas shown in Fig. 11.31 (a). You canalso paste, coloured papers onthese segments. Make a small hole\nat the centre of the disc. Fix the\ndisc loosely on the tip of a refill of aball pen. Ensure that the disc rotatesfreely [Fig. 11.31 (a)]. Rotate the discin the daylight. When the disc isrotated fast, the colours get mixed\ntogether and the disc appears\nto be whitish [Fig. 11.31 (b)]. Sucha disc is popularly known as Newton’sdisc.\nPaheli has a brilliant idea!

He\nintroduced him to his friends.\nProf Ahmad was a scientist working in\nthe university. The children started\nplaying while Prof Ahmad sat on a\nbench in the corner. He was tired as hehad participated in the golden jubilee\ncelebrations of the town. After a while,\nthe children also came and sat aroundhim. They wanted to know about the\ncelebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that\nafter the cultural programme, thesenior people discussed the town’s\nunemployment problem. A plan was\nproposed to put up a factory by clearingan area of the forest just outside the\ntown. This would give the increasing\npopulation of the town a chance to getjobs. The children were very surprised\nwhen Prof Ahmad told them that many\npeople had objected to this idea.“This is because the forests serve as\ngreen lungs and water purifying systems\nin nature”, Prof Ahmad explained. The\nchildren were confused. Prof Ahmadrealised that the children had not visited\na forest. The children also wanted to\nknow more about the forest, so theydecided to visit it with Prof Ahmad.\n12.1 V ISIT TO A FOREST\nOne Sunday morning, the children\npacked a few things like a knife, a hand\nlens, a stick, a notebook and walkedtogether through a forest trail near a\nvillage. On their way, they met Tibu, a\nyoung boy of their age group, of nearbyvillage, who was taking cattle for grazing\nalong with his aunt. He was very agile,\nrunning here and there to keep the herdtogether. When he saw the children,\nTibu also started walking along with\nthem, while his aunt went on a differentpath. As soon as they entered the forest\nTibu raised his hand and signalled them\nto keep quiet because noise coulddisturb the animals living in the forest.\nTibu then took them to a place at a\nheight to show them the broad view ofthe forest. Children were surprised\nbecause they could not see any land\n(Fig. 12.1). The different treetops hadformed green cover over the land. However,\nthe cover was not uniformly green. The\nFig. 12.1  A view of a forest\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFORESTS : OUR LIFELINE 143environment was peaceful and a cool\nbreeze was blowing. This made childrenquite fresh and happy.\nWhile coming down, they got excited\non hearing a sudden sound of birds andsome noise from the top branches of the\ntrees. Tibu told them to relax since it\nwas a normal phenomenon here.Because of the children’s presence, some\nmonkeys had climbed higher up on the\ntrees where they disturbed the birds.Animals often give this type of warning\ncall to alert other animals. Tibu also told\nthat many other animals like boar,bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live\nin the deeper areas of the forest\n(Fig. 12.2). Prof Ahmad cautionedchildren that they should not go deep\ninto the forest.\nBoojho and Paheli remembered that\nthey have studied about forests as\nFig. 12.2  Some forest animals\nFig. 12.3  Forest as habitat\nan example of a habitat in Class VI(Fig. 12.3). They could see now how the\nforest provides a home for many animalsand plants.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 144The land where the children were\nwalking was uneven and covered with\nmany trees. Tibu helped them to identify\nsal, teak, semal , sheesham , neem ,\npalash , fig, khair , amla , bamboo,\nkachnar (Fig. 12.4). Prof Ahmad pointed\nout that there are several other trees,shrubs, herbs and grasses in the forest.\nThe forest floor and the trees were alsocovered with different types of creepersand climbers. The sun was barely visible\nthrough the leaves of the trees, makingit quite dark inside the forest.\nActivity 12.1\nObserve the various things in your homeand make a list of those which are madefrom material which may have been\nobtained from the forest.\nYou might have many wooden items\non your list like plywood, fuel wood,boxes, paper, matchsticks, and\nfurniture.

Prof Ahmad repliedthat in nature trees produce enough\nseeds. The forest floor providesfavourable conditions for them to\ngerminate and develop into seedlingsProf Ahmad asked children to look\nup and observe how the branches of the\ntall trees look like a roof over the other\nplants in the forest. He told them that\nthis is called a canopy (Fig. 12.7).\nActivity 12.2\nVisit a forest or a park in yourneighbourhood. Observe the trees and\ntry to identify them. You can take the\nhelp of some elders or books on trees.List the characteristics of the trees that\nyou observe, such as the height, shape\nof leaves, crown, flowers, and fruits. Alsodraw the crowns of some trees.\nProf Ahmad pointed out that trees\nhad crowns of different types and sizes.These had created different horizontal\nlayers in the forest. These are known as\nunderstoreys (Fig. 12.7). Giant and talltrees constituted the top layer followed\nby shrubs and tall grasses, and herbs\nformed the lowest layer.\nTable 12.1 Plants and their products\nGum Timber Medicinal Oil\nBabool Sheesham Neem Sandalwood\nSealing wax\nGumCatechu\nHoney\nWooden\nstatue\nFig. 12.5  Forest products\nand saplings.

They\nstarted making sketches of thesecreatures. The forest floor seemed dark\ncoloured and was covered with a layer\nof dead and decaying leaves, fruits,seeds, twigs and small herbs.

What difference will it make if\nwe cut some trees for a factory?”\nProf Ahmad said, “You have read\nabout autotrophs, heterotrophs andsaprotrophs. You have learnt how green\nplants produce food. All animals,whether herbivores or carnivores,depend ultimately on plants for food.Organisms which feed on plants oftenget eaten by other organisms, and so\non. For example, grass is eaten by\ninsects, which in turn, is taken by thefrog. The frog is consumed by snakes.\nThis is said to form a food chain:\nGrass insects frog snake eagle.\nMany food chains can be found in the\nforest. All food chains are linked. If any\none food chain is disturbed, it affectsother food chains. Every part of the\nforest is dependent on the other parts.\nIf we remove one component, say trees,all other components would be affected.”\nPhotosynthesis\nSoilDecomposers\nOxygen\nCarbon dioxide\nWaterNutrients\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 148Paheli reminded Prof Ahmad that he\nhad not explained why forests are called\ngreen lungs.

Prof Ahmad\nexplained that apart from these animals\nwhich are easily seen, there are several\norganisms and micro-organisms thatlive in the soil. Paheli wondered whatmushroom and other micro-organismseat. Prof Ahmad replied that they feedupon the dead plant and animal tissues\nand convert them into a dark coloured\nsubstance called humus .\nIn which layer of the soil would you\nfind humus? What is its importance tothe soil?\nThe micro-organisms which convert\nthe dead plants and animals to humusare known as decomposers . These\nmicro-organisms play an important rolein the forest. Soon, Paheli removed somedead leaves and discovered under thema layer of humus on forest floor.  The\npresence of humus ensures that the\nnutrients of the dead plants andanimals are released into the soil. Fromthere, these nutrients are again absorbedby the roots of the living plants. “Whathappens if an animal dies in the forest?”\nSheila asked. Tibu replied the dead\nanimals become food for vultures, crows,jackals and insects.” In this way, thenutrients are cycled. So, nothing goeswaste in a forest (Fig. 12.9).\nFig. 12.10  Balance of oxygen and carbon\ndioxide\nPaheli reminded their\nfriends that they have\nstudied photosynthesis in\nChapter 1.\nbalance of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nin the atmosphere (Fig. 12.10). That is\nwhy forests are called lungs.\nThe children saw clouds forming in\nthe sky. Boojho recalled what he hadlearnt about the water cycle in Class VI.\nTrees take in water from their roots andrelease water vapour into the air\nthrough evaporation.\nIf there were fewer trees, how will the\nwater cycle be affected?\nTibu told them that the forest is not\njust home to plants and animals. Many\npeople also live in the forest. Some of\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFORESTS : OUR LIFELINE 149them may belong to different tribes. Tibu\nexplained that these people dependmostly on the forests. The forest provides\nthem with food, shelter, water and\nmedicines. They have traditionalknowledge about many medicinal plants\nin the forest.\nWhile Boojho was drinking water\nfrom a small stream, he saw some deer\ncrossing the stream (Fig. 12.11). They\ndisappeared into the bushes. The dense\nbushes and the tall grass provide\nanimals with the food and shelter. Theyshowed the children droppings of some\nanimals, and explained the difference\nbetween various types of droppings.\nProf Ahmad informed them that theforest officers could recognise the\npresence of some animals in the forest\nby their droppings and footprints.\nBoojho called every one and showed\nthem a large, decaying heap of animaldropping. Several beetles and grubswere feeding on the heap and a bunch\nof seedlings was sprouting. “These\nseedlings are of the herbs and shrubs.\nPaheli remembered that she\nsaw a Pipal sapling on the\nsidewall in her school. Can you\nhelp her to understand how this\nwould have happened?\nFig. 12.12  A sapling on a wall\nalso protect them from carnivores that\nlive in the forest.\nTibu then started looking closely at\nthe forest floor. Soon he called andThe animals also disperse the seeds of\ncertain plants and help the forest to growand regenerate. The decaying animaldung also provides nutrients to theseedlings to grow”, said Prof Ahmad.\nAfter listening to this, Boojho noted\nin his notebook, “By harbouring greatervariety of plants, the forest providesgreater opportunities for food andhabitat for the herbivores. Largernumber of herbivores means increased\navailability of food for a variety ofFig. 12.11  Deer in a forest\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 150\ncarnivores. The wide variety of animals\nhelps the forest to regenerate and grow.\nDecomposers help in maintaining the\nsupply of nutrients to the growing plants\nin the forest. Therefore, the forest is a\n‘dynamic living entity ’ — full of life and\nvitality.”\nIt was about afternoon and the\nchildren wanted to go back. Tibusuggested another route for going back.While they were going back, it started\nraining. However, surprisingly, they saw\nthat the raindrops were not hitting the\nforest floor directly. The uppermost layer\nof the forest canopy intercepted the flow\nof raindrops, and most of the water was\ncoming down through the branches and\nthe stems of the trees. From the leaves itFig. 12.13  Rainwater drips from the trees and seeps into the groundCovered ground with\ndecaying material actslike a spongeRain\nThe root system helpswater to seep down inthe groundThe closed canopy andmany layers of vegetationslow down the speed ofraindropsTranspiration and evaporation\nRoot system\nWater table\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFORESTS : OUR LIFELINE 151was dripping slowly over branches of the\nshrubs and herbs (Fig. 12.13). They\nfound that the ground was still dry. After\nabout half an hour, the rain stopped.\nThey noticed that the layer of dead\nleaves over the forest floor appeared wet\nnow. But water did not stagnate in the\nforest.\nBoojho thought that if it had rained\nso heavily in his town, it would have\nflooded the drains and roads.\nWhat would happen if it rains heavily\nin your town?\nProf Ahmad told them that the forest\nalso acts as a natural absorber of\nrainwater and allows it to seep. It helps\nmaintain the water table throughout the\nyear. Forests not only help in controlling\nfloods but also help maintain the flow\nof water in the streams so that we get a\nsteady supply of water. On the other\nhand, if trees are not present, rain hits\nthe ground directly and may flood the\narea around it. Heavy rain may also\ndamages the soil. Roots of trees normally\nbind the soil together, but in their\nabsence the soil is washed away or\neroded.\nThe children spent an hour at Tibu’s\nvillage on their way back. The weather\nof the village was quite pleasant. Villagers\ntold them that due to the surrounding\nforest, they receive good rainfall. The air\nalso remained cool. Noise pollution, too\nis less because the forest absorbs the\nnoise of the nearby highway.\nThe children learnt about the history\nof the village. It surprised them that the\nvillages and the agricultural fields ofthat area were created after clearing the\nforest about sixty years ago. Tibu’s\ngrandfather told them that when he was\nyoung, the village was not as large as it\nwas now. It was also surrounded\nby forests. Construction of roads,\nbuildings, industrial development and\nincreasing demand of wood created\npressure on the forests and it started\nvanishing. He was not happy that the\nforest adjoining their village is not\nregenerating and is on the verge of\ndisappearing due to overgrazing of\nanimals and indiscriminate felling of\ntrees. Prof Ahmad said that if we did\nthings wisely we could preserve forests\nand environment as well as have\ndevelopment.\nChildren prepared a few pictures to\nshow the consequences of such an\nevent.\nAt the end of the visit, Prof Ahmad\nasked children to sum up the\nimportance of forests. The children\nwrote: Forests provide us with oxygen.\nThey protect soil and provide habitat to\na large number of animals. Forests\nhelp in bringing good rainfall in\nneighbouring areas.

The water is then\nremoved from the top.\nThe activated sludge is about 97%\nwater. The water is removed by sanddrying beds or machines. Dried sludge\nis used as manure, returning organicmatter and nutrients to the soil.\nThe treated water has a very low level\nof organic material and suspendedmatter. It is discharged into a sea, a river\nor into the ground. Nature cleans it up\nfurther.  Sometimes it may be necessaryto disinfect water with chemicals like\nchlorine and ozone before releasing it\ninto the distribution system.\nBecome an active citizen\nWaste generation is a natural part ofhuman activity. But we can limit the\na scraper. This is the sludge . A\nskimmer removes the floatable solidslike oil and grease. Water so clearedis called clarified water (Fig. 13.5).\nThe sludge is transferred to a\nseparate tank where it is decomposed\nby the anaerobic bacteria. The biogas\nproduced in the process can be used as\nfuel or can be used to produce electricity.4.

{"class": "7", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 1: nutrition in plants", "content": "Nutrition in Plants1\nIn Class VI you learnt that food is\nessential for all living organisms.You also learnt that carbohydrates,\nproteins, fats, vitamins and minerals arecomponents of food. These componentsof food are called nutrients  and are\nnecessary for our body.\nAll living organisms require food.\nPlants can synthesise food for\nthemselves  but animals including\nhumans cannot. They get it from plantsor animals that eat plants. Thus,\nhumans and animals are directly or\nindirectly dependent on plants.\n1.1 M ODE OF NUTRITION  IN PLANTS\nPlants are the only organisms that canprepare food for themselves by using\nwater, carbon dioxide and minerals. The\nraw materials are present in theirsurroundings.\nThe nutrients enable living\norganisms to build their bodies, to grow,to repair damaged parts of their bodies\nand provide the energy to carry out life\nprocesses. Nutrition  is the mode of\ntaking food by an organism and itsutilisation by the body. The mode ofnutrition in which organisms make food\nthemselves from simple substances is\ncalled autotrophic (auto = self; trophos\n= nourishment) nutrition. Therefore,\nplants are called autotrophs. Animals\nand most other organisms take in food\nprepared by plants. They are called\nheterotrophs ( heteros = other).\nBoojho wants to know\nhow plants prepare\ntheir own food.\nNow we may ask where the food\nfactories of plants are located: whetherfood is made in all parts of a plant or\nonly in certain parts? How do plants\nobtain the raw materials from thesurroundings? How do they transport\nthem to the food factories of plants?\n1.2 P HOTOSYNTHESIS  — F OOD\nMAKING PROCESS  IN PLANTS\nLeaves are the food factories of plants.Therefore, all the raw materials must\nreach the leaf. Water and minerals\npresent in the soil are absorbed by the\nroots and transported to the leaves.\nCarbon dioxide from air is taken in\nPaheli wants to know why\nour body cannot make food\nfrom carbon dioxide, water\nand minerals like plants do.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 2\nPaheli wants to know what is so\nspecial about the leaves that they\ncan synthesise food but  other\nparts of the plant cannot.Cells\nthrough the tiny pores present on the\nsurface of leaves. These pores aresurrounded by ‘guard cells’. Such pores\nare called stomata [Fig. 1.2 (c)].\nWater and minerals are transported\nto the leaves by the vessels which run\nlike pipes throughout the root, the stem,the branches and the leaves. They form\na continuous path or passage for the\nnutrients to reach the leaf. They arecalled vessels. You will learn more about\ntransport of materials in plants in\nChapter 7.The leaves have a green pigment\ncalled chlorophyll . It helps leaves to\ncapture the energy of the sunlight. This\nenergy is used to synthesise (prepare)\nfood from carbon dioxide and water.Since the synthesis of food occurs in the\npresence of sunlight, it is called\nphotosynthesis (Photo: light; synthesis  :\nto combine). So we find that chlorophyll,\nsunlight, carbon dioxide and water are\nnecessary to carry out the process ofphotosynthesis. It is a unique process\non the earth . The solar energy is\ncaptured by the leaves and stored in the\nplant in the form of food. Thus, sun is\nthe ultimate source of energy for allliving organisms.\nCan you imagine life on earth in the\nabsence of photosynthesis!\nIn the absence of photosynthesis\nthere would not be any food. The\nsurvival of almost all living organisms\ndirectly or indirectly depends upon thefood made by the plants. Besides,\noxygen which is essential for the survivalYou have seen that buildings are made of bricks.\nSimilarly, the bodies of living organisms aremade of tiny units called cells. Cells can be seen\nonly under the microscope. Some organismsare made of only one cell. The cell is enclosed bya thin outer boundary, called the cell membrane .\nMost cells have a distinct, centrally locatedspherical structure called the nucleus (Fig. 1.1).The nucleus is surrounded by a jelly-like\nsubstance called cytoplasm .\nCell membraneCytoplasmNucleus\nFig. 1.1 Cell\nBoojho wants to know how water\nand minerals absorbed by roots\nreach the leaves.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nNUTRITION  IN PLANTS 3Besides leaves, photosynthesis also takes place in other green parts of the\nplant — in green stems and green branches. The desert plants have scale- or\nspine-like leaves to reduce loss of water by transpiration. These plants have\ngreen stems which carry out photosynthesis.\nof all organisms is produced duringphotosynthesis. In the absence ofphotosynthesis, life would be impossible\non the earth.\nDuring photosynthesis, chlorophyll\ncontaining cells of leaves (Fig. 1.2), inthe presence of sunlight, use carbon\ndioxide and water to synthesisecarbohydrates (Fig. 1.3). The process\ncan be represented in an equation:\nDuring the process oxygen is\nreleased. The presence of starch in\nleaves indicates the occurrence of\nphotosynthesis. Starch is also a\ncarbohydrate.  \nsunlight\nchlorophyllCarbon dioxide water \nCarbohydrate oxygen\nBoojho has observed some\nplants with deep red, violet or\nbrown leaves. He wants to\nknow whether these leaves\nalso carry out photosynthesis.\nActivity 1.1\nTake two potted plants of the same kind.\nKeep one in the dark (or in a black box)for 72 hours and the other in sunlight.\nFig. 1.2\n(a) LeafGuard cells\n(c) StomaStomatal opening(b) Section of a leaf\nFig. 1.3   Diagram showing\nphotosynthesis\nLight energy\nCarbon\ndioxide\nOxygenChlorophyll\nin leaf\nWater and\nminerals\nStoma Guard CellsChlorophyll\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 4Fig. 1.4  Leaves of various colourscarbohydrates are made of carbon,\nhydrogen and oxygen. These are usedto synthesise other components of food\nsuch as proteins and fats. But proteins\nare nitrogenous substances whichcontain nitrogen. From where do the\nplants obtain nitrogen?\nRecall that nitrogen is present in\nabundance in gaseous form in the air.However, plants cannot absorb nitrogen\nin this form. Soil has certain bacteria thatconvert gaseous nitrogen into a usable\nform and release it into the soil. These\nare absorbed by the plants along withwater. Also, you might have seen farmers\nadding fertilisers rich in nitrogen to the\nsoil. In this way the plants fulfil theirrequirements of nitrogen along with the\nother constituents. Plants can then\nsynthesise proteins and vitamins.\n1.3 O THER MODES OF NUTRITION  IN\nPLANTS\nThere are some plants which do not havechlorophyll. They cannot synthesisefood. How do they survive and from\nwhere do they derive nutrition? Like\nhumans and animals such plantsdepend on the food produced by other\nplants. They use the heterotrophic\nmode of nutrition. Look at Fig. 1.5. Do\nyou see a yellow wiry branched structure\ntwining around the stem and branches\nof a tree? This is a plant called Cuscuta(Amarbel). It does not have chlorophyll.\nIt takes readymade food from the plant\non which it is climbing. The plant onwhich it climbs is called the host. Since\nit deprives the host of valuable nutrients,You often see slimy, green patches\nin ponds or stagnant water bodies. Theseare generally formed by the growth oforganisms called algae. Can you guess\nwhy algae are green in colour? They\ncontain chlorophyll which gives themthe green colour. Algae can also prepare\ntheir own food by photosynthesis.\nSynthesis of plant food other\nthan carbohydrates\nYou have just learnt that plants\nsynthesise carbohydrates through theprocess of photosynthesis. The\nPerform iodine test with the leaves ofboth the plants as you did in Class VI.Record your results. Now leave the pot\nwhich was earlier kept in the dark, in\nthe sunlight for 3 – 4 days and performthe iodine test again on its leaves.\nRecord your observations in your\nnotebook.\nThe leaves other than green also have\nchlorophyll. The large amount of red,brown and other pigments mask thegreen colour (Fig. 1.4). Photosynthesis\ntakes place in these leaves also.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nNUTRITION  IN PLANTS 5Cuscuta is called the parasite . Are we\nand other animals also a kind of\nparasites? You should think about it\nand discuss with your teacher.hair which are directed downwards.When an insect lands in the pitcher, thelid closes and the trapped insect gets\nentangled into the hair. The lid closes\nand the insect is trapped. The insect isdigested by the digestive juices secreted\nin the pitcher and its nutrients are\nabsorbed. Such insect-eating plants arecalled insectivorous plants.\nIs it possible that such plants do not\nget all the required nutrients from thesoil in which they grow?\nFig. 1.5  Cuscuta (Amarbel) on host plant\nPaheli wants to know whether\nmosquitoes, bed bugs, lice and\nleeches that suck our blood are\nalso parasites.\nFig. 1.6  Pitcher plant showing lid and pitcherLeaf modified\ninto pitcherLid\nBoojho is confused. If the\npitcher plant is green and\ncarries out photosynthesis, then\nwhy does it feed on insects?\nHave you seen or heard of plants that\ncan eat animals? There are a few plants\nwhich can trap insects and digest them.Is it not amazing? Such plants may be\ngreen or of some other colour. Look at\nthe plant in Fig. 1.6. The pitcher-like orjug-like structure is the modified part\nof leaf. The apex of the leaf forms a lid\nwhich can open and close the mouth ofthe pitcher. Inside the pitcher there are1.4 S APROTROPHS\nYou might have seen packets of\nmushrooms sold in the vegetable\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 6\nmarket. You may have also seen fluffy\numbrella-like patches growing in moistsoils or on rotting wood during the rainy\nseason (Fig. 1.7). Let us find out what\ntype of nutrients they need to surviveand from where they get them.\nBoojho wants to know how\nthese organisms acquire\nnutrients. They do not have\nmouths like animals do. They are\nnot like green plants as they lack\nchlorophyll and cannot make food\nby photosynthesis.\nActivity 1.2\nTake a piece of bread and moisten it with\nwater. Leave it in a moist warm place\nfor 2–3 days or until fluffy patchesappear on them (Fig. 1.8). What is the\ncolour of these patches? Observe the\npatches under a microscope or amagnifying glass. Write down your\nobservations in the notebook. You will\nsee cotton-like threads spread on thepiece of bread.\nPaheli is keen to know\nwhether her beautiful shoes,\nwhich she wore on special\noccasions, were spoiled by fungi\nduring the rainy season. She\nwants to know how fungi appear\nsuddenly during the rainy\nseason.\nThese organisms are called fungi .\nThey have a different mode of nutrition.They absorb the nutrients from thebread. This mode of nutrition in which\norganisms take in nutrients from dead\nand decaying matter is calledsaprotrophic nutrition . Such organisms\nwith saprotrophic mode of nutrition arecalled saprotrophs .\nFungi also grow on pickles, leather,\nclothes and other articles that are leftin hot and humid weather for long time.During the rainy season they spoil many\nthings. Ask your parents about the\nmenace of fungi in your house.\nThe fungal spores are generally\npresent  in the air.

Do you know why this is done?\nYou learnt that plants absorb\nminerals and nutrients from the soil.So, their amounts in the soil keep ondeclining. Fertilisers and manures\ncontain nutrients such as nitrogen,\npotassium, phosphorous, etc. Thesenutrients need to be added from time\nto time to enrich the soil. We can grow\nplants and keep them healthy ifwe can fulfil the nutrient requirement\nof plants.\nUsually crop plants absorb a lot of\nnitrogen and the soil becomes deficientin nitrogen. You learnt that though\nnitrogen gas is available in plenty in theair, plants cannot use it in the manner\nthey can use carbon dioxide. They need\nnitrogen in a soluble form. Thebacterium called Rhizobium  can take\natmospheric nitrogen and convert it intoa usable form. But Rhizobium cannot\nmake its own food. So it often lives in\nthe roots of gram, peas, moong,  beans\nand other legumes and provides them\nwith nitrogen. In return, the plants\nprovide food and shelter to the\nbacteria. They, thus, have asymbiotic relationship. This association\nis of great significance for the\nfarmers. They can reduce the use ofnitrogenous fertiliser where leguminous\nBoojho says once his\ngrandfather told him that his\nwheat fields were spoiled by a\nfungus. He wants to know if\nfungi cause diseases also.\nPaheli told him that many fungi\nlike yeast and mushrooms are\nuseful, but some fungi\ncause diseases in plants,\nanimals including\nhumans. Some\nfungi are also\nused as medicines.\nwet and warm things they germinate and\ngrow. Now, can you figure out how we\ncan protect our things from gettingspoiled?\nSome organisms live together and\nshare both shelter and nutrients. Thisrelationship is called symbiosis . For\nexample, certain fungi live inside theroots of plants. The plants providenutrients to the fungus and, in return,\nthe fungus provides water and certain\nnutrients.\nIn organisms called lichens , a\nchlorophyll-containing partner, which isan alga, and a fungus live together.

The unused partsof the food are defecated. Have you ever\nwondered what happens to the food\ninside the body? The food passesthrough a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2)\nwhich begins at the buccal cavity and\nends at the anus.

Food is pushed down by\nmovement of the wall of the foodpipe.Actually this movement takes place\nthroughout the alimentary canal and\npushes the food downwards (Fig.  2.7).At times the food is not accepted by our\nstomach and is vomited out. Recall the\ninstances when you vomited after eatingand think of the reason for it. Discuss\nwith your parents and teacher.\nThe stomach\nThe stomach is a thick-walled bag. Itsshape is like a flattened J and it is the\nwidest part of the alimentary canal. Itreceives food from the food pipe at one\nend and opens into the small intestine\nat the other.\nThe inner lining of the stomach\nsecretes mucous, hydrochloric acid anddigestive juices. The mucous protectsthe lining of the stomach. The acid kills\nmany bacteria that enter along with thefood and makes the medium in the\nstomach acidic and helps the digestivejuices to act. The digestive juices break\ndown the proteins  into simpler\nsubstances.\nThe small intestine\nThe small intestine is highly coiled and\nis about 7.5 metres long. It receivessecretions from the liver and the pancreas.\nBesides, its wall also secretes juices.\nThe liver is a reddish brown gland\nsituated in the upper part of theabdomen on the right side. It is the\nlargest gland in the body. It secretes bile\njuice that is stored in a sac called the\ngall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays\nan important role in the digestion of fats.\nThe pancreas is a large cream\ncoloured gland located just below thestomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juiceacts on carbohydrates, fats and proteins\nand changes them into simpler forms.\nFig. 2.8  Alexis St. Martin’s\nshotgun wound\nReprint 2024-25\n\nNUTRITION  IN ANIMALS 17Diarrhoea\nSometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently.\nThis condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food\npoisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children.\nUnder severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of\nwater and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a\ndoctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled waterwith a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration\nSolution (ORS).The partly digested food now reaches thelower part of the small intestine wherethe intestinal juice completes the\ndigestion of all components of the food.\nThe carbohydrates get broken intosimple sugars such as glucose, fats into\nfatty acids and glycerol, and proteins\ninto amino acids.\nAbsorption in the small\nintestine\nThe digested food can now pass into the\nblood vessels in the wall of the intestine.This process is called absorption. The\ninner walls of the small intestine havethousands of finger-like outgrowths.These are called villi (singular villus).\nCan you guess what the role of villi couldbe in the intestine? The villi increasethe surface area for absorption of the\ndigested food. Each villus has a network\nof thin and small blood vessels close toits surface. The surface of the villi\nabsorbs the digested food materials. The\nabsorbed substances are transportedvia the blood vessels to different organs\nof the body where they are used to build\ncomplex substances such as theproteins required by the body. This is\ncalled assimilation . In the cells, glucose\nbreaks down with the help of oxygen\ninto carbon dioxide and water, and\nenergy is released. The food thatremains undigested and unabsorbed\nenters into the large intestine.\nLarge intestine\nThe large intestine is wider and shorterthan small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre\nin length. Its function is to absorb  waterand some salts from the undigested food\nmaterial. The remaining waste passes\ninto the rectum and remains there assemi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is\nremoved through the anus from\ntime-to-time. This is called egestion.\n2.3 D IGESTION  IN GRASS-EATING\nANIMALS\nHave you observed cows, buffaloesand other grass-eating animals\nchewing continuously even when\nthey are not eating? Actually, theyquickly swallow the grass and store\nit in a part of the stomach called\nrumen (Fig. 2.9).

Many\nanimals, including humans, cannotdigest cellulose.\nAnimals like horses, rabbit, etc., have\na large sac-like structure called Caecum\nbetween the oesophagus and the small\nintestine (Fig. 2.9). The cellulose of the\nfood is digested here by the action of\ncertain bacteria which are not present in\nhumans.\nSo far you have learnt about animals\nwhich possess the digestive system. Butthere are many small organisms which do\nnot have a mouth and a digestive system.Then, how do they acquire and digest\nfood? In the section below you will learn\nanother interesting way of food intake.\n2.4 F EEDING  AND DIGESTION  IN\nAMOEBA\nAmoeba is a microscopic single-celledorganism found in pond water. Amoebahas a cell membrane, a rounded, dense\nnucleus and many small bubble-like\nvacuoles (Fig. 2.10) in its cytoplasm.Amoeba constantly changes its shape\nand position. It pushes out one, ormore finger-like projections, calledpseudopodia or false feet for movement\nand capture of food.\nPaheli wants to know why\nthese animals cannot chew\nfood properly at the time they\ntake it in?\npartially digested and is called cud.\nBut later the cud returns to the mouth\nin small lumps and the animal chews\nit. This process is called rumination  and\nthese animals are called ruminants .\nThe grass is rich in cellulose, a type\nof carbohydrate. In ruminants like cattle,deer, etc., bacteria present in rumen\nStomachOesophagus\nLarge IntestineSmall Intestine\nCaecum\nFig. 2.10  AmoebaFood particle\n(ingestion)\nFood vacuolePseudopodium\nEgested waste\nNucleus\nReprint 2024-25\n\nNUTRITION  IN ANIMALS 19\nAmoeba feeds on some microscopic\norganisms. When it senses food, it\npushes out pseudopodia around the\nfood particle and engulfs it. The food\nbecomes trapped in a food vacuole\n[Fig. 2.10).\nDigestive juices are secreted into the\nfood vacuole. They act on the food andbreak it down into simpler substances.\nGradually the digested food is absorbed.The absorbed substances are used for\ngrowth, maintenance and multiplication.The undigested residue of the food is\nexpelled outside by the vacuole.\nThe basic process of digestion of\nfood and release of energy is the samein all animals. In a later chapter you\nwill learn about the transport of foodabsorbed by the intestine to the various\nparts of the body.\nWhat you have learnt\nAnimal nutrition includes nutrient requirement, mode of intake of food\nand its utilisation in the body.\nThe human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal andsecretory glands. It consists of the (i) buccal cavity, (ii) oesophagus,(iii) stomach, (iv) small intestine, (v) large intestine ending in rectumand (vi) anus. The main digestive glands which secrete digestive juicesare (i) the salivary glands, (ii) the liver and (iii) the pancreas. The stomachwall and the wall of the small intestine also secrete digestive juices.\nThe modes of feeding vary in different organisms.\nNutrition is a complex process involving: (i) ingestion, (ii) digestion,(iii) absorption, (iv) assimilation and  (v) egestion.Keywords\nAbsorption\nAmino acidAmoebaAssimilation\nBile\nBuccal cavityCanineCelluloseDigestionEgestionFatty acidFood vacuoleGall bladderGlycerolIncisor\nIngestion\nLiverMilk teethMolarPermanent teethOesophagusPancreasPremolarPseudopodiaRumen\nRuminant\nRuminationSalivary glandsVilli\nSaliva\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 20\nDigestion of carbohydrates, like starch, begins in the buccal cavity. The\ndigestion of protein starts in the stomach. The bile secreted from theliver, the pancreatic juice from the pancreas and the digestive juicefrom the intestinal wall complete the digestion of all components of foodin the small intestine. The digested food is absorbed in the blood vesselsfrom the small intestine.\nThe absorbed substances are transported to different parts of the body.Water and some salts are absorbed from the undigested food in thelarge intestine.\nThe undigested and unabsorbed residues are expelled out of the bodyas faeces through the anus.\nThe grazing animals like cows, buffaloes and deer are known asruminants. They quickly ingest, swallow their leafy food and store it inthe rumen. Later, the food returns to the mouth and the animal chews itpeacefully.\nAmoeba ingests its food with the help of its false feet or pseudopodia.The food is digested in the food vacuole.\nExercises\n1.

You\nalso know that cotton clothes are\nmade from plant fibres. We wear woollen\nclothes during winters when it is cold\noutside. Woollen clothes keep us warm.\nWe prefer to wear light coloured cottonclothes when it is hot. These give us a\nfeeling of coolness. You might have\nwondered why particular types ofclothes are suitable for a particular\nseason.\nIn winter you feel cold inside the\nhouse. If you come out in the sun, youfeel warm. In summer, you feel hot even\ninside the house. How do we knowwhether an object is hot or cold? How\ndo we find out how hot or cold an object\nis? In this chapter we shall try to seekanswers to some of these questions.\n3.1  H OT AND COLD\nIn our day-to-day life, we come across a\nnumber of objects. Some of them are hotWe see that some objects are cold\nwhile some are hot. You also know that\nsome objects are hotter than others\nwhile some are colder than others.  How\ndo we decide which object is hotter thanthe other? We often do it by touching\nthe objects. But is our sense of touch\nreliable? Let us find out.\nActivity 3.1\nTake three small tubs/containers. Labelthem as A, B and C. Put cold water in\ncontainer A and hot water in container\nTable 3.1:  Hot and cold objects\nObject Cold/Cool Warm/Hot\nIce cream \nSpoon in a\ntea cup\nFruit juiceHandle of a\nfrying pan\nFig. 3.1   Feeling water in three containers(A) (B) (C)and some of them are cold.

If\nyou do not have a thermometer, request\na friend to share it with you. A clinical\nthermometer looks like the one shownin Fig. 3.2.\nA clinical thermometer consists of a\nlong, narrow, uniform glass tube. It hasa bulb at one end. This bulb contains\nmercury. Outside the bulb, a small\nshining thread of mercury can be seen.\nIf you do not see the mercury thread,\nrotate the thermometer a bit till you seeit.  You will also find a scale on thethermometer. The scale we use is the\ncelsius scale, indicated by °C.Boojho’s confusion shows that we\ncannot always rely on our sense of touchto decide whether an object\nis hot or cold. Sometimesit may deceive us.\nThen, how do we find\nout how hot an object reallyis? A reliable measure of the\nhotness of an object is its\ntemperature . Temperature is\nmeasured by a device called\nthermometer .\n3.2 M EASURING  TEMPERATURE\nHave you seen a thermometer? Recall\nthat when you or someone else in yourfamily had fever, the temperature was\nmeasured by a thermometer. The\nthermometer that measures our bodytemperature is called a clinical\nthermometer . Hold the thermometer inFig. 3.2  A clinical thermom-\neter\nA clinical thermometer reads\ntemperature from 35°C to 42°C.\nActivity 3.2\nReading a thermometer\nLet us learn how to read a thermometer.\nFirst, note the temperature differenceindicated between the two bigger marks.\nAlso note down the number of divisionsB. Mix some cold and hot water in\ncontainer C.  Now dip your left hand in\ncontainer A and the right hand in\ncontainer B. After keeping the hands inthe two containers for 2–3 minutes, put\nboth the hands simultaneously in\ncontainer C (Fig. 3.1).  Do both thehands get the same feeling?\nBoojho wondered which of the two scales\nshown in Fig. 3.2 he should read.  Paheli told\nhim that India has adopted the celsius scale\nand we should read that scale.  The other scale\nwith the range 94–108 degrees is the\nFahrenheit scale (°F). It was in use earlier.\nBoojho says,“My left hand\ntells me that the water in mug\nC is hot and the right hand\ntells me that the same water\nis cold.  What should I\nconclude?”\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 26\nPrecautions to be observed while using a clinical thermometer\nThermometer should be washed before and after use, preferably with an\nantiseptic solution.\nEnsure that before use the mercury level is below 35°C.\nRead the thermometer keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight.(See Fig. 3.3).\nHandle the thermometer with care. If it hits against some hard object, it can\nbreak.\nDon’t hold the thermometer by the bulb while reading it.\n(shown by smaller marks) between thesemarks.  Suppose the bigger marks read\none degree and there are five divisionsbetween them.  Then, one small division\ncan read \n10.2 C5 .\nWash the thermometer, preferably\nwith an antiseptic solution. Hold it\nfirmly and give it a few jerks. The jerks\nwill bring the level of mercury down.Ensure that it falls below 35°C.  Now\nplace the bulb of the thermometer\nFig. 3.3  Correct method of reading a clinical\nthermometerunder your tongue. After one minute,\ntake the thermometer out and note thereading.  This is your body temperature.\nThe temperature should always be\nstated with its unit, °C.\nWhat did you record as your body\ntemperature?\nThe normal temperature of human\nbody is 37°C. Note that the temperature\nis stated with its unit.\nLet us try to assure Paheli that there\nis nothing wrong with her.\nActivity 3.3\nMeasure the body temperature of someof your friends (at least 10) with a\nTable 3.2: Body temperature of\nsome persons\nName Temperature (°C)\nPaheli measured her body\ntemperature.

Record your\nobservations as in Table 3.2.\nIs the body temperature of every\nperson 37°C?\nThe temperature of every person may\nnot be 37°C.  It could be slightly higher\nor slightly lower.  Actually, what we call\nnormal temperature is the average bodytemperature of a large number of healthy\npersons.\nThe clinical thermometer is designed\nto measure the temperature of humanbody only.  The temperature of human\nbody normally does not go below 35\noC\nor above 42oC. That is the reason\nthat this thermometer has the range35\noC to 42oC.Different types of thermometersare used for different purposes.The maximum and minimum\ntemperatures of the previous\nday, reported in weatherreports, are measured by a\nthermometer called the\nmaximum -minimum\nthermometer.\nCAUTION\nDo not use a clinical thermometer formeasuring the temperature of any\nobject other than the human body.\nAlso avoid keeping the thermometer inthe sun or near a flame. It may break.this thermometer.  Look at itcarefully and note the highest and\nthe lowest temperature it can\nmeasure. The range of alaboratory thermometer is\ngenerally from –10°C to 110°C\n(Fig. 3.4).

You would need this\ninformation to read the\nthermometer correctly.\nLet us now learn how this\nthermometer is used.\nActivity 3.4\nTake some tap water in a beaker\nor a mug.

Dip the thermometer in water.\nWait till the mercury thread becomessteady and note the temperature.  Now\ntake out the thermometer from water.\nObserve carefully what happens now.Do you notice that as soon as you take\nthe thermometer out of water, the level\nof mercury begins to fall.  This meansthat the temperature must be read while\nthe thermometer is in water.\nYou may recall that while taking your\nown temperature, you have to take thethermometer out of your mouth to note\nthe reading. Can you then use thelaboratory thermometer to measure yourIn addition to the precautions to be taken while reading a clinical\nthermometer, the laboratory thermometer\nshould be kept upright not tilted.

Do you see a kink near the bulb(Fig. 3.6).\nWhat is the use of the kink? It\nprevents mercury level from falling onits own.in all cases heat flows from a hotterobject to a colder object.\nHow does heat flow?  Let us\ninvestigate.\nActivity 3.6\nTake a rod or flat strip of a metal, say ofaluminium or iron.  Fix a few small waxpieces on the rod.  These pieces should\nbe at nearly equal distances (Fig. 3.7).\nClamp the rod to a stand. If you do notfind a stand, you can   put one end of\nthe rod in between bricks.  Now, heat\nthe other end of the rod and observe.\nWhat happens to the wax pieces?  Do\nthese pieces begin to fall? Which piecefalls the first? Do you think that heat isFig. 3.6  A clinical thermometer has a kink in it\n3.4 T RANSFER  OF HEAT\nYou might have observed that a frying\npan becomes hot when kept on a flame.\nIt is because the heat passes from theflame to the utensil. When the pan is\nremoved from the fire, it slowly cools\ndown.  Why does it cool down?  The heatis transferred from the pan to the\nsurroundings.  So you can understand\nthat in both cases, the heat flows froma hotter object to a colder object. In fact,\nPaheli asks: “Does it mean\nthat heat will not be\ntransferred if the temperature of\ntwo objects is the same?”\ntransferred from the end nearest to theflame to the other end?\nThe process by which heat is\ntransferred from the hotter end to thecolder end of an object is known asconduction .

Wait for a fewminutes. Touch the other end. Enteryour observation in Table 3.3.\nThe materials which allow heat to\npass through them easily areconductors  of heat. For examples,\naluminum, iron and copper. The\nmaterials which do not allow heat to\npass through them easily are poorconductors of heat such as plastic and\nwood. Poor conductors are known as\ninsulators .\nThe water and air are poor\nconductors of heat. Then, how does theheat transfer take place in thesesubstances?  Let us find out.\nActivity 3.8\nTake a  round bottom flask (if flask is\nnot available, a beaker can be used).  Fillit two-thirds with water. Place it on atripod, or make some arrangement to\nplace the flask in such a way that you\ncan heat it by placing a candle below it.Wait till the water in the flask is\nstill. Place a crystal of potassium\npermanganate at the bottom of the flaskgently using a straw. Now, heat the water\nby placing the candle just below the\ncrystal.\nWrite your observation in your\nnotebook and also draw a picture of\nwhat you observe (Fig. 3.9).\nWhen water is heated,\nthe water near the flame getshot.

Therefore, the\nhand above the flame feels hot. On thesides, however, there is no convection\nand air does not feel as hot as at\nthe top.\n The people living in the coastal areas\nexperience an interesting phenomenon.During the day, the land gets heatedfaster than the water. The air over the\nland becomes hotter and rises up. The\ncooler air from the sea rushes in towardsthe land to take its place. The warm air\nfrom the land moves towards the sea to\ncomplete the cycle (Fig. 3.11). The airfrom the sea is called the sea breeze . To\nreceive the cooler sea breeze, the windowsof the houses in coastal areas are madeto face the sea.  At night it is exactly the\nreverse. The water cools down more\nslowly than the land. So, the cool airfrom the land moves towards the sea.\nThis is called  the land breeze .\nWhen we come out in the sun, we\nfeel warm. How does the heat from thesun reach us? It cannot reach us by\nconduction or convection as there is nomedium such as air in most part of the\nspace between the earth and the sun.and water from the sides moves down.\nThis process continues till the whole\nwater gets heated. This mode of heat\ntransfer is known as convection.\nHow does the heat travel in air?  In\nwhich direction does the smoke go?\nThe air near the heat source gets hot\nand rises.  The air from the sides comes\nin to take its place. In this way the air\ngets heated. The following activityconfirms this idea.\nActivity 3.9\nLight a candle. Keep one hand above the\nflame and one hand on the side of the\nflame  (Fig. 3.10). Do your hands feelequally hot?  If not which hand feels\nhotter?

Keep your hands at a safedistance from the flame so that they\ndo not get burnt.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 32From the sun the heat comes to us by\nanother process known as radiation .\nThe transfer of heat by radiation doesnot require any medium. It can takeplace whether a medium is present or\nnot. When we sit in front of a room\nheater, we get heat by this process. Ahot utensil kept away from the flame\ncools down as it transfers heat to the\nsurroundings by radiation. Our bodytoo, gives heat to the surroundings and\nreceives heat from it by radiation.\nAll hot bodies radiate heat.  When\nthis heat falls on some object, a part ofit is reflected, a part is absorbed and a\npart may be transmitted. Thetemperature of the object increases due\nto the absorbed part of the heat.

One way of doing this is to use hollow\nbricks, which are available these days.\nwhich can is the water warmer?  Youcan feel the difference even by touchingwater in the two cans.\nActivity 3.11\nFill the two cans used in Activity 3.10\nwith the same amount of hot water at\nthe same temperature (say, at 60oC).\nLeave the cans in a room or in a shade.\nNote the temperature of water after\n10–15 minutes.  Does the temperature\nof water in both the cans fall by the same\namount?\nDo these activities suggest to you the\nreason why it is more comfortable towear white or light-coloured clothes inthe summer and dark-coloured clothes\nin the winter? Dark surfaces absorb\nmore heat and, therefore, we feel\ncomfortable with dark coloured clothes\nin the winter. Light coloured clothes\nreflect most of the heat that falls on them\nand, therefore, we feel more comfortable\nwearing them in the summer.\nWoollen clothes keep us warm\nin winter\nIn the winter, we use woollen clothes.\nWool is a poor conductor of heat.\nMoreover, there is air trapped in betweenthe wool fibres. This air prevents the flowof heat from our body to the coldsurroundings. So, we feel warm.\nSuppose you are given the choice in\nwinter of using either one thick blanketor two thin blankets joined together.What would you choose and why?Remember that there would be a layerof air in between the blankets.Fig. 3.12  Containers with black and white\nsurface\nKeywords\nCelsius scale\nConductionConductor\nConvectionInsulator\nLand breezeRadiationSea breeze\nTemperatureThermometer\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 34\nWhat you have learnt\nOur sense of touch is not always a reliable guide to the degree of hotness\nof an object.\nTemperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object.\nThermometer is a device used for measuring temperature.\nClinical thermometer is used to measure our body temperature.

The word acid comes from the\nLatin word acere  which means sour.\nThe acids in these substances arenatural acids.\nWhat about baking soda? Does it also\ntaste sour? If not, what is its taste? Since,it does not taste sour it means, that ithas no acids in it. It is bitter in taste. If\nyou rub it s solution between fingers, it\nfeels soapy. Generally, substances like\nthese which are bitter in taste and feel\nsoapy on touching are known as bases .\nThe nature of such substances is said to\nbe basic .\nIf we cannot taste every substance,\nhow do we find its nature?\nSpecial type of substances are used\nto test whether a substance is acidic orbasic.

Do you observe any change\nin colour of the acid?\nAdd to the acidic solution a drop of\nsodium hydroxide solution by a dropper.Are you familiar with the term acid rain? Have you ever heard about damagingeffect of acid rain? As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is\ncalled an acid rain. Where do these acids come from? The rain becomes acidic\nbecause carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are releasedinto the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric\nacid and nitric acid respectively. Acid rain can cause damage to buildings,\nhistorical monuments, plants and animals.\nCAUTION\nGreat care should be taken whilehandling laboratory acids and basesbecause these are corrosive in nature,\nirritating and harmful to skin.\nBase\nAcid + Indicator\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 44When an acidic solution is mixed\nwith a basic solution, both the solutions\nneutralise the effect of each other. When\nan acid solution and a base solution are\nmixed in suitable amounts, both theacidic nature of the acid and the basic\nnature of the base are destroyed. The\nresulting solution is neither acidic norbasic. Touch the test tube immediately\nafter neutralisation. What do you\nobserve? In neutralisation reaction, heatis always produced, or evolved. The\nevolved heat raises the temperature of\nthe reaction mixture.\nIn neutralisation reaction a new\nsubstance is formed. This is called salt.Salt may be acidic, basic or neutral innature. Thus, neutralisation can be\ndefined as follows:\nThe reaction between an acid and\na base is known as neutralisation. Saltand water are produced in this process\nwith the evolution of heat.\nAcid+Base  Salt+Water\n     (Heat is evolved)\nThe following reaction is an example:Hydrochloric acid (HCl) + Sodium\nhydroxide (NaOH) \nSodium chloride (NaCl) + Water (H\n2O)\nBoojho added dilute sulphuric acid\nto lime water. Will the reaction mixturebecome hot or cool?\n4.4 N EUTRALISATION  IN EVERYDAY\nLIFE\nIndigestion\nOur stomach contains hydrochloricacid. It helps us to digest food, as youhave learnt in Chapter 2. But toomuch of acid in the stomach causesindigestion. Sometimes indigestion\nis painful. To relieve indigestion, we\ntake an antacid such as milk ofmagnesia, which contains magnesium\nhydroxide. It neutralises the effect of\nexcessive acid.\nAnt bite\nWhen an ant bites, it injectsthe acidic liquid (formic acid) into theskin. The effect of the acid can be\nneutralised by rubbing moist baking\nsoda (sodium hydrogencarbonate) orcalamine solution, which contains zinc\ncarbonate.\nSoil treatment\nExcessive use of chemical fertilisers\nmakes the soil acidic. Plants do notgrow well when the soil is either too\nacidic  or too basic . When the soil is\ntoo acidic, it is treated with bases like\nquick lime (calcium oxide) or slaked\nlime (calcium hydroxide). If the soil\nis basic, organic matter (compost) is\nadded to it. Organic matter releases\nacids which neutralises the basic\nnature of the soil.\nFactory wastes\nThe wastes of many factoriescontain acids. If they are allowed to\nflow into the water bodies, the acids\nwill kill fish and other organisms.The factory wastes are, therefore,\nneutralised by adding basic\nsubstances.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nACIDS, BASES AND SALTS 45\nWhat you have learnt\nAcids are sour in taste. Generally, bases are bitter in taste and soapy to\ntouch.\nAcid turns blue litmus red. Bases turn red litmus blue.\nSubstances which are neither acidic nor basic are called neutral.\nSolutions of substances that show different colour in acidic, basic andneutral solutions are called indicators.\nAn acid and a base neutralise each other and form a salt. A salt may beacidic, basic or neutral in nature.\nExercises\n1. State differences between acids and bases.\n2. Ammonia is found in many household products, such as window\ncleaners.

The change ofThe change in the test tube is as\nfollows:\nVinegar (Acetic acid) + Baking soda\n(Sodium hydrogencarbonate) \nCarbon dioxide + other substances\nThe reaction between carbon dioxide\nand lime water is as follows:Fig. 5.4   Change in colour of the copper sulphate\nsolution due to reaction with ironCopper sulphate\n(blue)Iron sulphate (greenish)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nPHYSICAL  AND CHEMICAL  CHANGES 51Carbon dioxide (CO2) + Lime water\n[Ca(OH)2] Calcium Carbonate\n(CaCO3) + Water (H2O)\nWhen carbon dioxide is passed\nthrough lime water, calcium carbonate\nis formed, which makes lime water milky.\nThe turning of lime water  into milky is a\nstandard test of carbon dioxide. You will\nuse it in Chapter 6 to show that the air\nwe breathe out is rich in carbon dioxide.\nIn Activities 5.6–5.8, you saw that\nin each change one or more newsubstances were formed. In Activity 5.6,the ash was the new substance formed\nwhen magnesium was burnt in air. In\nActivity 5.7, the reaction of copper\nsulphate with iron produced iron\nsulphate and copper.  Both of these are\nnew substances. Copper was depositedon the shaving blade of iron. In Activity\n5.8, vinegar and baking soda together\nproduced carbon dioxide, which turnedlime water milky. Can you name the new\nsubstance formed in this reaction?A change in which one or more\nnew substances are formed is called a\nchemical change . A chemical change\nis also called a chemical reaction .\nChemical changes are very important\nin our lives.  All new substances are\nformed as a result of chemical changes.\nFor example, digestion of food in ourbody, ripening of fruits, fermentation of\ngrapes, etc., happen due to series of\nchemical changes. A medicine is the endproduct of a chain of chemical reactions.\nUseful new materials, such as plastics\nand detergents, are produced bychemical reactions. Indeed, every new\nmaterial is discovered by studying\nchemical changes.\nWe have seen that one or more new\nsubstances are produced in a chemicalchange.  In addition to new products,the following may accompany a chemical\nchange:\nHeat, light or any other radiation\n(ultraviolet, for example) may be given\noff or absorbed.\nSound may be produced.\nA change in smell may take place or\na new smell may be given off.\nA colour change may take place .\nA gas may be formed.\nLet us look at some examples.You saw that burning of magnesium\nribbon is a chemical change.  Burningof coal, wood or leaves is also a chemicalchange. In fact, burning of any\nsubstance is a chemical change.\nBurning is always accompanied byproduction of heat.Fig. 5.5  Set up to pass gas through lime water\nVinegar +\nBaking sodaCarbondioxide\nLimewater\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 52Explosion of a firework is a chemical\nchange. You know that such an\nexplosion produces heat, light, sound\nand unpleasant gases that pollute the\natmosphere. That is why you are advisednot to play with fireworks.\nWhen food gets spoiled, it produces\na foul smell. Shall we call this change achemical change?\nYou must have noticed that a slice of\nan apple acquires a brown colour if it isnot consumed immediately. If you have\nnot seen this change in colour, cut a\nfresh slice of apple and keep it away forsome time. Repeat the same activity with\na slice of potato or brinjal. The change\nof colour in these cases is due to theformation of new substances. Are not\nthese changes chemical changes?\nIn Chapter 4, you neutralised an acid\nwith a base.  Is neutralisation a chemicalchange?5.3 R USTING  OF IRON\nLet us get back to rusting. This is onechange that affects iron articles and\nslowly destroys them. Since iron is usedin making bridges, ships, cars, truck\nbodies and many other articles, the\nmonetary loss due to rusting is huge.\nThe process of rusting can be\nrepresented by the following equation:\nIron (Fe) + Oxygen (O\n2, from the air)\n+ water (H2O)  rust (iron oxide Fe2O3)\nFor rusting, the presence of both\noxygen and water (or water vapour)is essential.\nIn fact, if the content of moisture in\nair is high, which means if it is morehumid, rusting becomes faster.\nSo, how do we prevent rusting?\nPrevent iron articles from coming incontact with oxygen, or water, or both.\nOne simple way is to apply a coat of\npaint or grease. In fact, these coatsshould be applied regularly to prevent\nrusting. Another way is to deposit a layer\nof a metal like chromium or zinc on iron.A protective shield\nYou must have heard of the ozone layerin our atmosphere. It protects us fromthe harmful ultraviolet radiation which\ncome from the sun. Ozone absorbs this\nradiation and breaks down to oxygen.Oxygen is different from ozone. Can\nwe call the breaking down of ozone a\nchemical change?\nIf ultraviolet radiation were not\nabsorbed by ozone, it would reach theearth’s surface and cause harm to usand other life forms. Ozone acts as a\nnatural shield against this radiation.\nWe learnt in Chapter 1 that\nplants produce their food by\na process called photosynthesis.\nCan we call photosynthesis\na chemical change?\nPaheli said that even digestion\nis a chemical change.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nPHYSICAL  AND CHEMICAL  CHANGES 53\nCopper sulphate\nCrystalsThis process of depositing a layer of zinc\non iron is called galvanisation . The iron\npipes we use in our homes to carry waterare galvanised to prevent rusting.\nYou know that ships are made of iron\nand a part of them remains under water.On the part above water also, waterdrops keep clinging to the ship’s outer\nsurface. Moreover, the water of the sea\ncontains many salts. The salt watermakes the process of rust formation\nfaster. Therefore, ships suffer a lot of\ndamage from rusting in spite of beingformed from their solutions. The processis called crystallisation .  It is an\nexample of a physical change.\nActivity 5.9\n(To be performed in the presence of\nthe teacher)\nStainless steel is made by mixing ironwith carbon and metals like\nchromium, nickel and manganese.  Itdoes not rust.\nOh, that is why my friend\nRita is always complaining\nabout iron articles rusting so\nfast.  She lives near the coast.\nCAUTION\nUse only dilute sulphuric acid.

The  salt obtained in this manner\nis not pure and the shape of its crystalscannot be seen clearly. However, large\ncrystals of pure substances can beTake a cupful of water in a beaker\nand add a few drops of dilute sulphuric\nacid.  Heat the water. When it startsboiling add copper sulphate powder\nslowly while stirring continuously\n(Fig. 5.6). Continue adding coppersulphate powder till no more powder can\nbe dissolved. Filter the solution.

If not, wait for somemore time.\nFig. 5.6  Crystals of copper sulphate\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 54You have learnt about physical and\nchemical changes. Try to identifychanges that you observe around you\nas physical or chemical changes.\nWhat you have learnt\nChanges can be of two types, physical and chemical.\nPhysical changes are changes in the physical properties of substances.\nNo new substances are formed in these changes.  These changes maybe reversible.\nIn chemical changes new substances are produced.\nSome substances can be obtained in pure state from their solutions bycrystallisation.\nExercises\n1.

{"class": "7", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 6: respiration in organisms", "content": "Respiration in\nOrganisms6\nOne day Boojho was eagerly\nwaiting to meet his\ngrandparents who were coming\nto the town after a year. He was in a real\nhurry as he wanted to receive them at the\nbus-stop. He ran fast and reached the\nbus-stop in a few minutes. He wasbreathing rapidly. His grandmother asked\nhim why he was breathing so fast. Boojho\ntold her that he came running all the way.But the question got stuck in his mind.\nHe wondered why running makes a\nperson breathe faster. The answer toBoojho’s question lies in understanding\nwhy we breathe. Breathing is a part of\nrespiration. Let us learn about respiration.\n6.1 W HY DO WE RESPIRE ?\nIn Chapter 2 you learnt that all\norganisms are made of small\nmicroscopic units called cells. A cell isthe smallest structural and functional\nunit of an organism. Each cell of an\norganism performs certain functionssuch as nutrition, transport, excretion\nand reproduction. To perform these\nfunctions, the cell needs energy. Evenwhen we are eating, sleeping or reading\nwe require energy. But, where does this\nenergy come from? Can you say whyyour parents insist that you should eat\nregularly? The food has stored energy,\nwhich is released during respiration.Therefore, all living organisms respireto get energy from food. During\nbreathing, we breathe in air. You know\nthat air contains oxygen. We breathe outair which is rich in carbon dioxide. The\nair we breathe in is transported to all\nparts of the body and ultimately to eachcell. In  the cells, oxygen in the air helps\nin the breakdown of food. The process\nof breakdown of food in the cell with therelease of energy is called cellular\nrespiration. Cellular respiration takesplace in the  cells of all organisms.\nIn the cell, the food (glucose) is broken\ndown into carbon dioxide and water usingoxygen. When breakdown of glucoseoccurs with the use of oxygen it is called\naerobic  respiration . Food can also be\nbroken down, without using oxygen. This\nis called anaerobic respiration .\nBreakdown of food releases energy.\nYou should know that there are some\norganisms such as yeast that can survivein the absence of air. They are calledanaerobes . They get energy through\nanaerobic respiration. In the absence ofoxygen, glucose breaks down into alcoholand carbon dioxide, as given below:\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 58\nOur muscle cells can also respire\nanaerobically, but only for a short time,\nwhen there is a temporary deficiency of\noxygen. During heavy exercise, fast\nrunning (Fig. 6.1), cycling, walking formany hours or heavy weight lifting, the\ndemand for energy is high. But the\nsupply of oxygen to produce the energyis limited. Then anaerobic respiration\ntakes places in the muscle cells to fulfil\nthe demand of energy:\nFig. 6.1  During exercise, some muscles may\nrespire anaerobicallyHave you ever wondered why you get\nmuscle cramps after heavy exercise? Thecramps occur when muscle cells respire\nanaerobically. The partial breakdown of\nglucose produces lactic acid. Theaccumulation of lactic acid  causes muscle\ncramps. We get relief from cramps after ahot water bath or a massage. Can youguess why it is so? Hot water bath or\nmassage improves circulation of blood.\nAs a result, the supply of oxygen to themuscle cells increases. The increase in\nthe supply of oxygen results in the\ncomplete breakdown of lactic acid intocarbon dioxide and water.\n6.2 B REATHING\nActivity 6.1Yeasts are single-celled organisms.They respire anaerobically and during\nthis process yield alcohol. They are,\ntherefore, used to make wine and beer.\nCAUTION\nDo this activity under the supervision\nof your teacher.\nClose your nostrils and mouth\ntightly and look at a watch. What did\nyou feel after some time? How long were\nyou able to keep both of them closed?\nNote down the time for which you couldhold your breath (Fig. 6.2).\nSo, now you know that you cannot\nsurvive for long without breathing.\n Breathing means taking in air rich\nin oxygen and giving out air rich incarbon dioxide with the help ofrespiratory organs. The taking in of air\nrich in oxygen\n into the body is called\ninhalation and giving out of air rich in\ncarbon dioxide is known as exhalation.\nIt is a continuous process which goes\nReprint 2024-25\n\nRESPIRATION  IN ORGANISMS 59\nyou like to find out your breathing rate?\nDo you want to know whether it isconstant or it changes according to the\nrequirement of oxygen by the body?

Breathein and out normally. Find out how many\ntimes you breathe in and breathe out\nin a minute? Did you inhale the samenumber of times as you exhaled?

Tabulate your findingsand compare your breathing rates under\ndifferent conditions with those of your\nclassmates.\nFrom the above activity, you must\nhave realised that whenever a person\nneeds extra energy, he/she breathesfaster.

Does yourbody receive sufficient oxygen?\nActivity 6.3\nFigure 6.3 shows the various activitiescarried out by a person during a normalday. Can you say in which activity, the\nrate of breathing will be the slowest and\nin which it will be the fastest? Assignnumbers to the pictures in the order of\nincreasing rate of breathing according\nto your experience.\n6.3 H OW DO WE BREATHE ?\nLet us now learn about the mechanismof breathing. Normally we take in air\nthrough our nostrils. When we inhale\nair, it passes through our nostrils intothe nasal cavity . From the nasal cavity,\nthe air reaches our lungs through the\nwindpipe. Lungs are present in thechest cavity (Fig. 6.4). This cavity is\nsurrounded by ribs on the sides. A large,muscular sheet called diaphragm  forms\nthe floor of the chest cavity (Fig. 6.4).\nBreathing involves the movement of the\ndiaphragm and the rib cage.\nDuring inhalation, ribs move up and\noutwards and diaphragm moves down.This movement increases space in ourchest cavity and air rushes into the\nlungs. The lungs get filled with air.\nDuring exhalation, ribs move down andinwards, while diaphragm moves up to\nits former position. This reduces the size\nof the chest cavity and air is pushed outof the lungs (Fig. 6.5). These movements\nin our body can be felt easily. Take aOn an average, an adult human being\nat rest breathes in and out 15–18times in a minute. During heavy\nexercise, the breathing rate can\nincrease upto 25 times per minute.While we exercise, not only do we\nbreathe fast, we also take deep breaths\nand thus inhale more oxygen.\nPaheli wants to know why\nwe yawn when we are\nsleepy or drowsy.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nRESPIRATION  IN ORGANISMS 61deep breath.

However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the\nnasal cavity. This may irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we\nsneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dust-free, clean air enters our body.\nTAKE CARE: When you sneeze, you should cover your nose so that the foreign\nparticles you expel are not inhaled by other persons.Smoking damages lungs.

Otherinsects also have similar openings.\nBoojho wants to know if\ncockroaches, snails, fish,\nearthworms, ants and mosquitoes\nalso have lungs.\nThese openings are called spiracles\n(Fig. 6 .9). Insects have a network of air\ntubes called tracheae for gas exchange.\nOxygen rich air rushes through spiraclesinto the tracheal tubes, diffuses into thebody tissue, and reaches every cell of\nthe body. Similarly, carbon dioxide from\nthe cells goes into the tracheal tubes andmoves out through spiracles. These air\ntubes or tracheae are found only in\ninsects and not in any other group ofanimals.\nFig. 6.8  Effect of exhaled air on lime water\nThe percentage of oxygen and carbondioxide in inhaled and exhaled air.\nInhaled air Exhaled air\nLungs21% oxygen 16.4% oxygen\n4.4% carbon\ndioxide0.04% carbondioxideStraw\nLime water\nEarthworm: Recall from Chapter 6 of\nClass VI that earthworms breathe\nthrough their skins.

You may wonder how gillshelp in breathing. Gills are well supplied\nwith blood vessels (Fig. 6.10) for\nexchange of gases.\nBoojho has seen in televisionprogrammes that whales and\ndolphins often come up to the\nwater surface. They even release\na fountain of water sometimes\nwhile moving upwards. Why do\nthey do so?\n6.7 D O PLANTS ALSO RESPIRE ?\nLike other living organisms, plants also\nrespire for their survival as you have\nlearnt in Class VI.

It releases energy\nfrom the food.\nThe oxygen we inhale is used to breakdown glucose into carbon dioxideand water. Energy is released in the process.\nThe breakdown of glucose occurs in the cells of an organism (cellularrespiration).\nIf the food is broken down with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobicrespiration. If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen, therespiration is called anaerobic respiration.\nDuring heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells isinsufficient, food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration.\nBreathing is a part of the process of respiration during which anorganism takes in the oxygen-rich air and gives out air rich in carbondioxide. The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in differentorganisms.\nDuring inhalation, our lungs expand and then come back to the originalstate as the air moves out during exhalation.\nIncreased physical activity enhances the rate of breathing.\nIn animals like cow, buffalo, dog and cat the respiratory organs and theprocess of breathing are similar to those in humans.\nIn earthworm, the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin.

{"class": "7", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 7: transportation in animals and plants", "content": "Transportation in\nAnimals and Plants7\nYou have learnt earlier that all\norganisms need food, water and\noxygen for survival. They need to\ntransport all these to various parts of\ntheir body. Further, animals need to\ntransport wastes to parts from where\nthey can be removed. Have youwondered how all this is achieved? Look\nat Fig. 7.1. Do you see the heart and\nthe blood vessels? They function totransport substances and together form\nthe circulatory system. In this chapter,\nyou shall learn about transport ofsubstances in animals and plants.\n7.1 C IRCULATORY  SYSTEM\nBlood\nWhat happens when you get a cut on\nyour body? Blood flows out. But what\nis blood? Blood is the fluid which\nflows in blood vessels. It transports\nsubstances like digested food from the\nsmall intestine to the other parts of the\nbody. It carries oxygen from the lungs\nto the cells of the body. It also transports\nwaste for removal from the body.\nHow does the blood carry various\nsubstances? Blood is composed of a\nfluid, called plasma in which different\ntypes of cells are suspended.\nHeart\nVein\nArtery\nWhy is the colour of\nblood red?\nFig. 7.1  Circulatory system\n(Arteries are shown in red colour and veins in blue)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nTRANSPORTATION  IN ANIMALS  AND PLANTS 71One type of cells are the red blood\ncells (RBC) which contain a red pigment\ncalled haemoglobin . Haemoglobin\nbinds with oxygen and transports it to\nall the parts of the body and ultimatelyto all the cells. It will be difficult to\nprovide oxygen efficiently to all the cells\nof the body without haemoglobin. Thepresence of haemoglobin makes blood\nappear red.\nThe blood also has white blood cells\n(WBC) which fight against germs thatmay enter our body.\nBoojho fell down while playing a\ngame and his knee got injured. Bloodwas coming out from the cut. After some\ntime, he noticed that bleeding hadstopped and a dark red clot had plugged\nthe cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.\nThe clot is formed because of the\npresence of another type of cells in theblood, called platelets .\nBlood vessels\nThere are different types of blood vesselsin the body. You know that during\ninhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fillsthe lungs. Oxygen has to be transported\nto the rest of the body.\nAlso, the blood picks up the waste\nmaterials including carbon dioxide fromthe cells. This blood has to go back to\nthe heart for transport to the lungs forremoval of carbon dioxide as you have\nlearnt in Chapter 6. So, two types of\nblood vessels,  arteries  and veins are\npresent in the body.  (Fig. 7.1)\nArteries  carry oxygen-rich blood\nfrom the heart to all parts of the body.Since the blood flow is rapid and at ahigh pressure, the arteries have thickelastic walls.\nLet us perform an activity to study\nthe flow of blood through arteries.\nActivity 7.1\nPlace the middle and index finger ofyour right hand on the inner side of your\nleft wrist (Fig. 7.2). Can you feel some\nthrobbing movements? Why do youthink there is throbbing? This\nthrobbing is called the pulse and it is\ndue to the blood flowing in the arteries.Count the number of pulse beats in one\nminute.\nHow many pulse beats could you\ncount? The number of beats per minuteis called the pulse rate . A resting\nperson, usually has a pulse rate between\n72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other\nplaces in your body where you can feel\nthe pulse.\nRecord your own pulse beats per\nminute and those of your classmates.Insert the values you obtained inTable 7.1 and compare them.\nFig. 7.2  Pulse in the wrist\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 72Table 7.1 Pulse rate\nS. No. Name Pulse per minute\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.5.\nPaheli explained that the\npulmonary artery carries blood\nfrom the heart, so it is called an\nartery and not a vein. It carries\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood to the\nlungs. Pulmonary vein carries\noxygen-rich blood from the\nlungs to the heart. \nVeins  are the vessels which carry\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts\nof the body back to the heart. The veins\nhave thin walls. There are valves presentin veins which allow blood to flow only\ntowards the heart.\nRefer to Fig. 7.3. Do you see the\narteries divide into smaller vessels? On\nreaching the tissues, they divide further\ninto extremely thin tubes called\ncapillaries . The capillaries join to form\nveins which empty into the heart.\nHeart\nThe heart is an organ which beats\ncontinuously to act as a pump for the\ntransport of blood, which carries othersubstances with it.\nImagine a pump working for\nyears without stopping! Absolutelyimpossible. Yet our heart works like a\npump non-stop. Let us now learn about\nthe heart.\nThe heart is located in the chest\ncavity with its lower tip slightly tiltedtowards the left (Fig. 7.1). Hold yourfingers inwards on your palm.

Voluntary\nblood donation is harmless and\npainless and can save precious lives.\nBlood can be donated at hospitals andother places authorised by the\ngovernment. Donated blood are stored\nwith special care in Blood Banks.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nTRANSPORTATION  IN ANIMALS  AND PLANTS 73makes your fist. Your heart is roughly\nthe size of your fist.\nWhat will happen if the blood rich in\noxygen and the blood rich in carbondioxide mix with each other? To avoidthis from happening, the heart has fourchambers. The two upper chambers arecalled the atria (singular: atrium) and\nthe two lower chambers are called the\nventricles  (Fig. 7.4). The partition\nbetween the chambers  helps to avoid\nPaheli wonders which side of\nthe heart will have oxygen-rich\nblood and which side will have\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood.\nFig. 7.4  Sections of human heart\nVena Cava\nRight atrium\nRight ventriclePartition completely\nseparating the twohalvesLeft atrium\nLeft ventriclePulmonary artery\nPulmonary vein\nmixing up of blood rich in oxygen with\nthe blood rich in carbon dioxide.\nTo understand the functioning of the\ncirculatory system, start from the rightside of the heart in Fig. 7.3 and follow\nthe arrows. These arrows show thedirection of the blood flow from the heartAorta\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 74to the lungs and back to the heart from\nwhere it is pumped to the rest of thebody.\nHeartbeat\nThe walls of the chambers of the heart\nare made up of muscles. These muscles\ncontract and relax rhythmically. Thisrhythmic contraction followed by its\nrelaxation constitute a heartbeat.\nRemember that heartbeats continueevery moment of our life. If you place\nyour hand on the left side of your chest,\nyou can feel your heartbeat. The doctorfeels your heartbeats with the help of\nan instrument called a stethoscope.\nA doctor uses the stethoscope as a\ndevice to amplify the sound of the heart.It consists of a chest piece that carries a\nsensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces anda tube joining the parts. Doctors can\nget clues about the condition of yourheart by listening through a\nstethoscope.\nLet us construct a model of a\nstethoscope with the materials that areavailable around us.\nActivity 7.2\nTake a small funnel of 6–7 cm indiameter. Fix a rubber tube (50 cm long)\ntightly on the stem of the funnel. Stretch\na rubber sheet (or a balloon) on themouth of the funnel and fix it tightly\nwith a rubber band. Put the open end\nof the tube on one of your ears.

Now try to listencarefully. Do you hear a regular\nthumping sound ? The sound is that of\nheart beats. How many times did yourheart beat in a minute ? Count again\nafter running for 4–5 minutes. Compare\nyour observations.\nRecord your own pulse rate and heart\nbeat and that of your friends whileresting and after running and record inTable 7.2. Do you find any relationship\nbetween your heart beat and pulse rate?\nEach heart beat generates one pulse inthe arteries and the pulse rate per\nminute indicates the rate of heart beat.\nThe rhythmic beating of the various\nchambers of the heart maintaincirculation of blood and transport of\nsubstances to the different parts of thebody.\nBoojho wonders if sponges and\nhydra  also have blood? Animals such\nas sponges and Hydra do not possess\nany circulatory system. The water inwhich they live brings food and oxygenas it enters their bodies. The watercarries away waste materials and carbondioxide as it moves out. Thus, these\nanimals do not need a circulatory fluid\nlike the blood.\nLet us now learn about the removal\nof waste other than carbon dioxide.\n7.2 E XCRETION  IN ANIMALS\nRecall how carbon dioxide is removed\nas waste from the body through the\nlungs during exhalation. Also recall thatthe undigested food is removed during\negestion. Let us now find out how the\nother waste materials are removed fromthe body. You may wonder where these\nunwanted materials come from!\nWhen our cells perform their\nfunctions, certain waste products arereleased. These are toxic and hence need\nto be removed from the body. Theprocess of removal of wastes produced\nin the cells of the living organisms is\ncalled excretion . The parts involved in\nexcretion form the excretory system .\nExcretory system in humans\nThe waste which is present in the blood\nhas to be removed from the body. How\ncan this be done? A mechanism to filterthe blood is required. This is done by\nthe blood capillaries in the kidneys .\nWhen the blood reaches the two kidneys,\nit contains both useful and harmful\nsubstances. The useful substances are\nabsorbed back into the blood. Thewastes dissolved in water are removed\nas urine . From the kidneys, the urine\ngoes into the urinary bladder throughThe English physician, William Harvey\n(A.D.1578–1657), discovered thecirculation of blood. The current\nopinion in those days was that blood\noscillates in the vessels of the body.For his views, Harvey was ridiculed\nand was called “circulator”. He lost\nmost of his patients. However, beforehe died, Harvey’s idea about\ncirculation was generally accepted as\na biological fact.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 76Sometimes a person’s kidneys may\nstop working due to infection or\ninjury. As a result of kidney failure,\nwaste products start accumulating inthe blood. Such persons cannot\nsurvive unless their blood is filtered\nperiodically through an artificialkidney. This process is called dialysis .tube-like ureters . It is stored in the\nbladder and is passed out through the\nurinary opening at the end of a\nmuscular tube called urethra  (Fig. 7.6).\nThe kindeys, ureters, bladder and\nurethra form the excretory system.\nAn adult human being normally\npasses about 1–1.8 L of urine in 24hours. The urine consists of 95% water,\n2.5% urea and 2.5% other wasteproducts.\nWe have all experienced that we sweat\non a hot summer day. The sweat\nPaheli wants to know\nwhether other animals also\nurinate?\nThe way in which waste chemicals\nare removed from the body of the\nanimal depends on the availabilityof water. Aquatic animals like fishes,\nexcrete cell waste as ammonia which\ndirectly dissolves in water. Someland animals like birds, lizards,\nsnakes excrete a semi-solid, white\ncoloured compound (uric acid). Themajor excretory product in humans\nis urea.Fig. 7.6   Human excretory system\nKidney\nUreter\nUrinary bladder\nUrethracontains water and salts. Boojho has\nseen that sometimes in summer, whitepatches are formed on our clothes,\nespecially in areas like underarms.\nThese marks are left by salts present inthe sweat.\nDoes sweat serve any other function?\nWe know that the water kept in anearthen pot ( matka ) is cooler. This is\nbecause the water evaporates from thepores of the pot, which causes cooling.\nUrinary opening\nReprint 2024-25\n\nTRANSPORTATION  IN ANIMALS  AND PLANTS 77\nSimilarly, when we sweat, it helps to cool\nour body.\n7.3 T RANSPORT  OF SUBSTANCES  IN\nPLANTS\nIn Chapter 1 you learnt that plants takewater and mineral nutrients from the soilthrough the roots and transport it to the\nleaves. The leaves prepare food for the\nplant, using water and carbon dioxide\nduring photosynthesis. You also learnt in\nChapter 6 that food is the source of energy\nand every cell of an organism gets energyby the breakdown of glucose. The cells\nuse this energy to carry out vital activitiesof life. Therefore food must be madeavailable to every cell of an organism.\nHave you ever wondered how water and\nnutrients absorbed by the root aretransported to the leaves? How is the\nfood prepared by the leaves carried to\nthe parts which cannot make food?\nTransport of water and\nminerals\nPlants absorb water and minerals by\nthe roots. The roots have root hair.The root hair increase the surface areaof the root for the absorption of waterand mineral nutrients dissolved in\nwater. The root hair is in contact with\nthe water present between the soilparticles [Fig. 7.7 (a)].\nCan you guess how water moves\nfrom the root to the leaves? What kindof transport system is present in plants?\nBoojho thinks that plants\nmay have pipes to transport\nwater to the entire plant like\nwe have in our homes for the\nsupply of water.\n(a)(b)\nXylem vesselsFig. 7.7  Transport of water and minerals in\n(a) a section of root, (b) a treeRoot hair\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 78\nWell, Boojho is right. Plants have\npipe-like vessels to transport water and\nnutrients from the soil. The vessels are\nmade of special cells, forming the\nvascular tissue . A tissue is a group of\ncells that perform specialised function\nin an organism. The vascular tissue for\nthe transport of water and nutrients in theplant is called the xylem [Fig. 7.7 (a)].\nThe xylem forms a continuous\nnetwork of channels that connects rootsto the leaves through the stem and\nbranches and thus transports water to\nthe entire plant [Fig. 7.7 (b)].\nPaheli says her mother puts\nladyfinger and other vegetables in\nwater if they are somewhat dry.\nShe wants to know how water\nenters into them.\nBoojho wants to know why\nplants absorb a large quantity\nof water from the soil, then give\nit off by transpiration!\nFig. 7.8 (a) Stem placed in coloured water\nDoes any part of the herb appear\nred? If yes, how do you think the colourreached there?\nYou can cut the stem across and look\nfor the red colour inside the stem(Fig. 7.8(b) and 7.8(c)).\nFrom this activity we see that water\nmoves up the stem. In other words, stemconducts water. Just like the red ink,minerals dissolved in water also move\nup the stem, along with water. Water\nand minerals go to leaves and otherplant parts, through narrow tubes\n(xylem) inside the stem (Fig. 7.7(b)).You know that leaves synthesise\nfood. The food has to be transported to\nall parts of the plant. This is done by\nthe vascular tissue called the phloem .\nThus, xylem and phloem transport\nsubstances in plants.\nActivity 7.3\nWe would require a glass tumbler, water,\nred ink, a tender herb (e.g., Balsam),\nand a blade for this activity.\nPour water to fill one-third of the\ntumbler. Add a few drops of red ink tothe water. Cut the base of the stem ofthe herb and place it in the glass as shown\nin Fig. 7.8(a). Observe it the next day.\nFig. 7.8 (b) Water moves up in the stem\n(c) Enlarged view of open end of stem(b) (c)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nTRANSPORTATION  IN ANIMALS  AND PLANTS 79\nWhat you have learnt\nIn most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food\nand oxygen to different cells of the body. It also carries waste productsfrom different parts of the body for excretion.\nCirculatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.\nIn humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart actsas a pumping organ.\nBlood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due tothe presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.\nThe human heart beats about 70–80 times per minute in an adultperson. This is called heart rate.\nArteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.\nVeins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.\nRemoval of waste products from the body is called excretion.Transpiration\nIn Class VI you learnt that plants\nrelease a lot of water by the process of\ntranspiration.\n Plants absorb mineral nutrients and\nwater from the soil. Not all the waterabsorbed is utilised by the plant. The water\nevaporates through the stomata presenton the surface of the leaves by the process\nof transpiration. The evaporation of waterfrom leaves generates a suction pull (the\nsame that you produce when you suck\nwater through a straw) which canpull water to great heights in the\ntall trees.

You have already\nlearnt this in Class VI. The production\nof new individuals from their parents is\nknown as reproduction. But, how do\nplants reproduce? There are different\nmodes of reproduction in plants which\nwe shall learn in this chapter.\n8.1 M ODES OF REPRODUCTION\nIn Class VI you learnt about different\nparts of a flowering plant. Try to list thevarious parts of a plant and write the\nfunctions of each. Most plants have\nroots, stems and leaves. These are calledthe vegetative parts  of a plant. After a\ncertain period of growth, most plantsbear flowers. You may have seen themango trees flowering in spring. It is\nthese flowers that give rise to juicy\nmango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat\nthe fruits and usually discard the seeds.\nSeeds germinate and form new plants.\nSo, what is the function of flowers in\nplants? Flowers perform the function of\nreproduction in plants. Flowers are the\nreproductive parts .\nThere are several ways by which\nplants produce their offspring. These are\ncategorised into two types: (i) asexual,\nand (ii) sexual reproduction. In asexual\nreproduction  plants can give rise to new\nplants without seeds, whereas in sexualAsexual reproduction\nIn asexual reproduction new plants are\nobtained without production of seeds.\nVegetative propagation\nIt is a type of asexual reproduction in\nwhich new plants are produced fromroots, stems, leaves and buds. Since\nreproduction is through the vegetative\nparts of the plant, it is known asvegetative propagation.\nActivity 8.1\nCut a branch of rose or champa with a\nnode. This piece of branch is termed a\ncutting. Bury the cutting in the soil. Anode is a part of the stem/branch at\nwhich a leaf arises (Fig. 8.1). Water the\ncutting every day and observe itsgrowth.

Plants produce seeds as a resultof sexual reproduction.\nBudding\nYou have already learnt about the tiny\norganisms like yeast can be seen only\nunder a microscope. These grow andmultiply every few hours if sufficient\nnutrients are made available to them.\nRemember that yeast is a single-celledorganism. Let us see how they\nreproduce?The small bulb-like projection\ncoming out from the yeast cell is calleda bud. The bud gradually grows and\ngets detached from the parent cell and\nforms a new yeast cell. The new yeast\ncell grows, matures and produces more\nyeast cells. Sometimes, another  budarises from the bud forming a chain of\nbuds. If this process continues, a large\nnumber of yeast cells are produced in ashort time.\nFragmentation\nYou might have seen slimy green\npatches in ponds, or in other stagnant\nwater bodies. These are the algae. When\nFig. 8.5  Reproduction in yeast by buddingYeast cellDeveloping budChain of buds\nNew budNew plants\nReprint 2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN PLANTS 85\nair. As they are very light they can cover\nlong distances.\nSpores are asexual reproductive\nbodies. Each spore is covered by ahard protective coat to withstandunfavourable conditions such as high\ntemperature and low humidity. So\nthey can survive for a long time. Underfavourable conditions, a spore\ngerminates and develops into a new\nindividual. Plants such as moss andferns (Fig. 8.8) also reproduce by means\nof spores.\n12.2 S EXUAL REPRODUCTION\nYou have learnt earlier the structure ofa flower. You know that the flowers are\nthe reproductive parts of a plant.Stamens  are the male reproductive part\nand pistil  is the female reproductive part\n(Fig. 8.9).water and nutrients are available algaegrow and multiply rapidly byfragmentation.

Some of\nthe pollen lands on the stigma of a flowerof the same kind. The transfer of pollen\nfrom the anther to the stigma of a flower\nis called pollination .  If the pollen lands\non the stigma of the same flower or\nanother flower of the same plant, it is\ncalled self-pollination. When the pollenof a flower lands on the stigma of a flower\nof a different plant of the same kind, it\nis called cross-pollination  [Fig. 8.10 (a)\nand (b)].\nFertilisation\nThe cell which results after fusion of\nthe gametes is called a zygote .

The\nseeds develop from the ovules. The seedcontains an embryo enclosed in a\nprotective seed coat.\nSome fruits are fleshy and juicy such\nas mango and orange. Some fruits arehard like almonds and walnuts\n[Fig. 8.12 (a) and (b)].\n8.4 S EED DISPERSAL\nIn nature same kind of plants grow atdifferent places. This happens because\nseeds are dispersed to different places .\nSometimes after a walk through a forest\nor a field or a park, you may have found\nseeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.Fig. 8.11  Fertilisation (Zygote formation)\nPollen grain (germinating)\nOvumZygote\nformation\nPollen tube\n(a)(b)(a)\n(b)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 88Did you try to observe how these seeds\nwere clinging to your clothes?\nWhat do you think will happen if all\nseeds of a plant were to fall at the sameplace and grow there? There would besevere competition for sunlight, water,\nminerals and space. As a result the seeds\nwould not grow into healthy plants.Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It\nprevents competition between the plant\nand its own seedlings for sunlight, waterand minerals. It also enables the plants\nto invade new habitats for wider\ndistribution.\nSeeds and fruits of plants are carried\naway by wind, water and animals.Winged seeds such as those of drumstickand maple [Fig. 8.13 (a) and (b)], lightseeds of grasses or hairy seeds of aak(Madar ) and hairy fruit of sunflower\n[Fig. 8.14 (a), (b)], get blown off with the\nwind to far away places. Some seeds are\ndispersed by water. These fruits or seedsusually develop floating ability in the\nform of spongy or fibrous outer coat as\nin coconut. Some seeds are dispersed byanimals, especially spiny seeds with\nhooks which get attached to the bodies\nof animals and are carried to distantplaces. Examples are Xanthium\n(Fig. 8.15) and Urena .\nSome seeds are dispersed when the\nfruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds\nare scattered far from the parent plant.\nThis happens in the case of castor andbalsam.\nFig. 8.13  Seeds of (a) drumstick and\n(b) maple\nFig. 8.15  XanthiumFig. 8.14  (a) The hairy fruit of sunflower and\n(b) hairy seed of madar (aak)\nSeed\nWing\n(a) (b) (a) (b)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN PLANTS 89\nWhat you have learnt\nAll organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.\nIn plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.\nThere are several methods of asexual reproduction such as\nfragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.\nSexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.\nIn vegetative propagation new plants are produced from differentvegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.\nFlower is the reproductive part of a plant.\nA flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductiveparts.\nA bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.\nThe male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametesare found in the ovule.\nPollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther ofone flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.\nPollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. Inself-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to thestigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains aretransferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flowerof the same kind.\nPollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.\nThe fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.\nFertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.\nFruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, whichcontains the developing embryo.\nSeed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.\nSeed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoidcompetition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.Keywords\nAsexual reproduction\nBuddingEmbryoFertilisationFragmentationGametesHyphaOvulePollen grainPollen tubePollinationSeed dispersalSexual reproductionSporeSporangiumVegetative propagationZygote\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 90Exercises\n1.

{"class": "7", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 9: motion and time", "content": "Motion and Time9\nIn Class VI, you learnt about different\ntypes of motions. You learnt that a\nmotion could be along a straight line,\nit could be circular or periodic. Can you\nrecall these three types of motions?\nTable 9.1 gives some common\nexamples of motions. Identify the typeof motion in each case.9.1 S LOW OR FAST\nWe know that some vehicles move fasterthan others. Even the same vehicle maymove faster or slower at different times.\nMake a list of ten objects moving along\na straight path. Group the motion ofthese objects as slow and fast. How did\nyou decide which object is moving slow\nand which one is moving fast?\nIf vehicles are moving on a road in\nthe same direction, we can easily tellwhich one of them is moving faster thanthe other. Let us look at the motion of\nvehicles moving on a road.\nActivity 9.1\nLook at Fig. 9.1. It shows the position\nof some vehicles moving on a road inthe same direction at some instant of\ntime. Now look at Fig. 9.2. It shows the\nposition of the same vehicles after sometime. From your observation of the two\nfigures, answer the following questions:\nWhich vehicle is moving the fastest\nof all? Which one of them is moving theslowest of all?\nThe distance moved by objects in a\ngiven interval of time can help us todecide which one is faster or slower. For\nexample, imagine that you have gone tosee off your friend at the bus stand.\nSuppose you start pedalling your bicycle\nat the same time as the bus begins toTable 9.1 Some examples of\ndifferent types of motion\nExample of Type of motion\nmotion Along a straight\nline/circular/\nperiodic\nSoldiers in a\nmarch past\nBullock cart\nmoving on a\nstraight road\nHands of an\nathlete in a race\nPedal of a bicycle\nin motion\nMotion of the Earth\naround the Sun\nMotion of a swing\nMotion  of a\npendulum\nIt is common experience that the\nmotion of some objects is slow while that\nof some others is fast.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 93move. The distance covered by you after\n5 minutes would be much smaller thanthat covered by the bus. Would you say\nthat the bus is moving faster than the\nbicycle?\nWe often say that the faster vehicle\nhas a higher speed.  In a 100-metre raceit is easy to decide whose speedis the highest. One who takesshortest time to cover the\ndistance of 100 metres has the\nhighest speed.\n9.2 S PEED\nYou are probably familiar withthe word speed. In theexamples given above, a higher\nspeed seems to indicate that a\ngiven distance has beencovered in a shorter time, or a\nlarger distance covered in a\ngiven time.\nThe most convenient way to\nfind out which of the two ormore objects is moving fasteris to compare the distances\nmoved by them in a unit time.\nThus, if we know the distancecovered by two buses in one\nhour, we can tell which one is\nfaster. We call the distancecovered by an object in a unit\ntime as the speed  of the object.\nWhen we say that a car is\nmoving with a speed of 50kilometres per hour, it implies\nthat it will cover a distance of\nFig. 9.2  Position of vehicles shown in\nFig. 9.1 after some timeFig. 9.1  Vehicles moving in the same\ndirection on a road\n50 kilometres in one hour. However, a\ncar seldom moves with a constant speed\nfor one hour. In fact, it starts movingslowly and then picks up speed. So,\nwhen we say that the car has a speed of\n50 kilometres per hour, we usuallyconsider only the total distance covered\nby it in one hour. We do not bother\nwhether the car has been moving with\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 94We can determine the speed of a given\nobject once we can measure the time\ntaken by it to cover a certain distance.\nIn Class VI you learnt how to measuredistances. But, how do we measure\ntime? Let us find out.\n9.3 M EASUREMENT  OF TIME\nIf you did not have a clock, how wouldyou decide what time of the day it is?\nHave you ever wondered how our elderscould tell the approximate time of the\nday by just looking at shadows?\nHow do we measure time interval of\na month? A year?\nOur ancestors noticed that many\nevents in nature repeat themselves after\ndefinite intervals of time. For example,they found that the sun rises everydayin the morning. The time between onesunrise and the next was called a day.\nSimilarly, a month was measured from\none new moon to the next. A year wasfixed as the time taken by the earth to\ncomplete one revolution of the sun.\nOften we need to measure intervals\nof time which are much shorter than aday. Clocks or watches are perhaps the\nmost common time measuring devices.Have you ever wondered how clocks and\nwatches measure time?\nThe working of clocks is rather\ncomplex. But all of them make use ofsome periodic motion. One of the most\nwell-known periodic motions is that ofa simple pendulum.\nIn everyday life we seldom find objects\nmoving with a constant speed over long\ndistances or for long durations of time.If the speed of an object moving along\na straight line keeps changing, its\nmotion is said to be non-uniform. On\nthe other hand, an object moving along\na straight line with a constant speed\nis said to be in uniform motion . In\nthis case, the average speed is the\nsame as the actual speed.\nFig. 9.3  Some common clocks(b) Table clock\n(c) Digital clock(a) Wall clock\na constant speed or not during that\nhour. The speed calculated here isactually the average speed of the car. In\nthis book we shall use the term speed\nfor average speed. So, for us the speed\nis the total distance covered divided\nby the total time taken . Thus,\nTotal distance coveredSpeed = Total time taken\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 95A simple pendulum consists of a\nsmall metallic ball or a piece of stone\nsuspended from a rigid stand by athread [Fig. 9.4 (a)]. The metallic ball is\ncalled the bob of the pendulum.\nFig. 9.4 (a) shows the pendulum at\nrest in its mean position. When the bobof the pendulum is released after taking\nit slightly to one side, it begins to moveto and fro [Fig. 9.4 (b)]. The to and fro\nmotion of a simple pendulum is an\nexample of a periodic or an oscillatorymotion.\nThe pendulum is said to have\ncompleted one oscillation  when its bob,\nstarting from its mean position O, movesTo set the pendulum in motion,\ngently hold the bob and move it slightly\nto one side. Make sure that the string\nattached to the bob is taut while youdisplace it. Now release the bob from its\ndisplaced position. Remember that the\nbob is not to be pushed when it isreleased. Note the time on the clock\nwhen the bob is at its mean position.\nInstead of the mean position you maynote the time when the bob is at one of\nits extreme positions. Measure the time\nthe pendulum takes to complete 20oscillations. Record your observationsFig. 9.4  (b) Different\npositions of the bob of an\noscillating simple pendulumFig. 9.4  (a) A simple\npendulumto A, to B and back to O. Thependulum also completes oneoscillation when its bob moves\nfrom one extreme position A to the\nother extreme position B andcomes back to A. The time taken\nby the pendulum to complete one\noscillation is called its time\nperiod .\nActivity 9.2\nSet up a simple pendulum as\nshown in Fig. 9.4 (a) with a\nthread or string of length nearlyone metre. Switch off any fans\nnearby. Let the bob of the\npendulum come to rest at itsmean position. Mark the mean\nposition of the bob on the floor\nbelow it or on the wall behind it.\nTo measure the time period of\nthe pendulum we will needa stopwatch. However, if astopwatch is not available, a table\nclock or a wristwatch can be used.A\nOB\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 96Table 9.2 Time period of a simple\npendulum\nLength of the string = 100 cm\nS.No. Time taken for 20 Time period\noscillations (s) (s)\n1. 42 2.1\n2.\n3.cells. These clocks are called quartz\nclocks. The time measured by quartzclocks is much more accurate than that\nby the clocks available earlier.\nUnits of time and speed\nThe basic unit of time is a second. Its\nsymbol is s. Larger units of time are\nminutes (min) and hours (h). Youalready know how these units are related\nto one another.\nWhat would be the basic unit of\nspeed?\nSince the speed is distance/time, the\nbasic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it\ncould also be expressed in other units\nsuch as m/min or km/h.\nYou must remember that the\nsymbols of all units are written insingular . For example, we write 50 km\nand not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms.\nBoojho is wondering how many\nseconds there are in a day and how\nmany hours in a year. Can you helphim?in Table 9.2. The first observation shownis just a sample. Your observations couldbe different from this. Repeat this\nactivity a few times and record your\nobservations. By dividing the time takenfor 20 oscillations by 20, get the time\ntaken for one oscillation, or the time\nperiod of the pendulum.\nIs the time period of your pendulum\nnearly the same in all cases?\nNote that a slight change in the\ninitial displacement does not affect the\ntime period of your pendulum.\nNowadays most clocks or watches\nhave an electric circuit with one or more\nThere is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a givenpendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist\nGalileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 –1642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in achurch. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was\nmoving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his\npulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lampcompleted one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to\nverify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always\nthe same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to thedevelopment of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were\nrefinements of the pendulum clocks.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 97Different units of time are used\ndepending on the need.  For example, it\nis convenient to express your age in\nyears rather than in days or hours.\nSimilarly, it will not be wise to expressin years the time taken by you to cover\nthe distance between your home and\nyour school.\nHow small or large is a time interval\nof one second? The time taken in sayingaloud “two thousand and one” is nearbyone second. Verify it by counting aloud\nfrom “two thousand and one” to “two\nthousand and ten”. The pulse of anormal healthy adult at rest beats about\n72 times in a minute that is about 12\ntimes in 10 seconds.  This rate may beslightly higher for children.\nPaheli wondered how time was\nmeasured when pendulum\nclocks were not available.\nMany time measuring devices were\nused in different parts of the world beforethe pendulum clocks became popular.\nSundials, water clocks and sand clocks\nare some examples of such devices.Different designs of these devices were\ndeveloped in different parts of the world\n(Fig. 9.5).\n9.4 M EASURING  SPEED\nHaving learnt how to measure time anddistance, you can calculate the speed ofan object. Let us find the speed of a ball\nmoving along the ground.\nActivity 9.3\nDraw a straight line on the ground with\nchalk powder or lime and ask one of\nyour friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from\nit. Let your friend gently roll a ball alongthe ground in a direction perpendicular\nto the line. Note the time at the moment\nthe ball crosses the line and also whenit comes to rest (Fig. 9.6). How much\ntime does the ball take to come to rest?\nThe smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly availableclocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available\nthat can measure time intervals smaller than a second.  Some of these clockscan measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a\nsecond. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond.\nOne microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionthof a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific\nresearch. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals\nthat are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times ofhistorical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of\nstars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the\nrange of time intervals that we have to deal with?\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 98Measure the distance between the point\nat which the ball crosses the line and\nthe point where it comes to rest. Youcan use a scale or a measuring\ntape. Let different groups repeat the\nactivity. Record the measurements inTable 9.3. In each case calculate the\nspeed of the ball.\nYou may now like to compare your\nspeed of walking or cycling with that ofyour friends. You need to know the\ndistance of the school from your homeor from some other point. Each one of\nyou can then measure the time taken\nto cover that distance and calculate yourspeed. It may be interesting to know who\namongst you is the fastest. Speeds of\nsome living organisms are given in\nFig. 9.6  Measuring the speed of a ball(a) Sundial at Jantar Mantar, Delhi(b) Sand clock\n(c) Water clock\nFig. 9.5  Some ancient time-measuring devices\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 99Table 9.3 Distance moved and time taken by a moving ball\nName of the group Distance moved by Time taken (s) Speed = Distance/\nthe ball (m) Time taken (m/s)\nBoojho wants to know\nwhether there is any device\nthat measures the speed.\nTable 9.4, in km/h. You can calculate\nthe speeds in m/s yourself.\nRockets, launching satellites into\nearth’s orbit, often attain speeds up to8 km/s. On the other hand, a tortoise\ncan move only with a speed of about 8\ncm/s. Can you calculate how fast is therocket compared with the tortoise?\nOnce you know the speed of an\nobject, you can find the distance movedby it in a given time. All you have to do\nis to multiply the speed by time. Thus,\nDistance covered = Speed × Time\nYou can also find the time an object\nwould take to cover a distance while\nmoving with a given speed.You might have seen a meter fitted\non top of a scooter or a motorcycle.Similarly, meters can be seen on the\ndashboards of cars, buses and other\nvehicles. Fig. 9.7 shows the dashboardof a car. Note that one of the meters has\nkm/h written at one corner. This is\ncalled a speedometer .

Can you calculatethe speed of the bus? Looking at theTable, Boojho asked Paheli whether she\ncan tell how far they would have\ntravelled till 9:45 AM. Paheli had noanswer to this question. They went to\ntheir teacher. She told them that one\nway to solve this problem is to plot adistance-time graph.

Draw\ntwo lines perpendicular to each other\non it, as shown in Fig. 9.11. Mark the\nhorizontal line as XOX'. It is known asthe x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical\nline YOY '. It is called the y-axis. The point\nof intersection of XOX ' and YOY ' is\nknown as the origin O. The twoquantities between which the graph is\ndrawn are shown along these two axes.We show the positive values on the\nx-axis along OX. Similarly, positive\nvalues on the y-axis are shown alongOY. In this chapter we shall consider\nonly the positive values of quantities.Therefore, we shall use only the shadedpart of the graph shown in Fig. 9.11.\nBoojho and Paheli found out the\ndistance travelled by a car and the timetaken by it to cover that distance. Their\ndata is shown in Table 9.6.\n2468 10 12 14 16 18 20 2220\n10304050607080Weight (in kg)\nAge (in year)X O X\nYY\nYou can make the graph by following\nthe steps given below:\nDraw two perpendicular lines to\nrepresent the two axes and markthem as OX and OY as in Fig. 9.11.\nDecide the quantity to be shownalong the x-axis and that to beshown along the y-axis. In this caseY\nXOther gases Oxygen\nNitrogen\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 102we show the time along the x-axis\nand the distance along the y-axis.\nChoose a scale to represent thedistance and another to representthe time on the graph. For the motionof the car scales could be\nTime: 1 min = 1 cm\nDistance: 1 km = 1 cm\nMark values for the time and thedistance on the respective axes\naccording to the scale you have\nchosen. For the motion of the carmark the time 1 min, 2 min, … onthe x-axis from the origin O.\nSimilarly, mark the distance 1 km,\n2 km … on the y-axis (Fig. 9.12).\nNow you have to mark the points onthe graph paper to represent each\nset of values for distance and time.\nObservation recorded at S. No. 1in Table 9.6 shows that at time0 min the distance moved is also\nzero. The point corresponding to this\nset of values on the graph willtherefore be the origin itself. After 1minute, the car has moved a distance\nof 1 km. To mark this set of values\nlook for the point that represents1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a lineparallel to the y-axis at this point.\nThen draw a line parallel to the\nx-axis from the point correspondingto distance 1 km on the y-axis. Thepoint where these two lines\nintersect represents this set of values\non the graph (Fig. 9.12). Similarly,mark on the graph paper thepoints corresponding to different\nsets of values.Fig. 9.12 shows the set of points onthe graph corresponding to positions\nof the car at various times.\nJoin all the points on the graph as\nshown in Fig. 9.13. It is a straight\nline. This is the distance-time graph\nfor the motion of the car.\nIf the distance-time graph is a\nstraight line, it indicates that the\nobject is moving with a constantspeed. However, if the speed of the\nobject keeps changing, the graph can\nbe of any other shape.Fig. 9.12  Making a graph\nFig. 9.13  Making a graphOXY\nXO\nY\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 103Generally, the choice of scales is not\nas simple as in the example given in\nFig. 9.12 and 9.13. We may have to\nchoose two different scales to represent\nthe desired quantities on the x-axis and\nthe y-axis. Let us try to understand this\nprocess with an example.\nLet us again consider the motion of\nthe bus that took Paheli and her friends\nto the picnic. The distance covered and\ntime taken by the bus are shown inTable 9.5. The total distance covered bythe bus is 80 km. If we decide to choose\na scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall have to\ndraw an axis of length 80 cm. This isnot possible on a sheet of paper. On theother hand, a scale 10 km = 1 cm would\nrequire an axis of length only 8 cm. This\nscale is quite convenient. However, thegraph may cover only a small part ofthe graph paper.  Some of the points to\nbe kept in mind while choosing\nthe most suitable scale for drawing a\ngraph are:the difference between the highest\nand the lowest values of eachquantity.\nthe intermediate values of eachquantity, so that with the scalechosen it is convenient to mark the\nvalues on the graph, and\nto utilise the maximum part of the\npaper on which the graph is to be\ndrawn.\nSuppose that you are given a graph\npaper of size 25 cm  × 25 cm. One of the\nscales which meets the above conditionsand can accommodate the data of Table9.5 could be\nDistance: 5 km = 1 cm, andTime: 6 min = 1 cmCan you now draw the distance-time\ngraph for the motion of the bus? Is thegraph drawn by you similar to thatshown in Fig. 9.13?\nDistance-time graphs provide a\nvariety of information about the motionFig. 9.14  Distance-time graph of the busY\nX\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 104when compared to the data presented\nby a table. For example, Table 9.5 givesinformation about the distance moved\nby the bus only at some definite time\nintervals. On the other hand, from thedistance-time graph we can find the\ndistance moved by the bus at any\ninstant of time. Suppose we want toknow how much distance the bus had\ntravelled at 8:15  AM. We mark the point\ncorresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on\nthe x-axis (Fig. 9.14). Suppose this point\nis A.  Next we draw a line perpendicular\nto the x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) atpoint A. We then mark the point, T, onthe graph at which this perpendicularline intersects it (Fig. 9.14). Next, we\ndraw a line through the point T parallel\nto the x-axis. This intersects the y-axisat the point B. The distance\ncorresponding to the point B on the y-\naxis, OB, gives us the distance in kmcovered by the bus at 8:15  AM. How\nmuch is this distance in km? Can younow help Paheli to find the distancemoved by the bus at 9:45  AM? Can you\nalso find the speed of the bus from itsdistance-time graph?\nBar graph\nGraphsNon-uniform motionKeywords\nOscillationSimple pendulumSpeedTime periodUniform motionUnit of time\nWhat you have Learnt\nThe distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its speed.\nSpeed of objects help us to decide which one is moving faster than the\nother.\nThe speed of an object is the distance travelled divided by the time takento cover that distance. Its basic unit is metre per second (m/s).\nPeriodic events are used for the measurement of time.

You can make your own sundial and use it to mark the time of the day\nat your place. First of all find the latitude of your city with the help of an\natlas. Cut out a triangular piece of a cardboard such that its one angleis equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is aright angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon , vertically along a diameter of\na circular board a shown in Fig. 9.16. One way to fix the gnomon couldbe to make a groove along a diameter on the circular board.\nNext, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day.\nMark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place thesundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 9.16.  Mark the position of the tip ofthe shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day aspossible, say 8:00 AM . Mark the position of the tip of the shadow every\nhour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked byyou with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 9.16.Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery. You can usethis sundial to read the time of the day at your place. Remember thatthe gnomon should always be placed in the North-South direction asshown in Fig. 9.16.\nFig. 9.16(iii) (iv)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 108Did you know?\nThe time-keeping services in India are provided by the National Physical\nLaboratory, New Delhi.

Suppose a car uses 4 litres of petrol to travel a distance of\n60 km. How far will it travel using 12 litres? The answer is 180 km. How did we calculate\nit? Since petrol consumed in the second instance is 12 litres, i.e., three times of 4 litres, the\ndistance travelled will also be three times of 60 km. In other words, when the petrolconsumption becomes three-fold, the distance travelled is also three fold the previousone. Let the consumption of petrol be x litres and the corresponding distance travelled be\ny km . Now , complete the following table:\nPetrol in litres ( x)4 8 12 15 20 25\nDistance in km (y )60 ... 180 ... ... ...\nWe find that as the value of x increases, value of y also increa ses in such a way that  the\nratio x\ny does not change;  it remains constant (say k). In this case, it is 1\n15 (check it!).\nWe say that x and y are in dir ect pr oportion , if  =xky or x = ky.\nIn this example, 4 12\n60 180= , where 4 and 12 are the quantities of petrol consumed in\nlitres (x ) and 60 and 180 are the distances ( y) in km. So when x and y are in direct\nproportion , we can write 12\n12xx\nyy= . [y1, y2 are values of y corresponding to the values x1,\nx2 of x respectively]\nThe consumption of petrol and the distance travelled by a car is a case of direct\nproportion.

A scale is\nusually given at the bottom of the map. The scale shows a relationship between\nactual length and the length represented on the map. The scale of  the map is thus theratio of the distance between two points on the map to the actual distance betweentwo points on the large region.\nFor example, if 1 cm on the map represents 8 km of actual distance [i.e., the scale is\n1 cm :  8 km or 1 : 800,000] then 2 cm on the same map will represent 16 km.Hence, we can say that scale of a map is based on the concept of direct proportion.\nExample 5: The scale of a map is given as 1:30000000. Two cities are 4 cm apart on\nthe map.

Do you think that\nthey can be solved by ‘unitary method’?\n11.3 Inverse Proportion\nTwo quantities may change in such a manner that if one quantity increases, the otherquantity decreases and vice versa. For example, as the number of workers increases, timetaken to finish the job decreases. Similarly, if we increase the speed, the time taken tocover a given distance decreases.To understand this, let us look into the following situation.\nZaheeda can go to her school in four different ways. She can walk, run, cycle or go by\ncar. Study the following table.\nReprint 2024-25\n\n\nObserve that as the speed increases, time taken to cover the same distance decreases.\nAs Zaheeda doubles her speed by running, time\nreduces to half. As she increases her speed to three\ntimes by cycling, time decreases to one third.Similarly , as she increases her speed to 15 times,\ntime decreases to one fifteenth. (Or, in other wordsthe ratio by which time decreases is inverse of theratio by which the corresponding speed increases).Can we say that speed and time change inverselyin proportion?\nLet us consider another example. A school wants to spend \n 6000 on mathematics\ntextbooks. How many books could be bought at  40 each? Clearly 150 books can be\nbought. If the price of a textbook is more than  40, then the number of books which\ncould be purchased with the same amount of money would be less than 150. Observe thefollowing table.\nPrice of each book (in ) 40 50 60 75 80 100\nNumber of books that 150 120 100 80 75 60\ncan be bought\nWhat do you observe? You will appreciate that as the price of the books increases,\nthe number of books that can be bought, keeping the fund constant, will decrease.\nRatio by which the price of books increases when going from 40 to 50 is 4 : 5, and the\nratio by which the corresponding number of books decreases from 150 to 120 is 5 : 4.This means that the two ratios are inverses of each other .\nNotice that the product of the corresponding values of the two quantities is constant;\nthat is, 40 × 150 = 50 × 120 = 6000.\n If we represent the price of  one book as x and the number of  books bought as y, then\nas x increases y decreases and vice-versa. It is important to note that the product xy\nremains constant. We say that x varies inversely with y and y varies inversely with x. Thus\ntwo quantities x and y are said to vary in inverse pr opor tion, if ther e exists a relation\nof the type xy = k between them, k being a constant. If y\n1, y2 are the values of y\ncorresponding to the values x1, x2 of x respectively then  x1y1 = x2y2 (= k), or 12\n21xy\nxy= .\nWe say that x and y are in inverse pr opor tion.\nHence, in this example, cost of a book and number of books purchased in a fixed\namount are inversely proportional. Similarly, speed of a vehicle and the time taken tocover a fixed distance changes in inverse proportion.\nThink of more such examples of pairs of quantities that vary in inverse proportion.

Thus, we have\nthe following table.\nNumber of pipes 6 5\nTime (in minutes) 80 x\nLesser the number of pipes, more will be the time required by\nit to fill the tank.

{"class": "8", "subject": "math", "chapter": "Chapter 12: factorisation", "content": "FACTORISATION   145\n12.1  Introduction\n12.1.1   Factors of natural numbers\nYou will remember what you learnt about factors in Class VI. Let us take a natural number ,\nsay 30, and write it as a product of other natural numbers, say\n 30 = 2 × 15\n=3 × 10 = 5 × 6\nThus, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 and 30 are the factors of 30.\nOf these, 2, 3 and 5 are the prime factors of 30 (Why?)\nA number written as a product of prime factors is said to\nbe in the prime factor form; for example, 30 written as\n2 × 3 × 5 is in the prime factor form.\nThe prime factor form of 70 is 2 × 5 × 7.\nThe prime factor form of 90 is 2 × 3 × 3 × 5, and so on.\nSimilarly , we can express algebraic expressions as products of their factors.  This is\nwhat we shall learn to do in this chapter .\n12.1.2  Factors of algebraic expressions\nWe have seen in Class VII that in algebraic expressions, terms are formed as products of\nfactors. For example, in the algebraic expression 5 xy + 3x the term 5 xy has been formed\nby the factors 5, x and y\n, i.e.,\n5xy = y x××5\nObserve that the factors 5, x and y of 5xy cannot further\nbe expressed as a product of factors. We may say that 5,\nx and y  are ‘prime’  factors of 5 xy.  In algebraic expressions,\nwe use the word ‘irreducible’  in place of ‘prime’.  We say that\n5 × x × y is the irreducible form of 5 xy.  Note 5 × ( xy) is not\nan irreducible form of  5 xy, since the factor xy can be further\nexpressed as a product o f x and y, i.e., \nxy = x × y.FactorisationCHAPTER\n12\nNote 1 is a factor of 5 xy, since\n5xy = y x×××5 1\nIn fact, 1 is a factor of every term. As\nin the case of natural numbers, unless\nit is specially required, we do not show\n1 as a separate factor of any term.We know that 30 can also be written as\n30 = 1 × 30\nThus, 1 and 30 are also factors of 30.\nYou will notice that 1 is a factor of any\nnumber .  For example, 101 = 1 × 101.\nHowever , when we write a number as a\nproduct of factors, we shall not write 1 as\na factor , unless it is specially required.\nReprint 2024-25\n\n146  MATHEMA TICS\nNext consider the expression 3x  (x + 2).  It can be written as a product of factors.\n3, x and ( x + 2)\n3x(x + 2) = ( )2 3+ × ×x x\nThe factors 3, x and ( x +2) are irreducible factors of 3 x (x + 2).\nSimilarly , the expression 10 x (x + 2) ( y + 3) is expressed in its irreducible factor form\nas  10 x (x + 2) ( y + 3) = ( )( ) 2 5 2 3 x x y × × × + × + .\n12.2  What is Factorisation?\nWhen we factorise an algebraic expression, we write it as a product of factors.  These\nfactors may be numbers, algebraic variables or algebraic expressions.\nExpressions like 3 xy, y x25 , 2x (y  + 2), 5 ( y + 1) ( x + 2) are already in factor form.\nTheir factors can be just read of f from them, as we already know .\nOn the other hand consider expressions like 2x + 4, 3 x + 3y , x2 + 5x, x2 + 5x  + 6.\nIt is not obvious what their factors are. We need to develop systematic methods to factorise\nthese expressions, i.e., to find their factors. This is what we shall do now .\n12.2.1  Method of common factors\n•We begin with a simple example: Factorise 2 x + 4.\nWe shall write each term as a product of irreducible factors;\n2x =2 × x\n4 =2 × 2\nHence 2x + 4 =(2 × x) + (2 × 2)\nNotice that factor 2 is common to both the terms.\nObserve, by distributive law\n2 × (x  + 2) = (2 × x) + (2 × 2)\nTherefore, we can write\n2x + 4 = 2 × (x  + 2) = 2 ( x + 2)\nThus, the expression 2 x + 4 is the same as 2 ( x + 2).  Now we can read off its factors:\nthey are 2 and ( x + 2). These factors are irreducible.\nNext, factorise 5xy  + 10 x.\nThe irreducible factor forms of 5 xy and 10 x are respectively ,\n5xy =5 × x × y\n10x =2 × 5  × x\nObserve that the two terms have 5 and x as common factors.  Now ,\n5xy + 10 x =(5 × x × y )  + (5 × x × 2)\n=(5x × y )  + (5x × 2)\nWe combine the two terms using the distributive law ,\n(5x× y)  + (5x× 2) = 5x × ( y + 2)\nTherefore, 5 xy + 10x = 5 x (y + 2). (This is the desired factor form.)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFACTORISATION   147\nTRY THESEExample 1: Factorise  12 a2b + 15 ab2\nSolution:  \nWe have 12a2b =2 × 2 × 3 × a × a × b\n15ab2 =3 × 5 × a × b × b\nThe two terms have 3, a and b as common factors.\nTherefore, 12a2b + 15 ab2 =(3 × a × b × 2 × 2  × a) + (3 × a × b × 5 × b )\n=3 × a × b × [(2 × 2 × a) + (5 × b)]\n =3ab × (4 a + 5 b)\n= 3ab (4a + 5b\n) (required factor form)\nExample 2:  Factorise 10x2 – 18 x3 + 14x4\nSolution: 10x2 =2 × 5 × x  × x\n        18x3  =2 × 3 × 3 × x × x × x\n       14 x4 =2 × 7 × x  × x × x × x\nThe common factors of the three terms are 2, x and x.\nTherefore, 10x2 – 18 x3 + 14 x4 =(2 × x × x × 5) – (2 × x  × x × 3 × 3 ×  x)\n+ (2 × x × x × 7 × x × x)\n=2 × x × x ×[(5 – (3 × 3 × x) + (7 × x × x)]\n=2x2  ×  (5 – 9x + 7x2) = 2 22 (7 9 5)x x x − +         \nFactorise: (i)  12 x + 36 (ii)  22y  – 33 z(iii)  14 pq + 35 pqr\n12.2.2  Factorisation by regrouping terms\nLook at the expression 2 xy + 2y + 3x\n + 3.  You will notice that the first two terms have\ncommon factors 2 and y and the last two terms have a common factor 3.  But there is no\nsingle factor common to all the terms.  How shall we proceed?\nLet us write (2 xy + 2y) in the factor form:\n2xy + 2y =(2 × x × y) + (2 × y)\n=(2 × y × x) + (2 × y  × 1)\n=(2y × x) + (2y  × 1) = 2y  (x + 1)\nSimilarly ,      3x + 3 = (3 × x) + (3 × 1)\n=3 × (x  + 1) = 3 ( x  + 1)\nHence, 2xy + 2y + 3x + 3 = 2y (x + 1) + 3 (x  +1)\nObserve, now we have a common factor ( x + 1) in both the terms on the right hand\nside. Combining the two terms,\n2xy + 2y + 3x + 3 = 2 y (x + 1) + 3 ( x + 1) = ( x + 1) (2 y + 3)\nThe expression 2xy  + 2y + 3x + 3 is now in the form of a product of factors. Its\nfactors are ( x + 1) and (2 y + 3). Note, these factors are irreducible.Note, we need to\nshow1 as a factor\nhere. Why?Do you notice that the factor\nform of an expression has only\none term?(combining the three terms)(combining the terms)\nReprint 2024-25\n\n148  MATHEMA TICS\nWhat is regrouping?\nSuppose, the above expression was given as 2 xy + 3 + 2 y + 3x; then it will not be easy to\nsee the factorisation. Rearranging the expression, as 2 xy + 2y + 3x + 3, allows us to form\ngroups (2 xy + 2y) and (3 x + 3) leading to factorisation. This is regrouping.\nRegrouping may be possible in more than one ways. Suppose, we regroup the\nexpression as:  2xy + 3x + 2y + 3. This will also lead to factors. Let us try:\n2xy + 3x + 2y + 3 = 2 × x × y + 3 × x + 2 × y + 3\n=x × (2y + 3) + 1 × (2 y + 3)\n           = (2y + 3) (\nx + 1)\nThe factors are the same (as they have to be), although they appear in dif ferent order .\nExample 3:  Factorise  6 xy – 4y + 6 – 9 x.\nSolution:\nStep 1 Check if there is a common factor among all terms.  There is none.\nStep 2 Think of grouping.  Notice that first two terms have a common factor 2 y;\n6xy – 4y =2y (3x – 2) (a)\nWhat about the last two terms? Observe them.  If you change their order to\n– 9x + 6, the factor ( 3x – 2) will come out;\n–9x + 6 = –3 (3x ) + 3 (2)\n=– 3 (3 x – 2) (b)\nStep 3 Putting (a) and (b) together ,\n6xy – 4y + 6 – 9 x =6xy – 4y – 9x + 6\n= 2y (3x – 2) – 3 (3 x – 2)\n=(3x – 2) (2 y – 3)\nThe factors of (6 xy – 4y + 6 – 9\n x) are (3 x – 2) and (2 y – 3).\nEXERCISE 12.1\n1.Find the common factors of the given terms.\n(i)12x, 36 (ii)2y, 22xy (iii) 14 pq, 28p2q2\n(iv) 2x, 3x2, 4 (v)6 abc, 24ab2, 12 a2b\n(vi) 16 x3, – 4x2, 32x (vii) 10 pq, 20 qr, 30rp\n(viii) 3x2 y3, 10x3 y2,6 x2 y2z\n2.Factorise the  following expressions.\n(i)7x – 42 (ii)6p – 12q (iii) 7a2 + 14 a\n(iv) – 16 z + 20 z3(v)20 l2 m + 30 a l m\n(vi) 5 x2 y – 15 xy2(vii) 10 a2 – 15  b2 + 20 c2\n(viii) – 4 a2 + 4 ab – 4 ca (ix) x2 y z +  x y2z + x y z2\n(x)a x2 y + b x y2 + c x y z\n3.Factorise.\n(i)x2 +  x y + 8x + 8y (ii)15 xy  – 6x + 5y – 2\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFACTORISATION   149\n(iii) ax + bx – ay – by (iv) 15 pq  + 15 + 9 q + 25 p\n(v)z – 7 + 7 x y – x y z\n12.2.3  Factorisation using identities\nWe know that (a + b )2  =a2 + 2ab + b2(I)\n(a – b )2  =a2 – 2ab\n + b2(II)\n(a + b) ( a – b)  = a2 – b2(III)\nThe following solved examples illustrate how to use these identities for factorisation. What\nwe do is to observe the given expression. If it has a form that fits the right hand side of one\nof the identities, then the expression corresponding to the left hand side of the identity\ngives the desired factorisation.\nExample 4:  Factorise x2 + 8x + 16\nSolution:  Observe the expression; it has three terms. Therefore, it does not fit\nIdentity III. Also, it’ s first and third terms are perfect squares with a positive sign before\nthe middle term. So, it is of the form a2 + 2ab + b2 where  a = x and b = 4\nsuch that a2 + 2ab + b2 = x2 + 2 ( x) (4) + 42\n=x2 + 8x + 16\nSince a2 + 2ab + b2 =(a + b)2,\nby comparison x2 + 8x + 16 = ( x + 4)2    (the required factorisation)\nExample 5:  Factorise 4 y2 – 12y + 9\nSolution:  Observe 4 y2 = (2 y)2, 9 = 32 and 12 y = 2 × 3 × (2y )\nTherefore, 4y2 – 12y + 9 = (2y)2 – 2 × 3 × (2y ) + (3)2\n=( 2y – 3)2(required factorisation)\nExample 6:  Factorise  49p2 – 36\nSolution:  There are two terms; both are squares and the second is negative. The\nexpression is of the form ( a2 – b2). Identity III is applicable here;\n   49p2  – 36 = (7p)2 – ( 6 )2\n=(7p – 6 ) ( 7 p + 6) (required factorisation)\nExample 7:  Factorise a2 – 2ab + b2 – c2\nSolution:  The first three terms of the given expression form ( a – b)2.  The fourth term\nis a square.  So the expression can be reduced to a difference of two squares.\nThus, a2 – 2ab + b2 – c2 =(a – b )2– c2(Applying Identity II)\n      = [(a – b) – c) ((a – b) + c)] (Applying Identity III)\n= (a – b – c) (a – b\n + c) (required factorisation)\nNotice, how we applied two identities one after the other to obtain the required factorisation.\nExample 8:  Factorise   m4 – 256\nSolution:  We note m4 = (m2)2 and 256 = (16) 2Observe here the given\nexpression is of the form\na2 – 2ab + b2.\nWhere a = 2y, and b = 3\nwith 2 ab = 2 × 2 y × 3 = 12 y.\nReprint 2024-25\n\n150  MATHEMA TICS\nThus, the given expression fits Identity III.\nTherefore, m4 – 256 = (m2)2 – (16) 2\n=\n(m2 –16) (m2 +16) [(using Identity (III)]\nNow, (m2 + 16) cannot be factorised further , but ( m2 –16) is factorisable again as per\nIdentity III.\nm2–16 = m2 – 42\n= (m – 4) ( m + 4)\nTherefore, m4 – 256 = (m – 4) ( m + 4)  ( m2 +16)\n12.2.4  Factors of  the form ( x xx xx + aaa aa) ( x xx xx + b bb bb)\nLet us now discuss how we can factorise expressions in one variable, like x2 + 5x + 6,\n y2 – 7y + 12,  z2 – 4z – 12, 3 m2 + 9m + 6, etc. Observe that these expressions are not\nof  the type (a + b ) 2 or (a – b ) 2, i.e., they are not perfect squares. For example, in\nx2 + 5x + 6, the term 6 is not a perfect square.  These expressions obviously also do not\nfit the type ( a2 – b2) either .\nThey , however , seem to be of the type x2 + (a + b ) x + a b. We may therefore, try to\nuse Identity IV studied in the last chapter to factorise these expressions:\n(x + a ) (x + b ) =x2 + (a + b ) x + ab (IV)\nFor that we have to look at the coefficients of x and the constant term. Let us see how\nit is done in the following example.\nExample 9:  Factorise x2 + 5x + 6\nSolution:   If we compare the R.H.S. of Identity (IV) with x2 + 5x + 6, we find ab = 6,\nand a + b = 5. From this, we must obtain a and b. The factors then will be\n(x + a) and ( x + b).\nIf  a b  = 6, it means that a and b are factors of 6.  Let us try  a = 6, b  = 1. For these\nvalues  a + b = 7, and not 5, So this choice is not right.\nLet us try  a = 2, b = 3.  For this a + b = 5 exactly as required.\nThe factorised form of this given expression is then  ( x +2) ( x + 3).\nIn general, for factorising an algebraic expression of the type x2 + px + q, we find two\nfactors a and b of q (i.e., the constant term) such that\nab = q    and     a + b = p\nThen, the expression becomes x2 + (a + b) x + ab\nor x2 + ax + bx + ab\nor x(x + a) + b(x + a)\nor (x + a) (x + b)        which are the required factors.\nExample 10:  Find the factors of y2 –7y +12.\nSolution:   We note 12 = 3 × 4 and 3 + 4 = 7.  Therefore,\n      y2 – 7y+ 12 = y2 – 3y – 4y + 12\n                          = y (y –3) – 4 (y  –3)  = (y –3) ( y – 4)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFACTORISATION   151\nNote, this time we did not compare the expression with that in Identity (IV) to identify\na and b .  After suf ficient practice you may not need to compare the given expressions for\ntheir factorisation with the expressions in the identities; instead you can proceed directly\nas we did above.\nExample 11:  Obtain the factors of z2 – 4z – 12.\nSolution:  Here a b = –12 ; this means one of a  and b is negative. Further , a + b  = – 4,\nthis means the one with lar ger numerical value is negative. We try a = – 4, \nb = 3; but\nthis will not work, since a + b = –1.  Next possible values are a = – 6, b = 2, so that\na + b = – 4 as required.\nHence, z2  – 4z –12 = z2  – 6z + 2 z –12\n=z(z – 6) + 2(z – 6 )\n= (z – 6) ( z + 2)\nExample 12:  Find the factors of 3 m2 + 9m +  6.\nSolution:  We notice that 3 is a common factor of all the terms.\nTherefore, 3m2 + 9m + 6 = 3(m2 + 3m + 2)\nNow , m 2 + 3m + 2 = m2 + m + 2m + 2 (as 2 = 1 × 2)\n=m(m + 1)+ 2( \nm + 1)\n                  = (m + 1) ( m + 2)\nTherefore, 3m2 + 9m + 6 = 3(m + 1) ( m + 2)\nEXERCISE 12.2\n1.Factorise the following expressions.\n(i)a2 + 8a + 16 (ii)p2 – 10 p + 25 (iii) 25m2 + 30m  + 9\n(iv) 49y2 + 84 yz + 36 z2(v)4x2 – 8x + 4\n(vi) 121b2 – 88 bc + 16 c2\n(vii) (l + m)2 – 4lm        (Hint: Expand ( l + m)2 first)\n(viii) a4 + 2a2b2 + b4\n2.Factorise.\n(i)4p2 – 9q2(ii)63a2 – 112b2(iii) 49x2 – 36\n(iv) 16x5 – 144 x3(v)(l + m)2 – (l – m)2\n(vi) 9x2 y2 – 16 (vii) (x2 – 2xy + y2) – z2\n(viii) 25a2 – 4b2 + 28bc  – 49 c2\n3.Factorise the expressions.\n(i)ax2 + bx (ii)7p2 + 21 q2(iii) 2x3 + 2xy2  + 2 xz2\n(iv) am2 + bm2 + bn2 + an2(v)(lm + l) +  m + 1\n(vi) y (y + z) + 9 (y + z) (vii) 5y2 – 20 y – 8z + 2yz\n(viii) 10ab + 4 a  + 5b  + 2 (ix) 6xy – 4y + 6 – 9 x\nReprint 2024-25\n\n152  MATHEMA TICS\n4.Factorise.\n(i)a4 – b4(ii)p4 – 81 (iii) x4 – (y + z)4\n(iv) x4 – (x – z)4(v)a4 – 2a2b2 + b4\n5.Factorise the following expressions.\n(i)p2 + 6p\n + 8 (ii)q2 – 10 q + 21 (iii) p2 + 6p – 16\n12.3  Division of Algebraic Expressions\nWe have learnt how to add and subtract algebraic expressions. We also know how to\nmultiply two expressions. We have not however , looked at division of one algebraic\nexpression by another . This is what we wish to do in this section.\nWe recall that division is the inverse operation of multiplication. Thus, 7 × 8 = 56 gives\n56 ÷ 8 = 7 or 56 ÷  7 = 8.\nWe may similarly follow the division of algebraic expressions. For example,\n(i) 2x × 3x2 =6x3\nTherefore, 6x3 ÷ 2x =3x2\nand also, 6x3 ÷ 3x2 =2x.\n(ii) 5x (x + 4) = 5x2 + 20 x\nTherefore, (5x2 + 20 x) ÷ 5x =x + 4\nand also (5x2 + 20 x) ÷ (x + 4) = 5x.\nWe shall now look closely at how the division of one expression by another can be\ncarried out. To begin with we shall consider the division of a monomial by another monomial.\n12.3.1  Division of a monomial by another monomial\nConsider  6 x3 ÷ 2x\nWe may write 2 x and 6 x3 in irreducible factor forms,\n2x =2 × x\n6x3 =2 × 3 × x × x × x\nNow we group factors of 6 x3 to separate 2x ,\n6x3 =2 × x × (3 × x  × x) = (2x ) × (3x2)\nTherefore, 6x3 ÷ 2x =3x2.\nA shorter way to depict cancellation of common factors is as we do in division of numbers:\n77 ÷ 7 = 77\n7=7 11\n7× = 11\nSimilarly , 6x3 ÷ 2x =36\n2x\nx\n=2 3\n2x x x\nx× × × ×\n× = 3 × x × x = 3x2\nExample 13:  Do the following divisions.\n(i)–20x4 ÷ 10x2(ii)7x2y2z2 ÷ 14\nxyz\nSolution:\n(i)–20x4 = –2 × 2 × 5 × x  × x × x × x\n  10x2 = 2 × 5 × x  × x\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFACTORISATION   153\nTRY THESETherefore, (–20x4) ÷ 10x2 =2 2 5\n2 5x x x x\nx x− × × × × × ×\n× × × = –2 × x × x = –2 x2\n(ii)7x2y2z2 ÷ 14xyz =7\n2 7x x y y z z\nx y z× × × × × ×\n× × × ×\n =2x y z× × = 1\n2xyz\nDivide.\n(i)24xy2z3 by 6 yz2(ii)63a2b4c6 by 7 a2b2c3\n12.3.2  Division of a polynomial by a monomial\nLet us consider the division of the trinomial 4 y3 + 5y2 + 6y by the monomial 2 y.\n4\ny3 + 5y2 + 6y = (2 × 2 × y × y × y ) + (5 × y × y) + (2 × 3 × y)\n(Here, we expressed each term of the polynomial in factor form) we find that 2 × y is\ncommon in each term.

These factors may be\nnumbers, algebraic variables or algebraic expressions.\n2.An irreducible factor is a factor which cannot be expressed further as a product of factors.\n3.A systematic way of factorising an expression is the common factor method. It consists of\nthree steps: (i) Write each term of the expression as a product of irreducible factors (ii) Look\nfor and separate the common factors and (iii) Combine the remaining factors in each term in\naccordance with the distributive law .\n4.Sometimes, all the terms in a given expression do not have a common factor; but the terms can\nbe grouped in such a way that all the terms in each group have a common factor . When we do\nthis, there emerges a common factor across all the groups leading to the required factorisation\nof the expression. This is the method of regrouping.\n5.In factorisation by regrouping, we should remember that any regrouping (i.e., rearrangement)\nof the terms in the given expression may not lead to factorisation. We must observe the\nexpression and come out with the desired regrouping by trial and error .\nReprint 2024-25\n\n156  MATHEMA TICS\n6.A number of expressions to be factorised are of the form or can be put into the form : a2 + 2 ab + b2,\na2 – 2ab + b2, a2 – b2 and x2 + (a + b\n) + ab. These expressions can be easily factorised using\nIdentities I, II, III and IV .\na2 + 2 ab + b2 =(a + b)2\na2 – 2ab + b2 =(a – b)2\na2 – b2 =(a + b) (a – b)\nx2 + (a + b) x + ab = (x + a) (x + b)\n7.In expressions which have factors of the type ( x + a) (x + b), remember the numerical term gives ab. Its\nfactors, a and b, should be so chosen that their sum, with signs taken care of, is the coefficient of x.\n8.We know that in the case of numbers, division is the inverse of multiplication. This idea is applicable\nalso to the division of algebraic expressions.\n9.In the case of division of a polynomial by a monomial, we may carry out the division either by\ndividing each term of the polynomial by the monomial or by the common factor method.\n10. In the case of division of a polynomial by a polynomial, we cannot proceed by dividing each term\nin the dividend polynomial by the divisor polynomial. Instead, we factorise both the polynomials\nand cancel their common factors.\n11.In the case of divisions of algebraic expressions that we studied in this chapter , we have\nDividend = Divisor × Quotient.\nIn general, however , the relation is\nDividend = Divisor × Quotient + Remainder\nThus, we have considered in the present chapter only those divisions in which the remainder\nis zero.\nReprint 2024-25\n"}

The purpose\nof the graph is to show numerical facts in visual form so that they can be understood\nquickly , easily and clearly . Thus graphs are visual representations of data collected.\nData can also be presented in the form of a table; however a graphical presentation is\neasier to understand. This is true in particular when there is a trend  or comparison  to\nbe shown.\nWe have already seen some types of graphs. Let us quickly recall them here.\n13.1.1  A line graph\nA line graph displays data that changes continuously over periods of time.\nWhen Renu fell sick, her doctor maintained a record of her body temperature, taken\nevery four hours. It was in the form of a graph (shown in Fig 13.1 and Fig 13.2).\nWe may call this a “time-temperature graph”.\nIt is a pictorial representation of the following data, given in tabular form.\nTime 6 a.m. 10 a.m. 2 p.m. 6 p.m.\nTemperatur e(°C) 37 40 38\n35\nThe horizontal line (usually called the x-axis) shows the timings at which the\ntemperatures were recorded.

The result is the  line graph .\nWhat all does this graph tell you? For example you can see the pattern of temperature;\nmore at 10 a.m. (see Fig 13.3) and then decreasing till 6 p.m. Notice that the temperature\nincreased by 3° C(= 40° C – 37° C) during the period 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.\nThere was no recording of temperature at 8 a.m., however the graph suggests that it\nwas more than 37 °C (How?).\nExample 1:  (A graph on “performance”)\nThe given graph (Fig 13.3) represents the total runs scored by two batsmen A and B,\nduring each of the ten different matches in the year 2007. Study the graph and answer the\nfollowing questions.\n(i)What information is given on the two axes?\n(ii)Which line shows the runs scored by batsman A?\n(iii) Were the run scored by them same in any match in 2007? If so, in which match?\n(iii)Among the two batsmen, who is steadier? How do you judge it?\nSolution:\n(i)The horizontal axis (or the x-axis) indicates the matches played during the year\n2007. The vertical axis (or the y-axis) shows the total runs scored in each match.\n(ii)The dotted line shows the runs scored by Batsman A.

(This is indicated by the point\nat which both graphs meet).\n(iv) Batsman A has one great “peak” but many deep\n“valleys”. He does not appear to be  consistent.\nB, on the other hand has never scored below a\ntotal of 40 runs, even though his highest score is\nonly 100 in comparison to 1 15 of A. Also A has\nscored a zero in two matches and in a total of 5\nmatches he has scored less than 40 runs. Since A\nhas a lot of ups and downs, B is a more consistent\nand reliable b atsman.\nExample 2:   The given graph (Fig 13.4) describes\nthe distances of a car from a city P at different times\nwhen it is travelling from City P to City Q, which are\n350 km apart.

[This can be seen as follows.\nAt 8 a.m. it just started from City P . At 9 a.m. it was at the 50th km (seen from graph).\nHence during the one-hour time between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. the car travelled 50 km].\n(iv) The distance covered by the car during\n(a)the 2nd hour (i.e., from 9 am to 10 am) is 100 km, (150 – 50).\n(b) the 3rd hour (i.e., from 10 am to 1 1 am) is 50 km (200 – 150).\n(v)From the answers to questions (iii) and (iv), we find that the speed of the car was not\nthe same all the time. (In fact the graph illustrates how the speed varied).\n(vi) We find that the car was 200 km away from city P when the time was 1 1 a.m. and\nalso at 12 noon. This shows that the car did not travel during the interval 1 1 a.m. to\n12 noon.

If more electricity is consumed, the bill is bound to be high. If less electricity is\nused, then the bill will be easily manageable. This is an instance where one quantity affects\nanother . Amount of electric bill depends on the quantity of electricity used. We say that the\nquantity of electricity is an independent variable (or sometimes control variable ) and\nthe amount of electric bill is the dependent variable . The relation between such variables\ncan be shown through a graph.\nTHINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE\nThe number of litres of petrol you buy to fill a car ’s petrol tank will decide the amount\nyou have to pay . Which is the independent variable here? Think about it.\nExample 3:  (Quantity and Cost)\nThe following table gives  the quantity of petrol and its cost.\nNo. of Litres of petrol 10\n15 20 25\nCost of petrol in ` 500\n750 1000 1250\nPlot a graph to show the data.\nSolution:  (i) Let us take a suitable scale on both the axes (Fig 13.5).Cost (in ` `` ``)\nFig 13.5\nReprint 2024-25\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO GRAPHS  165\nTRY THESE(ii)Mark number of litres along the horizontal axis.\n(iii) Mark cost of petrol along the vertical axis.\n(iv) Plot the points: (10,500), (15,750), (20,1000), (25,1250).\n(v)Join the points.\nWe find that the graph is a line. (It is a linear graph). Why does this graph pass through\nthe origin? Think about it.\nThis graph can help us to estimate a few things. Suppose we want to find the amount\nneeded to buy 12 litres of petrol. Locate 12 on the horizontal axis.\nFollow the vertical line through 12 till you meet the graph at P (say).\nFrom P you take a horizontal line to meet the vertical axis. This meeting point provides\nthe answer .\nThis is the graph of a situation in which two quantities, are in direct variation.

For example,\nthe equation x + 2 = 13 (1)\nis solved when x = 11, because this value of x satisfies the given equation. The  solution\n11 is a natural number . On the other hand, for the equation\nx + 5 = 5 (2)\nthe solution gives the whole number 0 (zero). If we consider only natural numbers,\nequation (2) cannot be solved. To solve equations like (2), we added the number zero to\nthe collection of natural numbers and obtained the whole numbers. Even whole numbers\nwill not be sufficient to solve equations of type\nx + 18 = 5 (3)\nDo you see ‘why’? We require the number –13 which is not a whole number . This\nled us to think of integers, (positive and negative) . Note that the positive integers\ncorrespond to natural numbers. One may think that we have enough numbers to solve all\nsimple equations with the available list of integers. Now consider the equations\n2x  =3 (4)\n5\nx + 7 = 0 (5)\nfor which we cannot find a solution from the integers . (Check this)\nWe need the numbers 3\n2 to solve equation (4) and 7\n5−\n to solve\nequation (5). This leads us to the collection of rational numbers .\nWe have already seen basic operations on rational\nnumbers. We now try to explore some properties of operations\non the dif ferent types of numbers seen so far .Rational NumbersCHAPTER1\nReprint 2024-25\n\n2  MATHEMA TICS\n1.2  Properties of Rational Numbers\n1.2.1  Closure\n(i)Whole numbers\nLet us revisit the closure property for all the operations on whole numbers in brief.\nOperation Numbers Remarks\nAddition 0 + 5 = 5, a whole number Whole numbers are closed\n4 + 7 = ... .

However , integers are closed under addition, subtraction\nand multiplication but not under division.\n(iii) Rational numbers\nRecall that a number which can be written in the form p\nq, where p and q are integers\nand q ≠ 0 is called a rational number . For example, 2\n3−, 6\n7, 9\n5− are all rational\nnumbers. Since the numbers 0, –2, 4 can be written in the form p\nq, they are also\nrational numbers.

For example, 2 xy + 5\nhas two variables. We however, restrict to expressions with only one variable when we\nform equations. Moreover, the expressions we use to form equations are linear . This means\nthat the highest power of the variable appearing in the expression is 1.\nThese are linear expressions:\n2x, 2x + 1, 3 y – 7, 12 – 5z , 5( – 4) 104x +\nThese are not linear expressions:\nx2 + 1, y + y2, 1 + z + z2 + z3(since highest power of  variable > 1)\nHere we will deal with equations with linear expressions in one variable only. Such\nequations are known as linear equations in one variable . The simple equations which\nyou studied in the earlier classes were all of this type.Let us briefly revise what we know:\n(a) An algebraic equation is an equality\ninvolving variables . It  has an equality sign .\nThe expression on the left of the equality sign\nis the Left Hand Side  (LHS). The expression\non the right of the equality sign is the Right\nHand Side  (RHS).\n\n\n\n2x – 3 =7\n2x – 3 = LHS\n7 =RHS\nReprint 2024-25\n\n\n(b)In an equation the values of\nthe expr essions on the LHS\nand RHS are equal . This\nhappens to be true only for\ncertain values of the variable.\nThese values are thesolutions  of the equation.\n(c) How to find the solution of an equation?\nWe assume that the two sides of the equation are balanced.\nWe perform the same mathematical operations on both\nsides of the equation, so that the balance is not disturbed.\nA few such steps give the solution.\n2.2 Solving Equations having the V ariable on\nboth Sides\nAn equation is the equality of the values of two expressions. In the equation 2 x – 3 = 7,\nthe two expressions are  2 x – 3 and 7.  In most examples that we have come across so\nfar, the RHS is just a number.  But this need not always be so; both sides could have\nexpressions with variables.  For example, the equation  2x – 3 = x + 2 has expressions\nwith a variable on both sides; the expression on the LHS is (2 x – 3) and the expression\non the RHS is ( x + 2).\n•We now discuss how to solve such equations which have expressions with the variable\non both sides.\nExample 1:  Solve 2 x – 3 = x + 2\nSolution:  We have\n2x =x + 2 + 3\nor 2x =x + 5\nor 2x – x =x + 5 – x(subtracting x from both sides)\nor x = 5 (solution)\nHere we subtracted from both sides of the equation, not a number (constant), but a\nterm involving the variable. We can do this as variables are also numbers. Also, note that\nsubtracting x from both sides amounts to transposing x to LHS.\nExample 2:  Solve 5x  + 731422x=−\nSolution:  Multiply both sides of the equation by 2.

AD and BC form another pair of opposite sides.\n∠A and ∠C are a pair of opposite angles ; another pair of opposite angles would be\n∠B and ∠D.\nAB and BC are adjacent sides .

They are at the ends of the same side. ∠B and ∠C\nare also adjacent. Identify other pairs of adjacent angles of the parallelogram.\nTake cut-outs of two identical parallelograms, say ABCD and A′B′C′D′ (Fig 3.13).\nHere AB is same as A B′ ′ except for the name. Similarly the other corresponding\nsides are equal too.\nPlace A B′ ′ over DC. Do they coincide? What can you now say about the lengths\nAB and DC?\nSimilarly examine the lengths AD and BC. What do you find?\nYou may also arrive at this result by measuring AB and DC.\nProper ty: The opposite sides of a parallelogram ar e of equal length.\nTake two identical set squares with angles 30° – 60° – 90°\nand place them adjacently to form a parallelogram as shown\nin Fig 3.14.

What can we\nsay about the angles?\nLet ABCD be a parallelogram (Fig 3.17). Copy it on\na tracing sheet. Name this copy as A′B′C′D′. Place\nA′B′C′D′ on ABCD. Pin them together at the point\nwhere the diagonals meet. Rotate the transparent sheet\nby 180°. The parallelograms still concide; but you now\nfind A′ lying exactly on C and vice-versa; similarly B ′\nlies on D and vice-versa.\nDoes this tell you anything about the measures of the angles A and C? Examine the\nsame for angles B and D. State your findings.\nProper ty: The opposite angles of a parallelogram ar e of equal measur e.\nTake two identical 30° – 60° – 90° set-squares and form a parallelogram as before.\nDoes the figure obtained help you to confirm the above property?\nYou can further justify this idea through logical ar guments.\nIf  AC and BD are the diagonals of the\nparallelogram, (Fig 3.18) you find that\n∠1 =∠ 2and ∠3 = ∠4      (Why?)\nFig 3.17\nFig 3.18\nReprint 2024-25\n\nUNDERSTANDING  QUADRILATERALS   29\nFig 3.20Studying ∆ ABC and ∆ ADC (Fig 3.19) separately , will help you to see that by ASA\ncongruency condition,\n∆ ABC ≅ ∆ CDA (How?)\nFig 3.19\nThis shows that ∠B and ∠ D have same measure. In the same way you can get\nm∠A = m ∠C.\nAlternatively , ∠1 = ∠2 and ∠3 = ∠4, we have, m∠A = ∠1+∠4 = ∠2+∠C  m∠C\nExample 4: In Fig 3.20, BEST is a parallelogram. Find the values x, y and z.\nSolution:  S is opposite to B.\nSo, x =100° (opposite angles property)\ny =100° (measure of angle corresponding to ∠x)\nz =80° (since ∠y, ∠z is a linear pair)\nWe now turn our attention to adjacent angles of a parallelogram.\nIn parallelogram ABCD, (Fig 3.21).\n∠A and ∠D are supplementary since\nDC AB/parallelto  and with transversal DA, these\ntwo angles are interior opposite.\n∠A and ∠B are also supplementary . Can you\nsay ‘why’?\nAD BC/parallelto  and BA is a transversal, making ∠A and ∠B interior opposite.\nIdentify two more pairs of supplementary angles from the figure.\nProper ty: The adjacent angles in a parallelogram ar e supplementar y.\nExample 5: In a parallelogram RING , (Fig 3.22) if m∠R = 70°, find all the other angles.\nSolution:  Given m∠R =70°\nThen m∠N = 70°\nbecause ∠R and ∠N are opposite angles of a parallelogram.\nSince ∠R and ∠I are supplementary ,\nm∠I =180° – 70° = 1 10°\nAlso, m∠G =110° since ∠G is opposite to ∠I\nThus, m∠R =m∠N = 70° and m∠I = m∠G = 1 10°Fig 3.21\nFig 3.22\nReprint 2024-25\n\n30  MATHEMA TICS\nDO THISAfter showing m ∠R = m∠N = 70°, can you find m∠I and m∠G by any other\nmethod?\n3.3.6 Diagonals of a parallelogram\nThe diagonals of a parallelogram, in general, are not of equal length.\n(Did you check this in your earlier activity?) However , the diagonals\nof a parallelogram have an interesting property .\nTake a cut-out of a parallelogram, say ,\nABCD (Fig 3.23). Let its diagonals AC and DB meet at O.\nFind the mid point of AC by a fold, placing C on A. Is the\nmid-point same as O?\n Does this show that diagonal DB bisects the diagonal AC at the point O? Discuss it\nwith your friends. Repeat the activity to find where the mid point of   DB could lie.\nProperty: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other (at the point of their\nintersection, of course!)\nTo argue and justify this property is not very\ndifficult. From Fig 3.24, applying ASA  criterion, it\nis easy to see that\n∆ AOB ≅ ∆ COD    (How is ASA  used here?)\nThis gives AO = CO and BO = DO\nExample 6: In Fig 3.25 HELP is a parallelogram. (Lengths are in cms). Given that\nOE = 4 and HL is 5 more than PE? Find OH.\nSolution :  IfOE = 4 then OP also is 4 (Why?)\nSo PE = 8, (Why?)\nTherefore HL = 8 + 5 = 13\nHence OH =1132× = 6.5 (cms)\nEXERCISE 3.3\n1.Given a parallelogram ABCD.

Here lengths AB and\nBC were dif ferent. If you draw AB = BC, then the kite you obtain is called a rhombus .Fig 3.27\nFig 3.28Fig 3.26\nNote that the sides of rhombus are all of same length;\nthis is not the case with the kite.\nA rhombus is a quadrilateral with sides of equal length.\nSince the opposite sides of a rhombus have the same\nlength, it is also a parallelogram. So, a rhombus has all\nthe pr operties of a parallelogram and also that of a\nkite. Try to list them out. You can then verify your list\nwith the check list summarised in the book elsewhere.\nKiteRhombus\nReprint 2024-25\n\nUNDERSTANDING  QUADRILATERALS   33\nDO THISThe most useful property of a rhombus is that of its diagonals.\nProper ty: The diagonals of a r hombus ar e perpendicular bisectors of one another .\nTake a copy of rhombus. By paper -folding verify if the point of intersection is the\nmid-point of each diagonal. You may also check if they intersect at right angles, using\nthe corner of a set-square.\nHere is an outline justifying this property using logical steps.\nABCD is a rhombus (Fig 3.29). Therefore it is a parallelogram too.\nSince diagonals bisect each other ,      OA  = OC  and  OB = OD.\nWe have to show that m∠AOD = m∠COD = 90°\nIt can be seen that by SSS congruency criterion\n∆ AOD ≅ ∆ COD\nTherefore, m ∠AOD = m ∠COD\nSince ∠\nAOD and ∠COD are a linear pair ,\nm ∠AOD = m ∠COD = 90°\nExample 7:\nRICE is a rhombus (Fig 3.30). Find x, y, z. Justify your findings.\nSolution:\nx =OE y =OR z =side of the rhombus\n=OI  (diagonals bisect) =OC (diagonals bisect) =13 (all sides are equal )\n= 5 = 12\n3.4.2  A rectangle\nA rectangle is a parallelogram with equal angles (Fig 3.31).\nWhat is the full meaning of this definition? Discuss with your friends.\nIf the rectangle is to be equiangular , what could be\nthe measure of each angle?\nLet the measure of each angle be x°.\nThen 4x° =360° (Why)?\nTherefore, x° =90°\nThus each angle of a rectangle is a right angle.\nSo, a rectangle is a parallelogram in which every angle is a right angle.\nBeing a parallelogram, the rectangle has opposite sides of equal length and its diagonals\nbisect each other .Fig 3.29\nSince AO =CO (Why?)\nAD = CD (Why?)\nOD = OD\nFig 3.30\nFig 3.31\nReprint 2024-25\n\n34  MATHEMA TICS\nIn a parallelogram, the diagonals can be of different lengths. (Check this); but surprisingly\nthe rectangle (being a special case) has diagonals of equal length.\nProper ty: The diagonals of a r ectangle ar e of equal length.\nThis is easy to justify . If ABCD is a rectangle (Fig 3.38),  then looking at triangles\nABC and ABD separately [(Fig 3.33) and (Fig 3.34) respectively], we have\n∆ ABC ≅∆ ABD\nThis is because AB = AB (Common)\nBC = AD (Why?)\nm ∠A =m ∠B = 90° (Why?)\nThe congruency follows by SAS criterion.\nThus AC = BD\nand in a r ectangle the diagonals, besides being equal in length bisect each other  (Why?)\nExample 8: RENT is a rectangle (Fig 3.35). Its diagonals meet at O. Find x, if\nOR = 2 x + 4 and OT = 3x  + 1.\nSolution:  OT is half of the diagonal TE,\nOR is half of the diagonal RN.\nDiagonals are equal here. (Why?)\nSo, their halves are also equal.\nTherefore 3x + 1 = 2x + 4\nor x =3\n3.4.3  A square\nA square is a rectangle with equal sides.\nThis means a square has all the\nproperties of a rectangle with an additional\nrequirement that all the sides have equal\nlength.\nThe square, like the rectangle, has\ndiagonals of equal length.\nIn a rectangle, there is no requirement\nfor the diagonals to be perpendicular to\none another , (Check this).Fig 3.34 Fig 3.33 Fig 3.32\nFig 3.35\nBELT is a square, BE = EL  = LT = TB\n∠B, ∠E, ∠L, ∠T are right angles.\nBL = ET and BL ET⊥ .\n OB = OL  and OE = OT .\nReprint 2024-25\n\nUNDERSTANDING  QUADRILATERALS   35\nDO THISIn a square the diagonals.\n(i)bisect one another (square being a parallelogram)\n(ii)are of equal length (square being a rectangle) and\n(iii) are perpendicular to one another .\nHence, we get the following property .\nProper ty: The diagonals of a squar e are perpendicular bisectors of each other .\nTake a square sheet, say PQRS (Fig 3.37).\nFold along both the diagonals. Are their mid-points the same?\nCheck if the angle at O is 90° by using a set-square.\nThis verifies the property stated above.\nWe can justify this also by ar guing logically:\nABCD is a square whose diagonals meet at O (Fig 3.37).\nOA = OC   (Since the square is a parallelogram)\nBy SSS congruency condition, we now see that\n∆ AOD ≅ ∆ COD    (How?)\nTherefore, m∠AOD = m∠COD\nThese angles being a linear pair , each is right angle.\nEXERCISE 3.4\n1.State whether True or False.\n(a)All rectangles are squares (e)All kites are rhombuses.\n(b) All rhombuses are parallelograms (f)All rhombuses are kites.\n(c)All squares are rhombuses and also rectangles (g)All parallelograms are trapeziums.\n(d) All squares are not parallelograms.

However, by chance, one day you for get to\ntake the raincoat and it rains heavily on that day .\nSometimes it so happens that a student prepares 4 chapters out of 5, very wellfor a test. But a major question is asked from the chapter that she left unprepared.\nEveryone knows that a particular train runs in time but the day you reach\nwell in time it is late!\nYou face a lot of situations such as these where you take a chance and it\ndoes not go the way you want it to. Can you give some more examples? Theseare examples where the chances of a certain thing happening or not happeningare not equal. The chances of the train being in time or being late are not thesame. When you buy a ticket which is wait listed, you do take a chance. You\nhope that it might get confirmed by the time you travel.\nWe however , consider here certain experiments whose results have an equal chance\nof occurring.\n4.3.1  Getting a result\nYou might have seen that before a cricket match starts, captains of the two teams go out\nto toss a coin to decide which team will bat first.\nWhat are the possible results you get when a coin is tossed? Of course, Head or Tail.\nImagine that you are the captain of one team and your friend is the captain of the other\nteam. You toss a coin and ask your friend to make the call. Can you control the result of\nthe toss? Can you get a head if you want one? Or a tail if you want that? No, that is notpossible. Such an experiment is called a random experiment . Head or Tail are the two\noutcomes of this experiment.\n1.If you try to start a scooter , what are the possible outcomes?\n2.When a die is thrown, what are the six possible outcomes?\nOh!\n my\nraincoat.\nReprint 2024-25\n\n\nTHINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE3.When you spin the wheel shown, what are the possible outcomes?

This means that each of the outcomes has the same chance of occurring.\n4.3.3  Linking chances to probability\nConsider the experiment of tossing a coin once. What are the outcomes? There are only\ntwo outcomes – Head or Tail. Both the outcomes are equally likely . Likelihood of getting\na head is one out of two outcomes, i.e., 1\n2. In other words, we say that the probability of\ngetting a head = 1\n2.

So, 2 m,\nm2 – 1 and m2 + 1 forms a Pythagorean triplet.\nTry to find some more Pythagorean triplets using this form.\nExample 2:  Write a Pythagorean triplet whose smallest member is 8.\nSolution:  We can get Pythagorean triplets by using general form 2 m, m2 – 1, m2 + 1.\nLet us first take m2 – 1 = 8\nSo, m2 =8 + 1 = 9\nwhich gives m =3\nTherefore, 2m =6   and    m2 + 1 = 10\nThe triplet is thus 6, 8, 10.  But 8 is not the smallest member of this.\nSo, let us try 2m =8\nthen m =4\nWe get m2 – 1 = 16 – 1 = 15\nand m2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17\nThe triplet is 8, 15, 17 with 8 as the smallest member .\nExample 3:  Find a Pythagorean triplet in which one member is 12.\nSolution:  If we take m2 – 1 = 12\nThen, m2 =12 + 1 = 13\nThen the value of m will not be an integer .\nSo, we try to take m2 + 1 = 12. Again m2 = 11 will not give an integer value for m.\nSo, let us take 2m =12\nthen m =6\nThus, m2 – 1 = 36 – 1 = 35    and m2 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37\nTherefore, the required triplet is 12, 35, 37.Note:  All Pythagorean triplets may not be obtained using this form.

Then,\n(i)81 – 1 = 80 (ii)80 – 3 = 77 (iii) 77 – 5 = 72 (iv) 72 – 7 = 65\n(v)65 – 9 = 56 (vi) 56 – 1 1 = 45 (vii) 45 – 13 = 32 (viii) 32 – 15 = 17\n(ix) 17 – 17 = 0\nFrom 81 we have subtracted successive odd\nnumbers starting from 1 and obtained 0 at 9th step.\nTherefore 81 = 9.\nCan you find the square root of  729 using this method?\nYes, but it will be time consuming. Let us try to find it in\na simpler way .\n5.5.3  Finding square root through prime factorisation\nConsider the prime factorisation of the following numbers and their squares.\nPrime factorisation of a Number Prime factorisation of its Square\n6 =2 × 3 36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3\n8 = 2 × 2 × 2 64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2\n12 = 2 × 2 × 3 144 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3\n15 = 3 × 5 225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5\nHow many times does 2 occur in the prime factorisation of 6? Once. How many times\ndoes 2 occur in the prime factorisation of 36? Twice. Similarly , observe the occurrence of\n3 in 6 and 36 of 2 in 8 and 64 etc.\nYou will find that each prime factor in the prime factorisation of the\nsquare of a number, occurs twice the number of times it occurs in the\nprime factorisation of the number itself. Let us use this to find the squareroot of a given square number, say 324.We know that the prime factorisation of 324 is\n324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3TRY THESE\nBy repeated subtraction of odd numbers startingfrom 1, find whether the following numbers areperfect squares or not?

Prime factorisation of  256 is\n256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2\nBy pairing the prime factors we get,\n256 = 2 × 2  × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2  = (2 × 2 × 2 × 2)2\nTherefore, 256  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16\nIs 48 a perfect square?\nWe know 48 = 2 × 2  × 2 × 2 × 3\nSince all the factors are not in pairs so 48 is not a perfect square.\nSuppose we want to find the smallest multiple of 48 that is a perfect square, how\nshould we proceed? Making pairs of the prime factors of 48 we see that 3 is the only\nfactor that does not have a pair . So we need to multiply by 3 to complete the pair .\nHence 48 × 3 = 144 is a perfect square.\nCan you tell by which number should we divide 48 to get a perfect square?\nThe factor 3 is not in pair, so if we divide 48 by 3 we get 48 ÷ 3 = 16 = 2 × 2  × 2 × 2\nand this number 16 is a perfect square too.\nExample 4:Find the square root of 6400.\nSolution : Write 6400 = 2 × 2  × 2 × 2  × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5\nTherefore 6400  =2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 = 80\nExample 5: Is 90 a perfect square?\nSolution : We have 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5\nThe prime factors 2 and 5 do not occur in pairs. Therefore, 90 is not a perfect square.\nThat 90 is not a perfect square can also be seen from the fact that  it has only one zero.\nExample 6: Is 2352 a perfect square? If not, find the smallest multiple of 2352 which\nis a perfect square. Find the square root of the new number .\nSolution : We have 2352 = 2 × 2  × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 7\nAs the prime factor 3 has no pair, 2352 is not a perfect square.\nIf 3 gets a pair then the number will become perfect square. So, we multiply 2352 by 3 to get,\n2352 × 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 7\nNow each prime factor is in a pair . Therefore, 2352 × 3 = 7056   is a perfect square.\nThus the required smallest multiple of 2352 is 7056 which is a perfect square.\nAnd, 7056  =2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 84\nExample 7:  Find the smallest number by which 9408 must be divided so that the\nquotient is a perfect square.

(Why?)\nTherefore, the required smallest number is 3.\nAnd, 3136  =2 × 2 × 2 × 7 = 56.\nExample 8:  Find the smallest square number which is divisible by each of the numbers\n6, 9 and 15.\nSolution : This has to be done in two steps. First find the smallest common multiple and\nthen find the square number needed. The least number divisible by each one of 6, 9 and\n15 is their LCM. The LCM of 6, 9 and 15 is 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 90.Prime factorisation of 90 is 90 = 2 × \n3 × 3  × 5.\nWe see that prime factors 2 and 5 are not in pairs. Therefore 90 is not a perfect\nsquare.\nIn order to get a perfect square, each factor of 90 must be paired. So we need to\nmake pairs of 2 and 5. Therefore, 90 should be multiplied by 2 × 5, i.e., 10.Hence, the required square number is 90 × 10 = 900.\nEXERCISE 5.3\n1.What could be the possible ‘one’ s’ digits of the square root of each of the following\nnumbers?\n(i)9801 (ii)99856 (iii) 998001 (iv) 657666025\n2.Without doing any calculation, find the numbers which are surely not perfect squares.\n(i)153 (ii)257 (iii) 408 (iv)  441\n3.Find the square roots of 100 and 169 by the method of repeated subtraction.\n4.Find the square roots of the following numbers by the Prime Factorisation Method.\n(i)729 (ii)400 (iii) 1764 (iv) 4096\n(v)7744 (vi) 9604 (vii) 5929 (viii) 9216\n(ix) 529 (x)8100\n5.For each of the following numbers, find the smallest whole number by which it shouldbe multiplied so as to get a perfect square number .

To overcome this problem we use Long Division Method.\nFor this we need to determine the number of digits in the square root.See the following table:\nNumber Square\n10 100 which is the smallest 3-digit perfect square\n31 961 which is the greatest 3-digit perfect square\n32 1024 which is the smallest 4-digit perfect square\n99 9801 which is the greatest 4-digit perfect square\nSo, what can we say about the number of digits in the square root if a perfect\nsquare is a 3-digit or a 4-digit number? W e can say that, if a perfect square is a\n3-digit or a 4-digit number, then its square root will have 2-digits.\nCan you tell the number of digits in the square root of a 5-digit or a 6-digit\nperfect square?\nThe smallest 3-digit perfect square number is 100 which is the square of 10 and the\ngreatest 3-digit perfect square number is 961 which is the square of 31. The smallest\n4-digit square number is 1024 which is the square of 32 and the greatest 4-digit number is9801 which is the square of 99.\nCan we say that if a perfect square is of n-digits, then its square root will have \n2n\ndigits if n is even or ( 1)\n2n+ if n is odd?\nThe use of the number of digits in square root of a number is useful in the following method:\n•Consider the following steps to find the square root of 529.\nCan you estimate the number of digits in the square root of this number?\nStep 1 Place a bar over every pair of digits starting from the digit at one’s place. If the\nnumber of digits in it is odd, then the left-most single digit too will have a bar .\nThus we have, 529.\nStep 2 Find the largest number whose square is less than or equal to the number under the\nextreme left bar (22 < 5 < 32). Take this number as the divisor and the quotient\nwith the number under the extreme left  bar as the dividend  (here 5) .

Get the remainder .\nStep 6 Since the remainder is 0 and no digits are left in the given number, therefore,\n529 = 23.\n•Now consider 4096\nStep 1 Place a bar over every pair of digits starting from the one’ s digit. ( 40 96 ).\nStep 2 Find the largest number whose square is less than or equal to the number under\nthe left-most bar (62 < 40 < 72). Take this number as the divisor and the number\nunder the left-most bar as the dividend. Divide and get the remainder i.e., 4 inthis case.\nStep 3 Bring down the number under the next bar  (i.e., 96) to the right of the remainder .\nThe new dividend is 496.\nStep 4 Double the quotient and enter it with a blank on its right.\nStep 5 Guess a largest possible digit to fill the blank which also becomes the new digit in thequotient such that when the new digit is multiplied to the new quotient the product isless than or equal to the dividend. In this case we see that 124 × 4 = 496.\nSo the new digit in the quotient is 4. Get the remainder .\nStep 6 Since the remainder is 0 and no bar left, therefore, \n4096  = 64.\nEstimating the numberWe use bars to find the number of digits in the square root of a perfect square number .\n529 = 23          and         4096 = 64\nIn both the numbers 529 and 4096 there are two bars and the number of digits in their\nsquare root is 2.

It shows that 742 is less than 5607 by 131.\nThis means if we subtract the remainder from the number, we get a perfect square.\nTherefore, the required perfect square is 5607 – 131 = 5476.

This shows 992 is less than 9999 by 198.\nThis means if we subtract the remainder from the number, we get a perfect square.\nTherefore, the required perfect square is 9999 – 198 = 9801.\nAnd,  9801  = 99\nExample  12: Find the least number that must be added to 1300 so as to get a\nperfect square.

Write the number under the next bar (i.e., 64) to the right of\nthis remainder , to get 164.\nStep 4 Double the divisor and enter it with a blank on its right.\nSince 64 is the decimal part so put a decimal point in the\nquotient.\nStep 5 We know 82 × 2 = 164, therefore, the new digit is 2.Divide and get the remainder .\nStep 6 Since the remainder is 0 and no bar left, therefore \n17.64 4.2 = .\nExample  13: Find the square root of 12.25.\nSolution:\nWhich way to move\nConsider a number 176.341. Put bars on both integral part and decimal part. In what way\nis putting bars on decimal part different from integral part? Notice for 176 we start fromthe unit’ s place close to the decimal and move towards left. The first bar is over 76 and the\nsecond bar over 1.

Ramanujan. Once\nanother famous mathematician Prof. G.H. Hardy came to visit him in a taxi whose number\nwas 1729. While talking to Ramanujan, Hardy described this number“a dull number”. Ramanujan quickly pointed out that 1729 was indeed\ninteresting. He said it is the smallest  number that can be expressed\nas a sum of two cubes in two different ways:\n1729 = 1728 + 1 = 12\n3 + 13\n1729 = 1000 + 729 = 103 + 93\n1729 has since been known as the Hardy – Ramanujan Number,\neven though this feature of 1729 was known more than 300 yearsbefore Ramanujan.\nHow did Ramanujan know this? Well, he loved numbers. All\nthrough his life, he experimented with numbers. He probably foundnumbers that were expressed as the sum of two squares and sum oftwo cubes also.\nThere are many other interesting patterns of cubes. Let us learn about cubes, cube\nroots and many other interesting facts related to them.\n6.2  Cubes\nYou know that the word ‘cube’  is used in geometry . A cube is\na solid figure which has all its sides equal. How many cubes of\nside 1 cm will make a cube of side 2 cm?\nHow many cubes of side 1 cm will make a cube of side 3 cm?Consider the numbers 1, 8, 27, ...\nThese are called perfect cubes or cube numbers . Can you say why\nthey are named so? Each of them is obtained when a number is multiplied by\ntaking it three times.\nHardy – Ramanujan\nNumber\n1729 is the smallest Hardy–\nRamanujan Number .

No, as 9 = 3 × 3 and there is no natural number which multiplied\nby taking three times gives 9. We can see also that 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 and 3 × 3 × 3 = 27. This\nshows that 9 is not a perfect cube.\nThe following are the cubes of numbers from 1 to 10.\nTable 1\nNumber Cube\n1 13 = 1\n2 23 = 8\n3 33 = 27\n4 43 = 64\n 5 53 = ____\n6 63 = ____\n7 73 = ____\n8 83 = ____\n9 93 = ____\n10 103 = ____\nThere are only ten perfect cubes from 1 to 1000. (Check this). How many perfect\ncubes are there from 1 to 100?\nObserve the cubes of even numbers. Are they all even?

Is 216 a perfect cube?\nBy prime factorisation, 216 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3\nEach factor appears 3 times. 216 = 23 × 33 = (2 × 3)3\n= 63   which is a perfect cube!\nIs 729 a perfect cube? 729 = 3 × 3 × 3  × 3 × 3 × 3\nYes, 729 is a perfect cube.\nNow let us check for 500.\nPrime factorisation of 500 is 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5 .\nSo, 500 is not a perfect cube.\nExample 1: Is 243 a perfect cube?\nSolution: 243 = 3 × 3 × 3  × 3 × 3\nIn the above factorisation 3 × 3 remains after grouping the 3’s in triplets. Therefore , 243 is\nnot a perfect cube.\nWhich of the following are perfect cubes?\n1.400 2.3375 3.8000 4.15625\n5.9000 6.6859 7.2025 8.10648\n6.2.2  Smallest multiple that is a per fect cube\nRaj made a cuboid of plasticine. Length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15 cm,\n30 cm, 15 cm respectively .\nAnu asks how many such cuboids will she need to make a perfect cube? Can you tell?\nRaj said, V olume of cuboid is 15 × 30 × 15  = 3 × 5 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 3 × 5\n  =2 × 3 × 3 × 3  × 5 × 5 × 5\nSince there is only one 2 in the prime factorisation. So we need 2 × 2, i.e., 4 to make\nit a perfect cube. Therefore, we need 4 such cuboids to make a cube.\nExample 2: Is 392 a perfect cube? If not, find the smallest natural number by which\n392 must be multiplied so that the product is a perfect cube.\nSolution: 392 = 2 × 2 × 2  × 7 × 7\nThe prime factor 7 does not appear in a group of three. Therefore, 392 is not a perfect\ncube. To make its a cube, we need one more 7. In that case\n392 × 7 = 2 × 2 × 2  × 7 × 7 × 7  = 2744           which is a perfect cube.factors can be\ngrouped in triples\nThere are three\n5’s in the product but\nonly two 2’ s.\nDo you remember that\nam × bm = (a × b)m2 216\n2 108\n2 54\n3 27\n39\n33\n1\nReprint 2024-25\n\n\nTHINK, DISCUSS AND WRITEHence the smallest natural number by which 392 should be multiplied to make a perfect\ncube is 7.\nExample 3: Is 53240 a perfect cube? If not, then by which smallest natural number\nshould 53240 be divided so that the quotient is a perfect cube?Solution: 53240 = \n2 × 2 × 2 × 11 × 1 1 × 1 1 × 5\nThe prime factor 5 does not appear in a group of three. So, 53240 is not a perfect cube.\nIn the factorisation 5 appears only one time. If we divide the number by 5, then the prime\nfactorisation of the quotient will not contain 5.\nSo, 53240 ÷ 5 =2 × 2 × 2  × 11 × 1 1 × 1 1\nHence the smallest number by which 53240 should be divided to make it a perfect\ncube is 5.\nThe perfect cube in that case is = 10648.\nExample 4: Is 1188 a perfect cube? If not, by which smallest natural number should\n1188 be divided so that the quotient is a perfect cube?\nSolution: 1188 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3  × 11\nThe primes 2 and 11 do not appear in groups of three. So, 1188 is not a perfect cube. In\nthe factorisation of 1 188 the prime 2 appears only two times and the prime 1 1 appears\nonce. So, if we divide 1 188 by 2 × 2 × 11 = 44, then the prime factorisation of the\nquotient will not contain 2 and 1 1.\nHence the smallest natural number by which 1188 should be divided to make it a\nperfect cube is 44.\nAnd the resulting perfect cube is 1 188 ÷ 44 = 27 (=33).\nExample 5: Is 68600 a perfect cube? If not, find the smallest number by which 68600\nmust be multiplied to get a perfect cube.\nSolution: We have, 68600 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 7 × 7 × 7. In this factorisation, we\nfind that there is no triplet of 5.\nSo, 68600 is not a perfect cube. To make it   a perfect cube we multiply it by 5.\nThus, 68600 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 7 × 7 × 7\n=343000,   which is a perfect cube.\nObserve that 343 is a perfect cube.

We write each expression to be added in a separate\nrow. While doing so we write like terms one below the other , and add them, as shown.\nThus 5 + (–10) = 5 –10 = –5. Similarly , – 4x + 9x = (– 4 + 9)\nx = 5x. Let us take some\nmore examples.\nExample 1: Add: 7xy  + 5yz – 3zx, 4yz + 9zx – 4y , –3xz + 5x – 2xy.\nSolution: Writing the three expressions in separate rows, with like terms one below\nthe other , we have\n7xy + 5yz  –3zx\n+ 4yz  + 9zx        – 4 y\n+–2xy –3\nzx + 5x (Note xz is same as zx)\n5xy  +  9yz  +3zx + 5x – 4y\nThus, the sum of the expressions is 5 xy + 9yz + 3zx + 5x – 4y.

In this game a person is\nblind-folded and has to catch the\nremaining players. How is the blind-\nfolded person able to guess which player\nis closest to her?Sound plays an important role in our\nlives. It helps us to communicate with\none another . We hear a variety of sounds\nin our surroundings.\nMake a list of sounds you hear in\nyour surroundings.\nIn the music room of your school you\nhear the sounds  produced by musical\ninstruments like flute, \ntabla ,\nharmonium, etc. (Fig. 10.1).\nHow is sound produced? How does it\ntravel from one place to another ? How\ndo we hear sound? Why are some sounds\nlouder than others?

Again touch it when\nproducing sound. Can you feel it\nvibrating?\nActivity 10.1\nTake a metal plate (or a pan). Hang\nit at a convenient place in such a\nway that it does not touch any wall.\nNow strike it with a stick (Fig.10.2).\nDo you hear a sound? Touch the\nplate or pan gently with your finger .\nDo you feel the vibrations?\nFig. 10.2 : Striking a pan\nAgain strike the plate with the stick\nand hold it tightly with your hands\nimmediately after striking. Do you\nstill hear the sound?  Touch the\nplate after it stops producing sound.\nCan you feel the vibrations now?As you learnt in Class VII the to and\nfro or back and forth motion of an\nobject is called vibration . When a\ntightly stretched band is plucked, it\nvibrates and produces sound. When it\nstops vibrating, it does not produce\nany sound.\nActivity 10.3\nTake a metal dish. Pour water in it.\nStrike it at its edge with a spoon\n(Fig. 13.4). Do you hear a sound?\nAgain strike the dish and then\ntouch it. Can you feel the dish\nvibrating? Strike the dish again.\nLook at the sur face of water . Do you\nsee any waves there? Now hold the\ndish. What change do you observe\non the sur face of water? Can you\nexplain the change? Is there a hint\nto connect sound with the\nvibrations of a body?\nActivity 10.2\nTake a rubber band. Put it around\nthe longer side of a pencil box\n(Fig. 10.3). Insert two pencils\nbetween the box and the stretched\nrubber . Now, pluck the rubber band\nsomewhere in the middle. Do you\nhear any sound?

But\nin most cases, their amplitude is so small\nthat we cannot see them. However , we\ncan feel them.\nActivity 10.4\nTake a hollow coconut shell and\nmake a musical instrument ektara.\nYou can also make it with the help\nof an earthen pot (Fig. 10.5).

Put your hand on\nyour throat as shown in Fig. 10.8. Do\nyou feel any vibrations?\nIn humans, the sound is produced\nby the voice box  or the larynx . Put your\nfingers on the throat and find a hard\nbump that seems to move when you\nswallow. This part of the body is known\nas the voice box. It is at the upper end\nof the windpipe. Two vocal cords,\n are\nstretched across the voice box or larynx\nin such a way that it leaves a narrow\nslit between them for the passage of air\n(Fig.10.8).\nFig. 10.7 :  Jaltrang\nWhen we pluck the string of an\ninstrument, like the sitar , the sound\nthat we hear is not only that of the\nstring. The whole instrument is forced\nto vibrate, and it is the sound of the\nvibration of the instrument that we\nhear. Similarly, when we strike the\nmembrane of a mridangam , the sound\nthat we hear is not only that of the\nmembrane but of the whole body of\nthe instrument.When we speak, does\nany part of our body\nvibrate?\nFig.10.8 : Voice box in humans\nWhen the lungs force air through the\nslit, the vocal cords vibrate, producing\nsound. Muscles attached to the vocal\ncords can make the cords tight or loose.\nWhen the vocal cords are tight and thin,\nthe type or quality of voice is differentActivity 10.5\nTake 6-8 bowls or tumblers. Fill\nthem with water up to  different\nlevels, increasing gradually from\none end to the other . Now take\na  pencil and strike the bowls gently.\nStrike all of them in succession. Y ou\nwill hear pleasant sounds. This is\nyour jaltrang (Fig.10.7).\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 127from that when they are loose and\nthick. Let us see how the vocal cords\nfunction.\nActivity 10.6\nTake two rubber strips of the same\nsize. Place these two pieces one\nabove the other and stretch them\ntight. Now blow air through the gap\nbetween them [Fig. 10.9(a)]. As the\nair blows through the stretched\nrubber strips, a sound is produced.\nYou can also take a piece of paper\nwith a narrow slit and hold it\nbetween your fingers as shown in\nFig. 10.9 (b). Now blow through the\nslit and listen to the sound. Our\nvocal cords produce sound in a\nsimilar manner .\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 10.9 (a), (b) : Working of vocal cor ds\nThe vocal cords in men are about\n20 mm long. In women these are about\n15mm long. Children have very short\nvocal cords. This is the reason why\nthe voices of men, women and\nchildren are different.\n10.3 Sound Needs a Medium\nfor Propagation\nWhen you call up your friend who is\nstanding at a distance, your friend is\nable to hear your voice. How does the\nsound propagate or  travel to her?\nActivity 10.7\nTake a metal  or glass tumbler . Make\nsure that it is dry. Place a cell phone\nin it. (Remember that the cell phone\nmust not be kept in water .) Ask your\nfriend to give a ring on this cell\nphone from another cell phone.\nListen to the ring carefully.\nNow, surround the rim of the\ntumbler with your hands\n(Fig. 10.10). Put your mouth on the\nFig. 10.10 : Sound needs a medium to travel\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 128Place your ear gently on the water\nsurface (Fig. 10.11). (Be car eful : the\nwater should not enter in your ear .)\nCan you hear the sound of the bell?\nDoes it indicate that sound can\ntravel through liquids?\nopening between your hands.\nIndicate to your friend to give a ring\nagain. Listen to the ring while\nsucking air fr om the tumbler .\nDoes the sound become fainter\nas you suck air?\nRemove the tumbler from your\nmouth. Does the sound become\nloud again?\nCan you think of an explanation? Is\nit possible that the decreasing amount\nof air in the tumbler had something to\ndo with decreasing loudness  of the ring?\nIndeed, if you had been able to suck\nall the air in the tumbler , you will not\nlisten any sound . Actually, sound needs\na medium to travel. When air has been\nremoved completely from a vessel, it is said\nthat there is  a vacuum in the vessel. The\nsound  cannot travel through a  vacuum.\nDoes sound travel in liquids? Let us\nfind out.\nActivity 10.8\nTake a bucket or a bathtub. Fill it\nwith clean water . Take a small bell\nin one hand. Shake this bell inside\nthe water to produce sound. Make\nsure that the bell does not touch\nthe body of the bucket or the tub.Oh ! That is how whales\nand dolphins might be\ncommunicating under\nwater .\nFig. 10.11  : Sound travelling through waterFig. 10.12 : Sound travelling through a\nmetre scale\nCan you hear the sound of the\nscratching? Ask your friends\naround you if they were able to hear\nthe same sound?Let us find out if sound can travel\nthrough solids also.\nActivity 10.9\nTake a metre scale or a long metal\nrod and hold its one end to your\near. Ask your friend to gently\nscratch or tap at the other end of\nthe scale (Fig. 10.12).\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 129You can also per form the above\nactivity by placing your ear at one end\nof a long wooden or metallic table and\nasking your friend to gently scratch the\nother end of the table (Fig. 10.13).\nFig. 10.13 :  Sound can travel through solids\nWe find that sound can travel\nthrough wood or metal. In fact, sound\ncan travel thr ough any solid. Y ou can\nperform inter esting activities to show\nthat sound can also travel through\nstrings. Have you ever made a toy\ntelephone (Fig. 10.14). Can you say that\nsound can travel through strings?\nFig. 10.14 : A toy telephone\nWe have lear nt so far that vibrating\nobjects produce sound and it is carried\nin all directions in a medium. The\nmedium could be a gas, a liquid or a\nsolid. How do we hear it?\nFig. 10.15 : Understanding action of an eardrum10.4 We Hear Sound thr ough\nOur Ears\nThe shape of the outer part of the ear is\nlike a funnel. When sound enters it, it\ntravels down a canal at the end of which\nthere is a thin stretched membrane. It\nis called the eardrum. It per forms an\nimportant function. To understand what\nthe eardrum does, let us build a tin-can\nmodel of the eardrum.\nActivity 10.10\nTake a plastic or tin-can. Cut its\nends. Stretch a piece of rubber\nballoon across one end of the can\nand fasten it with a rubber band.\nPut four or five grains of dry cereal\non the str etched rubber . Now ask\nyour friend to speak “Hurrey,\nHurrey” from the open end\n(Fig.10.15). Observe what  happens\nto the grain. Why do the grains\njump up and down?\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 130The eardrum is like a stretched\nrubber sheet. Sound vibrations make\nthe eardrum vibrate (Fig. 10.16). The\neardrum sends vibrations to the inner\near. From ther e, the signal goes to the\nbrain. That is how we hear .You have alr eady lear nt in earlier classes\nabout the oscillatory motion and its\ntime period.\nThe number of oscillations  per\nsecond is called the frequency  of\noscillation. Frequency is expressed in\nhertz . Its symbol is Hz. A frequency of\n1 Hz is one oscillation per second. If an\nobject oscillates 20 times in one second,\nwhat would be its frequency?\nYou can r ecognise many familiar\nsounds without seeing the objects\nproducing them. How is it possible?\nThese sounds must be different to\nenable you to recognise them. Have you\never thought what factors make them\ndifferent?  Amplitude  and frequency are\ntwo important properties of any sound.\nCan we differentiate sounds on the basis\nof their amplitudes and frequencies?\nLoudness and Pitch\nActivity 10.11\nTake a metallic tumbler and a\ntablespoon. Strike the tablespoon\ngently at the brim of the tumbler .Fig. 10.16 : Human ear\nFig. 10.17 : Thermocol ball touching the\nvibrating glass tumblerWe must NEVER put a sharp,\npointed or hard thing into our\near. It can damage the\neardrum. The damaged\neardrum can impair hearing.\n10.5 Amplitude, T ime Period\nand Frequency of a\nVibration\nWe have lear nt that the to and fr o motion\nof an object is known as vibration. This\nmotion is also called oscillatory motion .Eardrum\nInner ear\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 131Hear the sound produced. Now bang\nthe spoon on the tumbler and hear\nthe sound produced again. Is the\nsound louder when the tumbler is\nstruck hard?\nNow suspend a small thermocol\nball touching the rim of the tumbler\n(Fig. 10.17). Vibrate the tumbler by\nstriking it. See how far the ball is\ndisplaced. The displacement of the\nball is a measure of the amplitude\nof vibration of the tumbler .\nNow, strike the tumbler gently\nand then a little har der. Compar e\nthe amplitudes of vibrations of the\ntumbler in the two cases. In which\ncase is the amplitude larger?\nLoudness of sound is proportional to\nthe square of the amplitude of the\nvibration producing the sound. For\nexample, if the amplitude becomes\ntwice, the loudness increases by a\nfactor of 4. The loudness is expressed\nin a unit called decibel (dB). The\nfollowing table gives some idea of the\nloudness of sound coming from\nvarious sources.\nNormal breathing 10 dB\nSoft whisper (at 5m) 30 dB\nNormal conversation 60 dB\nBusy traffic 70 dB\nAverage factory 80 dB\nAbove 80 dB the noise becomes\nphysically painful.I wonder why my voice\nis different from that of\nmy teacher .\nCompare the sound of a baby with\nthat of an adult. Is there any difference?\nEven if two sounds are equally loud,\nthey differ in some way. Let us see how.\nFig. 10.18 : Frequency determines the\npitch of a soundThe loudness of sound depends on\nits amplitude. When the amplitude of\nvibration is large, the sound produced\nis loud. When the amplitude is small,\nthe sound produced is feeble.The frequency determines the\nshrillness or pitch  of a sound. If the\nfrequency of vibration is higher we say\nthat the sound is shrill and has a higher\npitch. If the frequency of vibration is\nlower , we say that the sound has a lower\npitch. For example, a drum vibrates with\na low frequency. Therefore, it produces\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 132a low-pitched sound. On the other\nhand, a whistle has a high frequency\nand therefore, produces a sound of\nhigher pitch (Fig. 10.18). A bird makes\na high-pitched sound whereas a lion\nmakes a low-pitched r oar. However , the\nroar of a lion is very loud while the\nsound of the bird is quite feeble.\nEvery day you hear the voices of\nchildren and adults. Do you find any\ndifference in their voices? Can you say\nthat the frequency of the voice of a child\nis higher than that of an adult?\nUsually the voice of a woman has\na higher  frequency than that of a\nman.\n10.6 Audible and Inaudible\nSounds\nWe know that we need a vibrating body\nfor the production of sound. Can we\nhear the sound of all vibrating bodies?\nThe fact is that sounds of frequencies\nless than about 20 vibrations per second\n(20 Hz) cannot be detected by the  human\near. Such sounds ar e called inau dible.\nOn the higher side, sounds of  frequencies\nhigher\n than about 20,000 vibrations per\nsecond (20 kHz) are also not audible to\nthe  human ear . Thus, for human ear,\nthe range of audible frequencies is\nroughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz.\nSome animals can hear sounds of\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.\nDogs have this ability. The police use\nhigh frequency whistles which dogs can\nhear but humans cannot.\nThe ultrasound equipment, familiar\nto us for investigating and tracking\nmany medical problems, works at\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.10.7 Noise and Music\nWe hear dif ferent types of sounds\naround us. Is the sound always\npleasing? Does a sound sometimes\ncause discomfort to you? Some sounds\nare pleasant to the ear , wher eas some\nare not.\nSuppose construction work is going\non in your neighbourhood. Are the\nsounds coming from the construction\nsite pleasing ? Do you enjoy the sounds\nproduced by horns of buses and trucks?\nSuch unpleasant sounds are called\nnoise . In a classroom, if all the students\nspeak together , what would the sound\nproduced be called?\nOn the other hand you enjoy sounds\nfrom musical instruments.  Musical\nsound is one which is pleasing to the\near. Sound pr\noduced by a harmonium\nis a musical sound. The string of a sitar\nalso gives out a musical sound.  But, if\na musical sound becomes too loud,\nwould it remain melodious ?\n10.8 Noise Pollution\nYou alr eady know about air pollution.\nPresence of unwanted gases and\nparticles in air is called air pollution.\nSimilarly, presence of excessive or\nunwanted sounds in the environment\nis called noise pollution. Can you list\nsome sources of noise pollution? Major\ncauses of noise pollution are sounds of\nvehicles, explosions including bursting\nof crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc.\nWhat sources in the home may lead to\nnoise? Television and transistor radio\nat high volumes, some kitchen\nappliances, desert coolers, air\nconditioners, all contribute to noise\npollution.\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 133Hearing Impairment\nTotal hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial\ndisability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with\nimpaired hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children\ncan communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of\nhearing, a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also.\nTechnological devices for the hearing-impaired have made it possible for such\npersons to improve their quality of life. Society can do much to  improve the\nliving environment for the hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives.What are the Harms of Noise\nPollution?\nDo you know that presence of excessive\nnoise in the surroundings may cause\nmany health related problems. Lack of\nsleep, hypertension (high blood-\npressure), anxiety and many more health\ndisorders may be caused by noise\npollution. A person who is exposed to a\nloud sound continuously may get\ntemporary or even permanent\nimpairment of hearing.\nMeasures to Limit Noise Pollution\nTo control noise, we  must control the\nsources of noise. How can this be\nachieved? For this, silencing devicesmust be installed in air  craft engines,\ntransport vehicles, industrial\nmachines and home appliances.\nHow can the noise pollution be\ncontrolled in a residential area?\nAll noisy operations must be\nconducted away from any residential\narea. Noise producing industries\nshould be set up away from such\nareas. Use of automobile horns\nshould be minimi s\ned. TV and music\nsystems should be run at low\nvolumes. Trees must be planted along\nthe roads and around buildings to\ncut down on the sounds reaching the\nresidents, thus reducing the harmful\neffects of noise pollution.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 134\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nAMPLITUDE\nEARDRUM\nFREQUENCY\nhertz  (Hz)\nLARYNX\nLOUDNESS\nNOISE\nOSCILLA TION\nPITCH\nTIME PERIOD\nVIBRA TION\nVOICE BOX\nWIND PIPE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\nÜSound is produced by vibrating objects.\nÜIn human beings, the vibration of the vocal\ncords produces sound.\nÜSound travels through a medium (gas, liquid\nor solid).

This was devised as a warning system. If a guard saw a\nsuspicious movement outside the fort, he clapped at the particular\npoint under the dome, and the army inside the fort was alerted to\nthe danger of the approaching enemy.\n2024-25\n"}

But\ndo you know why it is dangerous to\ntouch an electrical appliance with wet\nhands?\nWe have lear nt earlier that the\nmaterials, which allow electric current\nto pass through them, are good\nconductors of electricity. On the other\nhand, materials, which do not allow\nelectric current to pass through them\neasily, are poor conductors of electricity.\nIn Class VI, we made a tester  to test\nwhether a particular material allows the\nelectric current to pass through it or not.\nDo you recall how the tester helped us\nin deciding that?\nWe found that metals such as copper\nand aluminium conduct electricity\nwher eas materials such as rubber ,plastic and wood do not conduct\nelectricity. However , so far we have used\nour tester to test materials which were\nin solid state. But what about liquids?\nDo liquids also conduct electricity? Let\nus find out.\nPaheli and Boojho want to\nremind you that one\nshould not experiment\nwith the electric supply\nfrom the mains or a\ngenerator or an inverter .\nUse only electric cells for\nall the activities suggested\nhere.\nFig.11.1 :  A tester11.1 Do Liquids Conduct\nElectricity?\nTo test whether a liquid allows electric\ncurrent to pass through it or not, we\ncan use the same tester (Fig .11.1).\n2024-25\n\nHowever , replace the cell by a battery.\nAlso, before using the tester we\nshould check whether it is working\nor not.\nActivity 11.1\nJoin the free ends of the tester\ntogether for a moment.

If they\nare, then replace the bulb with\nanother bulb. Now test if the tester\nis working or not. If it is still not\nworking then replace the cells with\nfresh cells.\nNow that our tester is working, let\nus use it to test the various liquids.\n(Caution: While checking your tester ,\ndo not join its free ends for more than a\nfew seconds. Otherwise the cells of the\nbattery will drain very quickly.)\nActivity 11.2\nCollect a few small plastic or rubber\ncaps of discarded bottles and clean\nthem. Pour one teaspoon of lemon\njuice or vinegar in one cap. Bring\nyour tester over this cap and let the\nends of the tester dip into lemon juice\nor vinegar as shown in Fig. 11.2. Take\ncare that the ends are not more than\n1 cm apart but at the same time do\nnot touch each other . Does the bulbFig. 11.2 :  Testing conduction of electricity in\nlemon juice or vinegarof the tester glow? Does lemon juice\nor vinegar conduct electricity? How\nwould you classify lemon juice or\nvinegar — a good conductor or a poor\nconductor?\nWhen the liquid between the two\nends of the tester allows the electric\ncurrent to pass, the circuit of the tester\nbecomes complete. The current flows in\nthe circuit and the bulb glows. When\nthe liquid does not allow the electric\ncurrent to pass, the circuit of the tester\nis not complete and the bulb does not\nglow.\nIn some situations even though the\nliquid is conducting, the bulb may not\nglow . It may have happened in\nActivity 11.2 . What can be the reason?\nDo you remember why the bulb\nglows when the electric current passes\nthrough it? Due to the heating effect\nof current, the filament of the bulb gets\nheated to a high temperature and it\nstarts glowing. However , if the current\nthrough a circuit is too weak, the\nfilament does not get heated\nCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT 139\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 140Activity 11.3\nTake the tray from inside a discarded\nmatchbox. W rap an electric wir e a few\ntimes around the tray. Place a small\ncompass needle inside it. Now\nconnect one free end of the wire to\nthe terminal of a battery. Leave the\nother end free. Take another piece of\nwire and connect it to the other\nterminal of the battery (Fig. 11\n.4).\nFig 11.4 :  Another testersufficiently and it does not glow. And\nwhy is the current in the circuit weak?\nWell, though a material may conduct\nelectricity, it may not conduct it as\neasily as a metal. As a result, the\ncircuit of the tester may be complete\nand yet the current through it may be\ntoo weak to make the bulb glow. Can\nwe make another tester which can\ndetect a weak current?\nWe can use another ef fect of an electric\ncurrent to make another kind of tester .\nDo you recall that electric current\nproduces a magnetic effect? What\nhappens to a compass needle kept nearby\nwhen current flows in a wire? Even if\nthe current is small, the deflection of the\nmagnetic needle can be seen. Can we\nmake a tester using the magnetic\neffect of currents? Let us find out  in\nActivity 11.3 .\nJoin the free ends of two wires\nmomentarily. The compass needle\nshould show deflection\n. Your tester\nwith two free ends of the wire is ready.\nNow repeat Activity 11.2 using this\ntester . Do you find a deflection in the\ncompass needle the moment you dip\nthe free ends of the tester in lemon\njuice?\nTake out the ends of the tester\nfrom the lemon juice, dip them in\nwater and then wipe them dry.\nRepeat the activity with other liquids\nsuch as tap water , vegetable oil, milk,\nhoney. (Remember to wash and wipe\ndry the ends of tester after testing\neach liquid).  In each case observe\nwhether the magnetic needle shows\ndeflection or not. Record your\nobservations in Table 11.1.\nYou may use an LED (Fig. 11.3) in\nplace of the electric bulb in the tester\nof Fig. 11.2. LED glows even when a\nweak electric current flows through\nit.\nThere are two wires (called leads)\nattached to an LED. One lead is\nslightly longer than the other .\nRemember that while connecting to\na circuit, the longer lead is always\nconnected to the positive terminal of\nthe battery and the shorter lead is\nconnected to the negative terminal of\nthe battery.\nFig. 11.3 : LEDs\n2024-25\n\nCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT 141\nTable 11.1 : Good/Poor Conducting Liquids\nS.No. Material Compass Needle Shows Good Conductor/\nDeflection Y es/No Poor Conductor\n1.

But she has also read\nthat during lightning, an electric\ncurrent passes thr ough air . She\nwonders if air is indeed a poor\nconductor under all conditions.\nThis makes Boojho ask whether\nother materials classified as\npoor conductors also allow\nelectricity to pass under\ncertain conditions.\nFrom Table 11.1, we find that some\nliquids are good conductors of electricity\nand some are poor conductors.\nActually, under certain conditions\nmost materials can conduct. That is why\nit is preferable to classify materials as\ngood conductors and poor conductors\ninstead of classifying as conductors and\ninsulators.We have tested the conduction of\nelectricity thr ough tap water . Let us now\ntest the conduction of electricity through\ndistilled water .\nActivity 11.4\nTake about two teaspoonfuls of\ndistilled water in a clean and dry\nplastic or rubber cap of a bottle. (You\nmay obtain distilled water from your\nschool science lab. Y ou may also get\ndistilled water from a medical store\nor a doctor or a nurse) . Use the tester\nto test whether distilled water\nconducts electricity or not. What do\nyou find? Does distilled water\nconduct electricity? Now dissolve a\npinch of common salt in distilled\nwater . Again test. What do you\nconclude this time?\nWhen salt is dissolved in distilled\nwater , we obtain salt solution. This is a\nconductor of electricity.\nThe water that we get from sources\nsuch as taps, hand pumps, wells and\nponds is not pure. It may contain\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 142several salts dissolved in it. Small\namounts of mineral salts are naturally\npresent in it. This water is thus a good\nconductor of electricity. On the other\nhand, distilled water is free of salts and\nis a poor conductor.Most liquids that conduct electricity\nare solutions of acids, bases and salts.\nWhen an electric current flows\nthrough a conducting solution, does it\nproduce an effect on the solution?\n11.2 Chemical Effects of\nElectric Current\nIn Class VII, we have learnt some effects\nof electric current. Can you list these\neffects? What effect does the current\nproduce when it flows through a\nconducting solution? Let us find out.\nActivity 11.6\nTake out carbon rods carefully from\ntwo discarded cells. Clean their\nmetal caps with sand paper . Wrap\ncopper  wires around the metal caps\nof the carbon rods  and join them to\na battery (Fig. 1 1.5). W e call these\ntwo rods electrodes . (Instead ofSmall amounts of mineral salts\npresent naturally in water are\nbeneficial for human health.\nHowever , these salts make water\na good conductor . So, we should\nnever handle electrical\nappliances with wet hands or\nwhile standing on a wet floor .\nWe have found that common salt,\nwhen dissolved in distilled water , makes\nit a good conductor . What are the other\nsubstances which, when dissolved in\ndistilled water , make it conducting? Let\nus find out.\nCaution: Do the next activity under the\nsupervision of your teacher/parent or\nsome elderly person, because the use of\nacid is involved in it.\nActivity 11.5\nTake three clean plastic or rubber caps\nof bottles. Pour about two teaspoonfuls\nof distilled water in each of them. Add\na few drops of lemon juice or dilute\nhydrochloric acid to distilled water in\none cap. Now in the second cap\ncontaining distilled water , add a few\ndrops of a base such as caustic soda\nor potassium iodide. Add a little sugar\nto the distilled water in the third cap\nand dissolve it.

He cut\na potato into two halves and\ninserted the copper wires of a tester\ninto it. Just then his mother called\nhim and he forgot to take out the\nwires of the tester inserted into the\npotato. When he came back after\nhalf an hour , he noticed that ther e\nwas a greenish blue spot on the\npotato around one wire whereas\nthere was no such spot around the\nother wire (Fig. 11.6).carbon rods, you may take two iron\nnails about 6 cm lon g.) Pour a\ncupful of water in a glass/plastic\nbowl. Add a teaspoonful of salt or a\nfew drops of lemon juice to water to\nmake it more conducting.  Now\nimmerse the electrodes in this\nsolution. Make sure that the metal\ncaps of the carbon rods are outside\nthe water . Wait for 3-4 minute s.\nObserve the electrodes carefully. Do\nyou notice any gas bubbles near the\nelectrodes? Can we  call the change\ntaking place in the solution a\nchemical change? Recall the\ndefinition of a chemical change that\nyou learnt in Class VII.\nIn 1800, a British chemist, William\nNicholson (1753–1815), had shown\nthat if electrodes\nwere immersed\nin water , and a\ncurrent was passed,\nbubbles of oxygen\nand hydrogen were\nproduced. Oxygen\nbubbles formed\non the electrode\nconnected to the positive terminal of\nthe battery and hydrogen bubbles\nformed on the other electrode.\nThe passage of an electric current\nthrough a conducting solution causes\nchemical reactions. As a result, bubbles\nof a gas may be formed on the electrodes.\nDeposits of metal may be seen on\nelectrodes. Changes of colour of\nsolutions may occur . The reaction would\ndepend on what solution and electrodes\nare used. These are some of the chemical\neffects of the electric current.\nFig. 11.6 :  Testing potato\nHe was surprised with this\nobservation and along with Paheli\nrepeated this activity many times. They\nfound that it was always the wire\nconnected to the positive terminal,\nwhich had a greenish blue spot around\nit. They felt that this discovery was very\nuseful because it could be used for\nidentifying the positive terminal of a\ncell or a battery  concealed in a box.\nThey decided to report their finding to\na children’s magazine.\nRemember that Boojho set out to\ntest whether potato conducted\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 144Allow the current to pass for\nabout 15 minutes. Now remove the\nelectrodes from the solution and\nlook at them carefully. Do you find\nany difference in any one of them?\nDo you find a coating over it? What\ncolour is the coating ? Note down \nthe\nterminal of the battery with which\nthis electrode is connected.electricity or not. What he found was\nthat current produced a chemical\neffect in the potato. To him this was\nvery exciting. In fact, this is how\nscience sometimes works. Y ou ar e\nlooking for something and you\ndiscover something else. Many\nimportant discoveries have been\nmade in this manner .\n11.3 Electroplating\nYou know  that a brand new bicycle has\nshiny handlebar and wheel rims.\nHowever , if these ar e accidentally\nscratched, the shiny coating comes off\nrevealing a not so shiny sur face beneath.\nYou might have also seen women using\nornaments, which appear  to be made of\ngold. However , with r epeated use, the\ngold coating wears off, revealing silver or\nsome other metal beneath.\nIn both these cases, a metal has a\ncoating of another metal. Do you wonder\nhow a layer of one metal can be\ndeposited on top of another? W ell, let\nus try doing it ourselves.\nActivity 11.7\nWe will need copper sulphate and\ntwo copper plates of size around\n10 cm × 4 cm. T ake 250 mL of\ndistilled water in a clean and dry\nbeaker . Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of\ncopper sulphate in it. Add a few drops\nof dilute sulphuric acid to copper\nsulphate solution to make it more\nconducting. Clean copper plates with\nsand paper . Now rinse them with\nwater and dry them.  Connect the\ncopper plate s to the terminals of a\nbattery \nand immerse them in copper\nsulphate solution (Fig. 11.7).When electric current is passed\nthrough the copper sulphate solution,\ncopper sulphate dissociates into\ncopper and sulphate. The free copper\ngets drawn to the electrode connected\nto the negative terminal of the battery\nand gets deposited on it.  But what\nabout the loss of copper from the\nsolution?\nFrom the other electrode, a  copper\nplate, an equal amount of copper gets\ndissolved in the solution. Thus, the\nAfter doing the electroplating\nactivity, Paheli interchanged\nthe electrodes and repeated\nthe activity. What do you think\nshe would observe this time?\nFig.1 1.7 : A simple circuit showing\nelectroplatingCopper plate\nCopper sul-\nphate\nsolutionCopper plate\n2024-25\n\nCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT 145\nloss of copper from the solution is\nrestored  and the process continues .\nThis means that copper gets\ntransferred from one electrode to the\nother .\nIn the electroplating factories the\ndisposal of the used conducting\nsolution is a major concern. It is a\npolluting waste and there are specific\ndisposal guidelines to protect the\nenvironment.Fig. 11.8 :  Some electroplated objects\nsilver and gold on less expensive metals.\nThese ornaments have the appearance\nof silver or gold but are much less\nexpensive.\nTin cans, used for storing food, ar e\nmade by electr oplating tin onto ir on. T in\nis less reactive than iron. Thus, food\ndoes not come into contact with iron and\nis protected from getting spoilt.\nIron is used in bridges and\nautomobiles to provide strength.\nHowever , iron tends to corr ode and rust.\nSo, a coating of zinc is deposited on iron\nto protect it from corrosion and\nformation of rust.\nBoojho could get only one\ncopper plate. So he\nperformed Activity 11.7 by\nconnecting a carbon rod in\nplace of the copper plate\nwhich was connected to\nthe negative terminal of\nthe battery. He succeeded\nin obtaining a coating of\ncopper on carbon rod.\nThe process of depositing a layer of\nany desired metal on another material\nby means of electricity is called\nelectroplating . It is one of the most\ncommon applications of chemical effects\nof electric current.\nElectroplating is a very useful\nprocess. It is widely used in industry\nfor coating metal objects with a thin\nlayer of a different metal (Fig.11.8). The\nlayer of metal deposited has some\ndesired property, which the metal of the\nobject lacks. For example, chromium\nplating is done on many objects such\nas car parts, bath taps, kitchen gas\nburners, bicycle handlebars, wheel rims\nand many others.\nChromium has a shiny appearance.\nIt does not corrode. It resists scratches.\nHowever , chromium is expensive and it\nmay not be economical to make the\nwhole object out of chromium. So the\nobject is made from a cheaper metal and\nonly a coating of chromium over it is\ndeposited.

These\nare lightning and earthquakes. W e shall\nalso discuss what steps we can take to\nminimise destruction caused by\nthese phenomena.\n12.1Lightning\nYou might have seen sparks on a\nelectric pole when wires become loose.\nThis phenomenon is quite common\nwhen wind is blowing and shaking the\nwires. You might also have seen sparks\nwhen a plug is loose in its socket.\nLightning is also an electric spark, but\non a huge scale.\nIn ancient times, people did not\nunderstand the cause of these sparks.\nThey were, therefore, afraid of lightning\nand thought that the wrath of gods was\nvisiting them. Now, of course, we\nunderstand that lightning is caused by\nthe accumulation of charges in the\nclouds. W e need not be afraid of\nlightning, but we have to take\nprecautions to protect ourselves from\nthe deadly sparks.\nThe Sparks that the Greeks Knew\nAbout\nThe ancient Greeks knew as early as\n600 B.C. that when amber (amber is akind of r esin) was rubbed with fur , it\nattracted light objects such as hair . You\nmight have seen that when you take\noff woollen or polyester clothes, your\nhair stands on end. If you take off these\nclothes in the dark, you even see a\nspark and hear a crackling sound. In\n1752 Benjamin Franklin, an American\nscientist, showed that lightning and the\nspark  from your clothes are essentially\nthe same phenomena. However , it took\n2000 years for this r ealisation to occur .\nWe shall now study some pr operties\nof electric char ges. W e shall also see how\nthey are related to the lightning in the\nsky.\nLet us per form some activities to\nunderstand the nature of electric\ncharges. But recall first what you might\nhave played as a game. When you rub\nI wonder why they took so\nmany years to realise the\nsimilarity.\nScientific discoveries are a\nresult of hardwork by many\npeople. It can sometimes take\na long time.\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 151\na plastic scale on your dry hair, the\nscale can attract very small pieces of\npaper.\n12.2 Charging by Rubbing\nActivity 12.1\nTake a used ballpen refill and rub\nit vigorously with a piece of\npolythene. Bring it close to small\npieces of paper. Take care not to\ntouch the rubbed end of the refill\nwith your hand or with a metallic\nobject. Repeat the activity withsmall pieces of dry leaf, husk and\nmustard seeds. Record your\nobservations.\nWhen a plastic refill is rubbed with\npolythene, it acquires a small electric\ncharge. Similarly, when a plastic comb\nis rubbed with dry hair, it acquires a\nsmall charge. These objects are called\ncharged objects . In the process of\ncharging the refill and the plastic comb,\npolythene and hair also get charged.\nLet’s try to charge some other\nobjects  that are familiar to you.\nTable 12.1\nObjects Rubbed Materials Attracts/does not Charged/\nUsed for Rubbing Attract Pieces Not Charged\nof Paper\nRefill Polythene,\nwoollen cloth\nBalloon Polythene, woollen\ncloth, dry hair\nEraser Wool\nSteel spoon Polythene,\nwoollen clothActivity 12.2\nCollect the objects and the materials listed in Table 12.1.

Hang them\nin such a way that they do not touch\neach other (Fig. 15.1). Rub both the\nballoons with a woollen cloth and\nrelease them. What do you observe?Rub the other refill also with\npolythene. Bring it close to the\ncharged refill. Be careful not to\ntouch the charged end with your\nhand. Is there any effect on the refill\nin the tumbler? Do the two attract\neach other , or repel each other?\nIn this activity we have brought\nclose together the charged objects\nthat were made of the same\nmaterial. What happens if two\ncharged objects made of different\nmaterials are brought close to each\nother? Let’s find out.\n(b) Rub a refill and place it gently in\na glass tumbler as before\n(Fig. 12.3). Bring an inflated charged\nballoon near the refill and observe.\nFig. 12.1 : Like charges repel each other\nFig. 12.2 : Interaction between like chargesNow let us repeat this activity\nwith the used pen refills. Rub one\nrefill with polythene. Place it\ncarefully in a glass tumbler using\nthe tumbler as a stand (Fig. 12.2).\nFig. 12.3 : Unlike charges attract each other\nLet’s summarise the observations:\nlA charged balloon repelled a charged\nballoon.\nlA charged refill repelled a charged\nrefill.\nlBut a charged balloon attracted a\ncharged refill.\nDoes it indicate that the charge on\nthe balloon is of a different kind from\nthe charge on the refill? Can we say\nthen, that there are two kinds of                                 \n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 153charges? Can we also say that the\ncharges of the same kind repel each\nother , while char ges of dif ferent kind\nattract each other?\nIt is a convention to call  the charge\nacquired by a glass rod when it is\nrubbed with silk as positive.  The\nother kind of charge is said to be\nnegative.\nIt is observed that when a charged\nglass rod is brought near a charged\nplastic straw rubbed with polythene\nthere is attraction between the two.\nWhat do you think would be the kind\nof char ge on the plastic straw? Y our\nguess, that the plastic straw would carry\na negative charge is correct.\nThe electrical charges generated by\nrubbing are static. They do not move by\nthemselves. When charges move, they\nconstitute an electric current. Y ou have\nbeen reading about electric current since\nClass VI.  The current in a circuit which\nmakes a bulb glow, or the current that\nmakes a wire hot, is nothing but a\nmotion of charges.\n12.4 Transfer of Char ge\nActivity 12.4\nTake an empty jam bottle. Take a\npiece of cardboard slightly bigger in\nsize than the mouth of the bottle.\nPierce a hole in it so that a metal\npaper clip can be inserted. Open out\nthe paper clip as shown in Fig. 12.4.\nCut two strips of aluminium foil\nabout 4 cm × 1 cm each. Hang them\non the paper clip as shown. Insert\nthe paper clip in the cardboard lid\nso that it is perpendicular to it\n(Fig. 12.4). Charge a refill and touch\nFig 12.4 : A simple electroscopeit with the end of the paper clip.\nObserve what happens. Is there any\neffect on the foil strips? Do they\nrepel each other or attract each\nother? Now, touch other charged\nbodies with the end of the paper clip.\nDo foil strips behave in the same\nway in all cases? Can this apparatus\nbe used to detect whether a body is\ncharged or not? Can you explain\nwhy the foil strips repel each other?\nThe aluminium foil strips receive the\nsame charge from the charged refill\nthrough the paper clip (remember that\nmetals are good conductors of\nelectricity). The strips carrying similar\ncharges repel each other and they\nbecome wide open. Such a device can\nbe used to test whether an object is\ncarrying charge or not. This device is\nknown as electroscope .\nThus, we find that electrical charge\ncan be transferred from a charged object\nto another thr ough a metal conductor .\nTouch the end of the paper clip gently\nwith hand and you will find a change in\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 154the foil strips. They come back to their\noriginal state. Repeat charging of foil\nstrips and touching the paper clip. Every\ntime you will find that the foil strips\ncollapse as soon as you touch the\npaperclip  with hand . Why does it\nhappen? The reason is that the foil strips\nlose charge to the earth through your\nbody. W e say that the foil strips ar e\ndischarged . The process of transfe rring\nof charge from a charged object to the\nearth is called earthing .\nEarthing is provided in buildings to\nprotect us from electrical shocks due\nto any leakage of electrical current.\n12.5 The Story of Lightning\nIt is now possible to explain lightning\nin terms of the charges produced by\nrubbing.During the development of a\nthunderstorm, the air currents move\nupward while the water droplets move\ndownward. These vigorous movements\ncause separation of charges. By a\nprocess, not yet completely understood,\nthe positive charges collect near the\nupper edges of the clouds and the\nnegative charges accumulate near the\nlower edges. There is accumulation of\npositive charges near the ground also.\nWhen the magnitude of the\naccumulated charges becomes very\nlarge, the air which is normally a poor\nconductor of electricity, is no longer able\nto resist their flow. Negative and positive\ncharges meet, producing streaks of\nbright light and sound. W e see str eaks\nas lightning (Fig. 12.5). The process is\ncalled an electric discharge.\nFig. 12.5 : Accumulation of charges leading to lightning.\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 155\nThe process of electric discharge can\noccur between two or more clouds, or\nbetween clouds and the earth. Today we\nneed not get frightened by lightning like\nour ancestors did. Now we understand\nthe basic phenomenon. Scientists are\ntrying hard to improve this\nunderstanding. However , lightning\nstrike could destroy life and property. It\nis, therefore, necessary to take measures\nto protect ourselves.\n12.6 Lightning Safety\nDuring lightning and thunderstorm no\nopen place is safe.\nlHearing thunder is an alert to rush\nto a safer place.\nlAfter hearing the last thunder , wait\nfor some time before coming out of\nthe safe place.\nFinding a Safe Place\nA house or a building is a safe place.\nIf you are travelling by car or by bus,\nyou are safe inside with windows and\ndoors of the vehicle shut.\nDo’s and Don’ts during a\nThunderstorm\nOutside\nOpen vehicles, like motorbikes, tractors,\nconstruction machinery, open cars are\nnot safe. Open fields, tall trees, shelters\nin parks, elevated places do not protect\nus from lightning strokes.\nCarrying an umbrella is not at all a\ngood idea during thunderstorms.\nIf in a forest, take shelter under\nshorter trees.\nIf no shelter is available and you are\nin an open field, stay far away from all\ntrees. Stay away from poles or othermetal objects. Do not lie on the ground.\nInstead, squat low on the ground. Place\nyour hands on your knees with your\nhead between the hands (Fig. 12.6). This\nposition will make you the smallest\ntarget to be struck.\nInside the house\nLightning can strike telephone cords,\nelectrical wires and metal pipes (Do you\nremember , lightning is an electrical\ndischarge?). During a thunderstorm\ncontact with these should be avoided. It\nis safer to use mobile phones and\ncordless phones. However , it is not wise\nto call up a person who is receiving your\nphone through a wired phone.\nBathing should be avoided during\nthunderstorms to avoid contact with\nrunning water .\nElectrical appliances like computer s,\nTVs,\n etc., should be unplugged. Electrical\nlights can remain on . They  do not cause\nany harm.Fig. 12.6 : Safe position during lightning\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 156Lightning Conductors\nLightning Conductor is a device used\nto protect buildings from the effect of\nlightning. A metallic rod, taller than the\nbuilding, is installed in the walls of the\nbuilding during its construction. One\nend of the rod is kept out in the air and\nthe other is buried deep in the ground\n(Fig. 12.7). The rod provides easy route\nfor the transfer of electric charge to the\nground.\nThe metal columns used during\nconstruction, electrical wires and water\npipes in the buildings also protect us to\nan extent. But do not touch them during\na thunderstorm.12.7 Earthquakes\nYou just lear nt about thunderstor m and\nlightning. These natural phenomena can\ncause large scale destruction of human\nlife and property. Fortunately, these\nphenomena can be predicted to some\nextent.  The weather department can\nwarn about a thunderstorm developing\nin some area.\nIf a thunderstorm occurs there is\nalways a possibility of lightning and\ncyclones accompanying it.  So, we get\ntime to take measures to protect\nourselves from the damage caused by\nthese phenomena.\nFig. 12.7 :  Lightning conductorlightning\nconductor\ncopper\nplate\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 157Ther e is, however , one natural\nphenomenon which we are not yet able\nto predict accurately.  It is an\nearthquake.  It can cause damage to\nhuman life and property on a huge scale.\nA major earthquake occurred in\nIndia on 8 October 2005 in Uri and\nTangdhar towns of North Kashmir\n(Fig. 12.8). Before that a major\nearthquake occurred on 26 January\n2001 in Bhuj district of Gujarat.\nActivity 12.5\nAsk your parents about the huge\ndamage to life and property caused\nby these earthquakes.  Collect a few\npictures showing the damagecaused by these earthquakes from\nnewspapers and magazines of those\ndays.  Prepare a short report on the\nsuffering of the people during and\nafter the earthquakes.\nWhat is an earthquake? What\nhappens when it occurs?  What can we\ndo to minimise its effects?  These are\nsome of the questions which we shall\ndiscuss below.\nWhat is an Earthquake?\nAn earthquake is a sudden shaking or\ntrembling of the earth which lasts for a\nvery short time. It is caused by a\ndisturbance deep inside the earth’s\nFig. 12.8 : Kashmir earthquake\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 158My grandmother told me\nthat the earth is balanced\non the horn of a bull and\nwhen the bull shifts it to\nthe other horn, an\nearthquake takes place.\nHow could it be true?\ncrust.  Earthquakes occur all the time,\nall over the earth.  They are not even\nnoticed.  Major earthquakes are much\nless frequent.  They can cause immense\ndamage to buildings, bridges, dams and\npeople.  There can be a great loss to life\nand property.  Earthquakes can cause\nfloods, landslides and tsunamis.  A\nmajor tsunami occurred in the Indian\nOcean on 26 December 2004.  All the\ncoastal areas around the ocean suffered\nhuge losses.\nActivity 12.6\nTake an outline map of the world.\nLocate the eastern coast and\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands in\nIndia.  Mark other countries around\nthe Indian Ocean which could have\nsuffered damage.  Collect accounts\nof the devastation caused by the\ntsunami in India from your parents,\nor other elders in the family or in\nthe neighbourhood.\nWhat Causes an Earthquake?\nFig. 12.10 : Earth platesWhat could cause a\ndisturbance inside\nthe earth?\nFig. 12.9 : Structure of the earthNow we know that the tremors are\ncaused by the disturbance deep down\ninside the uppermost layer of the earth\ncalled the crust  (Fig. 12.9).\nIn ancient times, people did not know\nthe true cause of earthquakes.  Their\nideas were, therefore, expressed in\nmythical stories such as the one told by\nBoojho’s grandmother . Similar myths\nwere prevalent in other parts of\nthe world.The outermost layer of the earth is\nnot in one piece.  It is fragmented.  Each\nfragment is called a plate  (Fig. 12.10).\nThese plates are in continual motion.\nWhen they brush past one another ,\nArabian\nPlateEurasian\nPlate\nIndan\nPlate\ncrust\nmantle\nouter\ncore\ninner\ncore\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 159or a plate goes under another due to\ncollision (Fig. 12.11), they cause\ndisturbance in the earth’s crust.  It is\nthis disturbance that shows up as an\nearthquake on the sur face of the earth.carried out.  However , most earthquakes\nare caused by the movement of earth’s\nplates.\nSince earthquakes are caused by the\nmovement of plates, the boundaries of\nthe plates are the weak zones where\nearthquakes are mor e likely to occur .\nThe weak zones are also known as\nseismic  or fault zones .  In India, the\nareas most thr eatened ar e Kashmir ,\nWester n and Central Himalayas, the\nwhole of North-East, Rann of Kutch,\nRajasthan and the Indo–Gangetic Plane.\nSome areas of South India also fall in\nthe danger zone  (Fig. 12.12).\nIf scientists know so much\nabout earthquakes, can\nthey also predict when and\nwhere the next one will\nstrike?\nI read somewhere that\nunderground explosions\ncould also cause\ntremors.\nFig. 12.11 : Movements of earth’s plates\nFig. 12.12 : Movements of Indian earth’s plate\nThe power of an earthquake is\nexpressed in terms of a magnitude\non a scale called the Richter scale .\nReally destructive earthquakes have\nmagnitudes higher than 7 on the\nRichter scale.  Both Bhuj and Kashmir\nearthquakes had magnitudes greater\nthan 7.5.Although, we know for sure what\ncauses an earthquake, it is not yet\npossible to predict when and where the\nnext earthquake might occur .\nTremors on the earth can also be\ncaused when a volcano erupts, or a\nmeteor hits the earth, or an\nunderground nuclear explosion is\nColliding\nBrushing\npast\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 160The tremors produce waves on the surface of the earth. These are called\nseismic waves. The waves are recorded by an instrument called the\nseismograph (Fig. 12.13). The instrument is simply a vibrating rod, or a\npendulum, which starts vibrating when tr emors occur . A pen is attached to\nthe vibrating system. The pen records the seismic waves on a paper which\nmoves under it. By studying these waves, scientists can construct a complete\nmap of the earthquake, as shown in  Fig. 12.14. They can also estimate its\npower to cause destruction.\nFig. 12.13 : A seismographA typical seismograph record\nFig. 12.14 : Map of the earthquake\nEpicentreSeismic\nwavesFocus\nInside the earthEarth’s\nSurface\nLike many other scales in science (decibel is another example), Richter scale\nis not linear .  This means that an earthquake of magnitude 6 does not have\none and half times the destructive energy of an earthquake of magnitude 4.\nIn fact, an increase of 2 in magnitude means 1000 times more destructive\nenergy. Therefore, an earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more\ndestructive energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4.\nProtection against Earthquakes\nWe know fr om the earlier pages that\nearthquakes cannot be pr edicted.  W e\nhave also seen that they can be highly\ndestructive.  It is, therefore, important\nthat we take necessary precautions to\nprotect ourselves all the time.  Peopleliving in seismic zones, where the\nearthquakes are mor e likely to occur ,\nhave to be specially prepared.  First of\nall, the buildings in these zones should\nbe so designed that they can withstand\nmajor tremors. Modern building\ntechnology can make it possible.\nString\nPenPendulum Bob\nRotating\nDrum\nChart\nPaperSupport\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 161It is advisable to make the structure\nsimple so that it is ‘Quake Safe’.\nlConsult qualified architects and\nstructural engineers.\nlIn highly seismic areas, the use of\nmud or timber is better than using\nheavy construction material. Keep\nroofs as light as possible.  In case\nthe structure falls, the damage will\nnot be heavy.\nlIt is better if the cupboards and\nshelves are fixed to the walls, so that\nthey do not fall easily.\nlBe careful where you hang wall\nclocks, photo-frames, water heaters\netc., so that in the event of an\nearthquake, they do not fall on\npeople.\nlSince some buildings may catch fire\ndue to an earthquake, it is necessary\nthat all buildings, especially tall\nbuildings, have fire fighting\nequipment in working or der.The Central Building Research\nInstitute, Roorkee, has developed\nknowhow to make quake-resistant\nhouses.\nIn the event that an earthquake does\nstrike, take the following steps to protect\nyourself.\n1. If you are at home\nlTake shelter under a table and stay\nthere till the shaking stops.\nlStay away from tall and heavy objects\nthat may fall on you.\nlIf you are in bed, do not get up.\nProtect your head with a pillow.\n2.

{"class": "8", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 13: light", "content": "LIGHTLIGHT\nThe world is largely known through\nthe senses. The sense of sight\nis one of the most important\nsenses. Through it we see mountains,\nrivers, trees, plants, chairs, people and\nso many other things ar ound us. W e also\nsee clouds, rainbows and birds flying\nin the sky. At night we see the moon\nand the stars. Y ou are able to see the\nwords and sentences printed on this\npage. How is seeing made possible?\n13.1 What makes Things\nVisible\nHave you ever thought how we see\nvarious objects? Y ou may say that  eyes\nsee the objects. But, can you see an\nobject in the dark? It means that eyes\nalone cannot see any object. It is only\nwhen light from an object enters our\neyes that we see the object. The light\nmay have been emitted by the object, or\nmay have been reflected by it.\nYou lear nt in Class VII that a polished\nor a shiny sur face can act as a mirr or. A\nmirror changes the direction  of light\nthat falls on it. Can you tell in which\ndirection the light falling on a sur face\nwill be reflected? Let us find out.\n13.2 Laws of Reflection\nActivity 13.1\nFix a white sheet of paper on a\ndrawing board or a table. Take acomb and close all its openings\nexcept one in the middle. Y ou can\nuse a strip of black paper for\nthis purpose. Hold the comb\nperpendicular to the sheet of paper .\nThrow light from a torch through\nthe opening of the comb from one\nside (Fig. 13.1). With slight\nadjustment of the torch and the\ncomb you will see a ray of light along\nthe paper on the other side of the\ncomb. Keep the comb and the torch\nsteady. Place a strip of plane mirror\nin the path of the light ray\n(Fig. 13.1). What do you observe?\nAfter striking the mirr or, the ray of\nlight is reflected in another direction.\nThe light ray, which strikes any sur face,\nis called the incident ray . The ray that\ncomes back fr om the sur face after\nreflection is known as the reflected ray .Fig. 13.1 : Arrangement for showing reflection\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 166\nA ray of light is an idealisation. In\nreality, we have a narrow beam of\nlight which is made up of several\nrays. For simplicity, we use the term\nray for a narrow beam of light.\nDraw lines showing the position of\nthe plane mirr or, the incident ray and\nthe reflected ray on the paper with the\nhelp of your friends. Remove the mirror\nand the comb. Draw a line making an\nangle of 90º to the line representing the\nmirror at the point where the incident\nray strikes the mirr or.

You, too, can use the\nSun as the source of light.\nThese activities can also be performed\nby making use of the Ray Streak\nApparatus (available in the kit\nprepared by NCER T).\nBoojho remembered that in Class VII,\nhe had studied some features of the\nimage of an object formed by a plane\nmirror . Paheli asked him to r ecall\nthose features:\n(i)Was the image er ect or upside\ndown?\n(ii)Was it of the same size as the\nobject?\n(iii)Did the image appear at  the same\ndistance behind the mirror as the\nobject was in front of it?\n(iv)Could it be obtained on a screen?\nLet us understand a little more about\nthe formation of an image by a plane\nmirror in the following way:\nActivity 13.3\nA source of light O is placed in front\nof a plane mirror PQ. Two rays OA\nand OC are incident on it (Fig. 13.5).\nCan you find out the direction of\nthe reflected rays?\nDraw nor mals to the sur face of\nthe mirror PQ, at the points A and\nC. Then draw the reflected rays at\nthe points A and C. How would you\ndraw these rays? Call the reflected\nrays AB and CD, respectively.\nExtend them further . Do they meet?\nExtend them backwards. Do they\nmeet now? If they meet, mark this\npoint as I. For a viewer’s eye at E\n(Fig. 13 .5), do the reflected rays(b)\nFig. 13.4 (a), (b) : Incident ray, reflected ray\nand the normal at the point\nof incidence lie in the same\nplane\nWhen the whole sheet of paper is\nspread on the table, it represents one\nplane. The incident ray, the normal at\nthe point of incidence and the reflected\nray are all in this plane. When you bend\nthe paper you create a plane different\nfrom the plane in which the incident\nray and the normal lie. Then you do not\nsee the reflected ray. What does it\nindicate? It indicates that the incident\nray, the normal at the point of\nincidence and the reflected ray all lie\nin the same plane. This is another law\nof reflection.\nPaheli and Booj ho per formed the\nabove activities outside the classroom\n(a)\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 168appear to come from the point I.\nSince the reflected rays do not\nactually meet at I, but only appear\nto do so, we say that a virtual image\nof the point O is formed at I. As you\nhave learnt already in Class VII,\nsuch an image cannot be obtained\non a screen.\nYou may recall that in an image\nformed by a  mirror the left of the object\nappears on the right and the right\nappears on the left. This is known as\nlateral inversion .\n13.3 Regular and Diffused\nReflection\nActivity 13.4\nImagine that parallel rays are\nincident on an irr egular sur face as\nshown in Fig. 13.6. Remember that\nthe laws of reflection are valid at\neach point of the sur face. Use these\nlaws to construct reflected rays at\nvarious points. Are they parallel to\none another? Y ou will find that\nthese rays are reflected in different\ndirections. (Fig. 13.7)When all the parallel rays reflected\nfrom a r ough or irr egular sur face ar e\nnot parallel, the reflection is known as\ndiffused  or irregular  reflection.\nRemember that the diffused reflection\nis not due to the failure of the laws of\nreflection. It is caused by the\nirregularities in the reflecting sur face,\nlike that of a cardboard.\nOn the other hand , reflection from\na smooth sur face like that of a\nmirror is called regular reflection\n(Fig. 1 3.8). Images are formed by\nregular reflection.Fig. 13.5 : Image formation in a plane mirrorFig. 13.6 : Parallel rays incident on\nan irregular surface\nFig. 13.7 : Rays reflected from irregular\nsurface\nFig. 13.8 : Regular reflection\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 169Let us find out.\n13.4 Reflected Light Can be\nReflected Again\nRecall the last time you visited a hair\ndresser .

The periscope makes use of\ntwo plane mirrors. Can you explain\nhow reflection from the two mirrors\nenables you to see objects which are\nnot visible directly? Periscopes are\nused in submarines, tanks and also\nby soldiers in bunkers to see things\noutside.\n13.5 Multiple Images\nYou ar e awar e that a plane mirr or for ms\nonly a single image of an object. What\nhappens if two plane mirrors are used\nin combination? Let us see.Do W e See all Objects due to Reflected Light?\nNearly everything you see around is seen due to reflected light. Moon, for example,\nreceives light from the Sun and reflects it. That’s how we see the moon. The objects\nwhich shine in the light of other objects are called illuminated  objects . Can you\nname some other such objects?\nThere are other objects, which give their own light, such as the Sun, fire, flame\nof a candle and an electric lamp. Their  light falls on our eyes. That is how we see\nthem. The objects which emit their own light are known as luminous objects.\nFig. 13.9 : Mirror at the hair dresser shop\nI have a question. Can the\nreflected rays be further reflected\nif incident on another mirror?\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 170Activity 13.5\nTake two plane mirrors. Set them\nat right angles to each other with\ntheir edges touching (Fig. 13.10). To\nhinge them you can use adhesive\ntape. Place a coin in between the\nmirrors. How many images of the\ncoin do you see (Fig. 13.10)?\nNow hinge the mirrors using the\nadhesive tape at different angles, say\n45°, 60°, 120°, 180° etc. Place some\nobject (say a candle) in between\nthem. Note down the number of\nimages of the object in each case.\nFinally, set the two mirrors\nparallel to each other . Find out\nhow many images of a candle\nplaced between them are formed\n(Fig. 13.11).Fig. 13.10 : Images in plane mirror at right\nangle to each other\nFig. 13.11 : Image in plane mirror parallel\nto each other\nmirrors\n(a)\n(b) (c)Can you now explain how you can\nsee the back of your head at the hair\ndresser’s shop?\nThis idea of number of images formed\nby mirrors placed at an angle to one\nanother is used in a kaleidoscope to\nmake numer ous beautiful patter ns. You\ncan also make a kaleidoscope yourself.\nKaleidoscope\nActivity 13.6\nTo make a kaleidoscope, get three\nrectangular mirror strips each about\n15 cm long and 4 cm wide. Join\nthem together to form a prism as\nshown in Fig. 13.12(a). Fix this\narrangement of mirrors in a circular\ncardboard tube or tube of a thick\nchart paper . Make sur e that the tube\nis slightly longer than the mirror\nstrips. Close one end of the tube by\na cardboard disc having a hole in\nthe centre, through which you can\nsee [Fig. 13.12(b)]. To make the disc\ndurable, paste a piece of transparent\nplastic sheet under the cardboard\nFig. 13.12 : Making a kaleidoscope\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 171disc. At the other end, touching the\nmirrors, fix a circular plane glass\nplate [Fig. 13.12(c)]. Place on this\nglass plate several small pieces of\ncoloured glass (broken pieces of\ncoloured bangles). Close this end of\nthe tube by a ground glass plate.\nAllow enough space for the colour\npieces to move around.\nYour kaleidoscope is r eady. When\nyou peep through the hole, you will be\nable to see a variety of patterns in the\ntube. An interesting feature of a\nkaleidoscope is that you will never see\nthe same pattern again. Designers of\nwallpapers and fabrics and artists often\nuse kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new\npatterns. To make your toy attractive,\nyou can wrap the kaleidoscope in a\ncolour ed paper .13.6 Sunlight — White or\nColoured\nIn Class VII, you learnt that the sunlight\nis referred to as white light. Y ou also\nlearnt that it consists of seven colours.\nHere is another activity (Activity 13.7)\nshowing that sunlight consists of several\ncolours.\n13.7 What is inside Our Eyes?\nWe see things only when light coming\nfrom them enters our eyes. Eye is one\nof our most important sense organs. It\nis, therefore, important to understand\nits structure and working.\nThe eye has a roughly spherical\nshape. The outer coat of the eye is\nwhite. It is tough so that it can protect\nthe interior of the eye from accidents.\nIts transparent front part is called\nActivity 13.7\nFig. 13.13 : Dispersion of lightGet a plane mirror of a suitable size.\nPlace it in a bowl ( katori) as shown\nin Fig. 1 3.13. Fill the bowl with\nwater . Put this arrangement near a\nwindow in such a way that direct\nsunlight falls on the mirr or. Adjust\nthe position of the\nbowl so that the\nreflected light from\nthe mirror falls on\na wall. If the wall is\nnot white, fix a sheet\nof white paper on it.\nReflected light will\nbe seen to have\nmany colours. How\ncan you explain\nthis? The mirror\nand water form aprism. As you learnt in Class VII ,\nthis breaks up the light into its\ncolours,  Splitting of light into its\ncolours is known as dispersion  of\nlight.  Rainbow is a natural\nphenomenon showing dispersion.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 172Fig. 13.15 : Demonstration of blind spotCaution : For this activity, never use\na laser torch.\nActivity 13.8\nLook into your friend’s eye. Observe\nthe size of the pupil. Throw light on\nher eye with a torch. Observe the\npupil now. Switch off the torch, and\nobserve her pupil once again. Do\nyou notice any change in the size\nof the pupil? In which case was the\npupil larger? Why do you think it\nwas so?\nIn which case do you need to\nallow more light in the eye, when\nthe light is dim or bright?\nBehind the pupil of the eye is a lens\nwhich is thicker in the centre. What\nkind of lens is thicker at the centre?\nRecall what you learnt about lenses incornea  (Fig. 13.14).  Behind the cornea,\nwe find a dark muscular structure\ncalled iris. In the iris, there is a small\nopening called the pupil. The size of\nthe pupil is controlled by the iris. The\niris is that part of eye which gives it its\ndistinctive colour . When we say that a\nperson has green eyes, we refer actually\nto the colour of the iris. The iris controls\nthe amount of light entering into the\neye. Let us see how.\nIris\nLens\nCiliary\nmuscle\nCornea\nRetinaOptic\nNerve\nFig. 13.14 : Human eyeClass VII. The lens focuses light on the\nback of the eye, on a layer  called retina\n(Fig. 13.14). The retina contains several\nnerve cells. Sensations felt by the nerve\ncells are then transmitted to the brain\nthrough the optic nerve. There are two\nkinds of cells–\n(i)cones, which are sensitive to bright\nlight and\n(ii)rods, which are sensitive to dim light.\nCones sense colour . At the junction\nof the optic nerve and the retina, there\nare no sensory cells, so no vision is\npossible at that spot. This is called the\nblind spot . Its existence can be\ndemonstrated as follows:\nActivity 13.9\nMake a round mark and a cross on\na sheet of paper with the spot to the\nright of the cross (Fig. 13.15). The\ndistance between two marks may be\n6-8 cm. Hold the sheet of paper at\nan arm’s length from the eye. Close\nyour left eye. Look continuously at\nthe cross. Move the sheet slowly\ntowards you, keeping your eye on\nthe cross. What do you find? Does\nthe round mark disappear at some\npoint? Now close your right eye.\nLook at the round mark now and\nrepeat the activity. Does the cross\ndisappear? The disappearance of the\ncross or the round mark shows that\nthere is a point on the retina which\ncannot send messages to the brain\nwhen light falls on it.\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 173Nature has provided eyes with\neyelids to prevent any object from\nentering the eye. Eyelids also shut out\nlight when not required.\nEye is such a wonder ful instrument\nthat it (normal) can clearly\n see distant\nobjects as well as objects nearby . The\nminimum distance at which the eye can\nsee objects distinctly varies with age. The\nmost comfortable distance at which one\ncan read with a normal eye is about\n25 cm.\nSome persons can see objects close\nto them clearly but cannot see distant\nobjects so clearly. On the other hand,\nsome persons cannot see objects nearby\nclearly but they can see distant objects\nquite well. With suitable corrective\nlenses, these defects of the eye can\nbe corrected.\nSometimes, particularly in old age,\neyesight becomes foggy. It is due to the\neye lens becoming cloudy. When it\nhappens, persons are said to have\ncataract. There is a loss of vision,\nsometimes extremely severe. It is\npossible to treat this defect. The opaque\nlens is removed and a new artificial\nlens is inserted. Modern technology\nhas made this procedure simpler\nand safer .\n13.8 Care of the Eyes\nIt is necessary that you take proper care\nof your eyes. If there is any problem\nyou should go to an eye specialist. Have\na regular checkup—\nlIf advised, use suitable spectacles.\nlToo little or too much light is bad\nfor eyes. Insufficient light causes\neyestrain and headaches. Too much\nlight, like that of the Sun, a power fulThe movies that we see are actually\na number of separate pictures in\nproper sequence. They are made to\nmove across the eye usually at the rate\nof 24 pictures  per second (faster\nthan 16 per second). So, we see a\nmoving picture.\nFront side of\ncardboardReverse side\nof cardboardThe impression of an image does not\nvanish immediately from the retina. It\npersists there for about 1/16th of a\nsecond. So, if still images of a moving\nobject are flashed on the eye at a rate\nfaster than 16 per second, then the eye\nperceives this object as moving.\nActivity 13.10\nGet a square piece of cardboard of\nsize 6-8 cm. Make two holes as\nshown in Fig. 13.16. Thread a\nstring through the two holes. Draw/\npaste a cage on one side of the\ncardboard and a bird on the other\nside.

Do not read by bringing\nthe book too close to your eyes or\nkeeping it too far .\nYou lear nt about balanced diet in\nClass VI. If food is deficient in some\ncomponents, eyes may also suf fer. Lack\nof vitamin A in foodstuff is responsible\nfor many eye troubles.  Most common\namongst them is night blindness.\nOne should, therefore, include in the\ndiet components which have vitamin A.\nRaw carrots, broccoli and greenDid you know?\nAnimals have eyes shaped in different ways. Eyes of a crab are quite small but\nthey enable the crab to look all around. So, the crab can sense even if the enemy\napproaches from behind. Butterflies have large eyes that seem to be made up\nof thousands of little eyes\n(Fig. 13.17). They can see not only\nin the front and the sides but the\nback as well.\nA night bird (owl) can see very\nwell in the night but not during\nthe day. On the other hand, day\nlight birds (kite, eagle) can see\nwell during the day but not in the\nnight. The owl has a large cornea\nand a large pupil to allow more\nlight in its eye. Also, it has on its\nretina a large number of rods and\nonly a few cones. The day birds\non the other hand, have more\ncones and fewer rods.Fig. 13.17 : Eyes of a butterfly\nEyes\nvegetables (such as spinach) and cod\nliver oil are rich in vitamin A. Eggs,\nmilk, curd, cheese, butter and fruits\nsuch as papaya and mango are also rich\nin vitamin A.\n13.9 Visually Impaired\nPersons Can Read and\nWrite\nSome persons, including children, can\nbe visually impaired. They have very\nlimited vision to see things. Some\npersons cannot see at all since birth.\nSome persons may lose their eyesight\nbecause of a disease or an injury. Such\npersons try to identify things by\ntouching and listening to voices more\ncarefully. They develop their other\nsenses mor e sharply. However ,\nadditional resources can enable them\nto develop their capabilities further .\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 17513.10 What is the Braille\nSystem?\nThe most popular resource for visually\nchallenged persons is Braille .\nLouis Braille\nLouis Braille, himself a visually\nchallenged person, developed a\nsystem for visually challenged persons\nand published it in 1821.Non-optical and optical aids for visually impaired\nNon-optical aids include visual aids, tactual aids (using the sense of touch), auditory\naids (using the sense of hearing) and electronic aids. Visual aids, can magnify\nwords, can provide suitable intensity of light and material at proper distances.\nTactual aids, including Braille writer slate and stylus, help the visually challenged\npersons in taking notes, reading and writing. Auditory aids include cassettes, tape\nrecorders, talking books and other such devices. Electronic aids, such as talking\ncalculators  and computers , are also available for performing many computational\ntasks. Closed circuit television, also an electronic aid, enlarges printed material\nwith suitable contrast and illumination. Nowadays, use of audio CDs and voice boxes\nwith computers are also very helpful for listening to and writing the desired text.\nOptical aids include bifocal lenses, contact lenses, tinted lenses, magnifiers\nand telescopic aids. While the lens combinations are used to rectify visual\nlimitations, telescopic aids are available to view chalkboard and class\ndemonstrations.\nThe present system was adopted in\n1932. There is Braille code for common\nlanguages, mathematics and scientific\nnotation. Many Indian languages can\nbe read using the Braille system.Braille system has 63 dot patterns or\ncharacters. Each character\nrepresents a letter , a combination of\nletters, a common word or a\ngrammatical sign. Dots are arranged\nin cells of two vertical rows of three\ndots each.\nPatterns of dots to represent some\nEnglish letters and some common\nwords are shown below.\nThese patterns when embossed on\nBraille sheets help visually\nchallenged persons to recognise words\nby touching. To make them easier to\ntouch, the dots are raised slightly.Fig. 13.18 : Example of dot patterns used\nin Braille System\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 176\nSome visually impaired Indians have great achievements to their\ncredit. Diwakar , a child pr odigy has given amazing per formances\nas a singer .\nRavindra Jain, born completely visually impaired, obtained\nhis Sangeet Prabhakar degree from Allahabad. He had shown his\nexcellence as a lyricist, singer and music composer .\nLal Advani, himself visually impaired, established an\nAssociation for special education and rehabilitation of disabled\nin India. Besides this, he represented India on Braille problems\nin UNESCO.\nHelen A. Keller , an American author and lectur er, is per haps the most well-\nknown and inspiring visually challenged person. She lost her sight when she was\nonly 18 months old. But because of her resolve and courage she could complete\nher graduation from a university. She wrote a number of books including The\nStory of my Life  (1903).Helen A. KellerVisually impaired people learn the\nBraille system by beginning with\nletters,  then special characters and\nletter combinations. Methods depend\nupon recognition by touching. Eachcharacter has to be memorised. Braille\ntexts can be produced by hand or by\nmachine.

Their uncle is a far mer.\nOne day they saw some tools like khurpi ,\nsickle, shovel, plough, etc., in the field.\nIn order to provide food for a large\npopulation— regular production, proper\nmanagement and distribution is\nnecessary.\n1.1Agricultural Practices\nTill 10,000 B.C.E. people wer e\nnomadic. They were wandering in\ngroups from place to place in search\nof food and shelter . They ate raw\nfruits and vegetables and started\nhunting animals for food. Later , they\ncould cultivate land and produce rice,\nwheat and other food crops. Thus,\nwas born ‘Agriculture’.\nWhen plants of the same kind are\ncultivated at one place on a large scale,\nit is called a crop. For example, crop of\nwheat means that all the plants grown\nin a field are that of wheat.\nYou alr eady know that cr ops ar e of\ndifferent types like cereals, vegetables\nand fruits. These can be classified on the\nbasis of the season in which they grow.\nIndia is a vast country. The climatic\nconditions like temperature, humidity\nand rainfall vary from one region to\nanother . Accordingly, ther e is a richYou have lear nt that all living\norganisms require food. Plants can make\ntheir food themselves. Can you recall\nhow green plants synthesise their own\nfood? Animals including humans can\nnot make their own food. So, where do\nanimals get their food from?\nBut, first of all why do we have to eat\nfood?\nYou alr eady know that ener gy from\nthe food is utilised by organisms for\ncarrying out their various body\nfunctions, such as digestion, respiration\nand excr\netion.

Despite this diversity,\ntwo broad cropping patterns can be\nidentified. These are:\n(i) Kharif Crops : The crops which are\nsown in the rainy season are called\nkharif crops. The rainy season in India\nis generally fr om June to September .\nPaddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and\ncotton are kharif crops.\n(ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the\nwinter season (October to March) are\ncalled rabi crops. Examples of rabi\ncrops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard\nand linseed.\nBesides these, pulses and vegetables\nare grown during summer at many\nplaces.\n1.2Basic Practices of Crop\nProductionto as agricultural practices  which are\nlisted below:\n(i)Preparation of soil\n(ii)Sowing\n(iii)Adding manure and fertilisers\n(iv)Irrigation\n(v)Protecting from weeds\n(vi)Harvesting\n(vii)Storage\n1.3 Preparation of Soil\nThe preparation of soil is the first step\nbefore growing a crop. One of the most\nimportant tasks in agriculture is to turn\nthe soil and loosen it. This allows the\nroots to penetrate deep into the soil. The\nloose soil allows the roots to breathe\neasily even when they go deep into the\nsoil. Why does the loosening of soil allow\nthe roots to breathe easily?\nThe loosened soil helps in the growth\nof earthworms and microbes present in\nthe soil. These organisms are friends of\nthe farmer since they further turn and\nloosen the soil and add humus to it.\nBut why the soil needs to be turned and\nloosened?\nYou have lear nt  in the pr evious\nclasses that soil contains minerals,\nwater , air and some living organisms.\nIn addition, dead plants and animals\nget decomposed by soil organisms. In\nthis way, various nutrients in the dead\norganisms are released back into the\nsoil. These nutrients are again absorbed\nby plants.\nSince only a few centimetres of the\ntop layer of soil supports plant growth,\nturning and loosening of soil brings the\nnutrient-rich soil to the top so that\nplants can use these nutrients. Thus,Why  paddy can not be\ngrown in the winter season?\nPaddy requires a lot of\nwater . Ther efore, it is gr own\nonly in the rainy season.\nCultivation of crops involves several\nactivities undertaken by farmers over a\nperiod of time. Y ou may find that these\nactivities are similar to those carried out\nby a gardener or even by you when you\ngrow ornamental plants in your house.\nThese activities or tasks are referred\n2024-25\n\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 3turning and loosening of soil is very\nimportant for cultivation of crops.\nThe process of loosening and turning\nof the soil is called  tilling  or ploughing .\nThis is done by using a plough. Ploughs\nare made of wood or iron. If the soil is\nvery dry, it may need watering before\nploughing. The ploughed field may have\nbig clumps of soil called crumbs. It is\nnecessary to break these crumbs.\nLevelling the field is beneficial for\nsowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling\nof soil is done with the help of a leveller .\nSometimes, manure is added to the\nsoil before tilling. This helps in proper\nmixing of manure with soil. The soil is\nmoistened before sowing.\nAgricultural Implements\nBefore sowing the seeds, it is necessary to\nbreak soil clumps to get better yield. This\nis done with the help of various tools.\nThe main tools used for this purpose are\nthe plough, hoe and cultivator .Plough :  This is being used since\nancient times for tilling the soil, adding\nfertili sers to the crop, removing the weeds\nand turning the  soil. This is made of\nwood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or\nother animals  (horses and camels) . It\ncontains a strong triangular iron strip\ncalled ploughshare. The main part of the\nplough is a long log of wood which is\ncalled a ploughshaft. There is a handle\nat one end of the shaft. The other end is\nattached to a beam which is placed on\nthe bulls’ necks. One pair of bulls and a\nman can easily operate the plough\n[Fig. 1.1 (a)].\nThe indigenous wooden plough is\nincreasingly being replaced by iron\nploughs nowadays.\nHoe : It is a simple tool which is used\nfor removing weeds and for loosening\nthe soil. It has a long rod of wood or\niron. A strong, broad and bent plate of\niron is fixed to one of its ends and\nFig. 1.1 (a) :  The plough\nploughshaft\nploughsharebeam\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 4Activity 1.1\nTake a beaker and fill half of it\nwith water .

Damaged seeds\nbecome hollow  and ar e thus lighter .\nTherefore, they float o\nn water .\nThis is a good method for\nseparating good, healthy seeds from\nthe damaged ones.\nBefore sowing , one of the important\ntasks is to know about the tools used\nfor sowing seeds [Fig. 1.2 (a), (b)].\nTraditional tool : The tool used\ntraditionally for sowing seeds is\nshaped like a funnel [Fig. 1.2 (a)]. The\nseeds are filled into the funnel,\npassed down through two or three\npipes having sharp ends. These\nends pierce into the soil and place\nseeds there.Cultivator : Nowadays ploughing is\ndone by tractor -driven cultivator . The\nuse of cultivator saves labour and time.\n[Fig. 1.1 (c)].\nFig. 1.1 (b) : A hoe\nFig. 1.2 (a) :  Traditional method of sowing\nFig.  1.1 (c) :  Cultivator driven by a tractor\n1.4 Sowing\nSowing is an important part of crop\nproduction.

This sows the seeds\nuniformly at equal distance and depth.\nIt ensures that seeds get covered by the\nsoil after sowing. This protects seeds\nfrom being eaten by birds. Sowing by\nusing a seed drill saves time and labour .Fig. 1.2 (b) :  A seed drill\nThere is a nursery near my\nschool. I found that little\nplants were kept in small\nbags.

At times a few plants\nmay have to be removed to prevent\novercrowding.\n1.5Adding Manure  and\nFertilisers\nThe substances which are added to the\nsoil in the form of nutrients for the\nhealthy growth of plants are called\nmanure  and fertilisers .\nSoil supplies mineral nutrients to the\ncrop plants. These nutrients are\nessential for the growth of plants. In\ncertain areas, farmers grow crop after\ncrop in the same field. The field is never\nleft uncultivated or fallow. Imagine what\nhappens to the nutrients?\nContinuous cultivation of crops\nmakes the soil poor in nutrients.\nTherefore, farmers have to add manure\nto the fields to replenish the soil with\nnutrients. This process is called\nmanuring . Improper or insufficient\nmanuring results in weak plants.\nManure is an organic substance\nobtained from the decomposition of\nplant or animal wastes. Farmers dump\nplant and animal waste in pits at open\nplaces and allow it to decompose. The\ndecomposition is caused by some\nmicroorganisms. The decomposed\nmatter is used as organic manure.\nYou have alr eady lear nt about\nvermicomposting in Class VI.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 6Activity 1.2\nTake moong  or gram seeds and\ngerminate them.

Some\nexamples of fertilisers are — urea,\nammonium sulphate, super\nphosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen,\nPhosphorus, Potassium).\nThe use of fertilisers has helped\nfarmers to get  better yield of crops\nsuch as wheat, paddy and maize. But\nexcessive use of fertilisers has made\nthe soil less fertile. Fertilisers have  also\nbecome a source of water pollution.\nTherefore, in order to maintain  the\nfertility of the soil, we have to\nsubstitute fertilisers with organic\nmanure or leave the field uncultivated\n(fallow) in between two crops.\nThe use of manure improves soil\ntexture as well as its water retaining\ncapacity. It replenishes the soil with\nnutrients.\nAnother method of replenishing\nthe soil with nutrients is through crop\nrotation . This can be done by growing\ndifferent crops alter nately.  Earlier ,\nfarmers in northern India used to\ngrow legumes as fodder in one season\nand wheat in the next season. This\nhelped in the replenishment of the soil\nwith nitrogen. Farmers are being\nencouraged to adopt this practice.\nIn the previous classes, you have\nlearnt about Rhizobium  bacteria.\nThese are present in the nodules of\nroots of leguminous plants. They fix\natmospheric nitrogen.\nFig. 1.3 (a) : Preparation of the experiment\nDid  plants in all the glasses grow at\nthe same pace? Which glass showed\nFig. 1.3 (b) :Growing seedlings with manure\nand fertiliser\n2024-25\n\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 7\nTable 1.1 gives the  differences\nbetween a fertili ser and manure.\nAdvantages of Manure : The organic\nmanure is considered better than\nfertilisers. This is  because\n/circle6it enhances the water holding\ncapacity of the soil.\n/circle6it makes the soil porous due to which\nexchange of gases becomes easy.\n/circle6it increases the number of friendly\nmicrobes.\n/circle6it improves the texture of the soil.\n1.6 Irrigation\nAll living beings need water to live.\nWater is important for pr oper gr owth\nand development. W ater is absorbed by\nthe plant r oots. Along with water ,\nminerals and fertilisers are also\nabsorbed. Plants contain nearly 90%\nwater . Water is essential because\ngermination of seeds does not take place\nunder dry conditions. Nutrients\ndissolved in water are transported to\neach part of the plant. W ater alsoprotects the crop from both frost and\nhot air currents. To maintain the\nmoisture of the soil for healthy crop\ngrowth, fields have to be watered\nregularly.\nThe supply of water to crops at\nregular intervals is called irrigation . The\ntime and frequency of irrigation varies\nfrom crop to crop, soil to soil and season\nto season. In summer , the fr equency of\nwatering is higher . Why is it so? Could\nit be due to the increased rate of\nevaporation of water from the soil and\nthe leaves?Table 1.1 : Differences between Fertiliser and Manure\nS. No. Fertiliser Manure\n1.

Fertilisers are very rich in Manure is relatively less rich in plant\nplant nutrients like nitrogen, nutrients.\nphosphorus and potassium.\nSources of irrigation : The sources of\nwater for irrigation are— wells,\ntubewells, ponds, lakes, rivers, dams\nand  canals.I am very careful this\nyear about watering\nthe plants. Last\nsummer my plants\ndried up and died.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 8\nFig. 1.4 (a) :  Moat\nFig. 1.4 (b) :  Chain pump\nFig. 1.4 (d) :  RahatFig. 1.4 (c) : DhekliTraditional Methods of\nIrrigation\nThe water available in wells,\nlakes and canals is lifted up\nby different methods in\ndifferent regions, for taking it\nto the fields.\nCattle or human labour is\nused in these methods. So\nthese methods ar e cheaper ,\nbut less efficient. The various\ntraditional ways are:\n(i)moat (pulle y-system)\n(ii)chain pump\n(iii)dhekli, and\n(iv)rahat\n (Lever system)\n[Figs. 1.4 (a)- (d)].\nPumps are commonly\nused for lifting water . Diesel,\nbiogas, electricity and\nsolar energy is used to run\nthese pumps.\n2024-25\n\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 9Modern Methods of\nIrrigation\nModern methods of irrigation\nhelp us to use water\neconomically. The main\nmethods used are as follows:\n(i)Sprinkler System: This\nsystem is more useful on the\nuneven land where sufficient\nwater is not available. The\nperpendicular pipes, having\nrotating nozzles on top, are\njoined to the main pipeline\nat regular intervals. When\nwater is allowed to flow\nthrough the main pipe under pressure\nwith the help of a pump, it escapes from\nthe rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled\non the crop as if it is raining.\nSprinkler is very useful for lawns, coffee\nplantation and several other crops\n[Fig. 1.5 (a)].\nFig. 1.5 (b) :  Drip System\nFig. 1.5 (a) :  Sprinkler system\n(ii)Drip system : In this system, the\nwater falls drop by drop directly near\nthe roots. So it is called drip system. It\nis the best technique for watering fruit\nplants,  gardens and trees [Fig. 1.5(b)].\nWater is  not wasted at all. It is a boon in\nregions wher e availability of water is poor .\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 101.7 Pr otection fr om W eeds\nBoojho and Paheli went to a nearby\nwheat field and saw that there were some\nother plants in the field, growing along\nwith wheat plants.\nHave these other\nplants been planted\npurposely?\nIn a field many other undesirable\nplants may grow naturally along with\nthe crop. These undesirable plants are\ncalled weeds .\nThe removal of weeds is called\nweeding. W eeding is necessary since\nweeds compete with the crop plants for\nwater , nutrients, space and light. Thus,\nthey affect the growth of the crop. Some\nweeds inter fere even in harvesting and\nmay be poisonous for animals and\nhuman beings.\nFarmers adopt many ways to remove\nweeds and contr ol their growth. T illing\nbefore sowing of crops helps in\nuprooting and killing of weeds, which\nmay then dry up and get mixed with\nthe soil. The best time for the removal\nof weeds is before they produce flowers\nand seeds. The manual removal includes\nphysical removal of weeds by uprooting\nor cutting them close to the ground,\nfrom time to time. This is done with the\nhelp of a \nkhurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)]\nis also used to uproot weeds.\nWeeds ar e also controlled by using\ncertain chemicals, called weedicides ,\nlike 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the\nfields to kill the weeds. They do not\ndamage the crops. The weedicides are\ndiluted with water to the extent required\nand sprayed in the fields with a sprayer .\n(Fig. 1.6).\nDo weedicides have any\neffect on the person handling\nthe weedicide sprayer?Fig. 1.6 : Spraying weedicide\nAs already mentioned, the  weedicides\nare sprayed during the vegetative growth\nof weeds before flowering and seed\nformation. Spraying of weedicides may\naffect the health of  farmer s. So they\nshould use these chemicals very carefully.\nThey should cover their nose and mouth\nwith a piece of cloth during spraying of\nthese chemicals.\n1.8Harvesting\nHarvesting of a crop is an important\ntask. The cutting of crop after it is\nmature is called harvesting . In\nharvesting, crops are pulled out or cut\nclose to the ground. It usually takes 3\nto 4 months for a cereal crop to mature.\nHarvesting in our\ncountry is either done\nmanually by sickle\n(Fig. 1.7) or by a machine\ncalled harvester . In the\nharvested crop, the grain\nseeds need to be separatedFig. 1.7 :\nSickle\n2024-25\n\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 11from the chaff. This process is called\nthreshing . This is carried out with the\nhelp of a machine called ‘combine’ which\nis in fact a  harvester as well as a  thresher\n(Fig. 1.8).\nFig. 1.8 :  Combine\nAfter harvesting, sometimes\nstubs are left in the field, which\nare burnt by farmers. Paheli is\nworried. She knows that it\ncauses pollution. It may also\ncatch fire and damage the crops\nlying in the fields.\nHarvest Festivals\nAfter three or four months of hard\nwork there comes the day of the\nharvest. The sight of golden fields\nof standing crop, laden with grain,\nfills the hearts of farmers with joy\nand a sense of well -being. The\nefforts of the past season have\nborne fruit and it is time to relax\nand enjoy a little. The period of\nharvest is, thus, of great joy and\nhappiness in all parts of India.\nMen and women celebrate it with\ngreat enthusiasm. Special\nfestivals associated with the\nharvest season are Pongal,\nBaisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Nabanya\nand Bihu.\n1.9Storage\nStorage of produce is an important task.\nIf the harvested grains are to be kept\nfor longer time, they should be safe\nfrom moisture, insects, rats and\nmicroorganisms. Harvested grains have\nmore moisture. If freshly harvested\ngrains (seeds) are stored without drying,\nthey may get spoilt or attacked by\norganisms, making them unfit for use\nor for germination. Hence, before\nstoring them, the grains are properly\ndried in the sun to reduce the moisture\nin them. This prevents the attack by\ninsect pests, bacteria and fungi.Farmers with small holdings of land\ndo the separation of grain and chaff by\nwinnowing (Fig. 1.9).

However , large scale\nstorage of grains is done in silos  and\ngranaries  to protect them from pests\nlike rats and insects [Fig. 1.10 (a)\nand (b)].\nDried neem leaves are used for\nstoring food grains at home. For storing\nlarge quantities of grains in big\ngodowns, specific chemical treatments\nare required to protect them from pests\nand microorganisms.Activity 1.3\nMake the following Table in your\nnote book and complete it.\nS.No. Food Sources\n1.

However ,\nthere are other living organisms\naround us which we normally cannot\nsee. These are called microorganisms\nor microbes . For example, you might\nhave observed that during the rainy\nseason moist bread gets spoilt and its\nsurface gets cover ed with gr eyish white\npatches. Observe these patches through\na magnifying glass. Y ou will see tiny,\nblack rounded structures. Do you know\nwhat these structures are and where d o\nthese come from?\n2.1 Microorganisms\nActivity 2.1\nCollect some moist soil from the\nfield in a beaker and add water to\nit. After the soil particles have\nsettled  down , observe a drop of\nwater from the beaker under a\nmicroscope. What do you see ?\nActivity 2.2\nTake a few drops of water from a\npond. Spread on a glass slide and\nobserve through a microscope.\nDo you find tiny organisms moving\naround?These observations show that water\nand soil are full of tiny organisms,\nthough not all of them fall into the\ncategory of microbes. These\nmicroorganisms or microbes are so\nsmall in size that they cannot be seen\nwith the unaided eye. Some of these,\nsuch as the fungus that grows on bread,\ncan be seen with a magnifying glass.\nOthers cannot be seen without the help\nof a microscope. That is why these are\ncalled microorganisms or microbes.\nMicroorganisms are classified into\nfour major groups. These groups are\nbacteria , fungi ,  protozoa  and some\nalgae . Some of these common\nmicroorganisms are shown in\nFigs. 2.1 - 2.4.\nViruses are also microscopic but are\ndifferent from other microorganisms .\nThey, however , reproduce only inside the\ncells of the host organism, which may be\na bacterium, plant or animal. Some of the\nviruses are shown in Fig. 2.5. Common\nailments like cold, influenza (flu) and\nmost coughs are caused by viruses.\nSerious diseases like polio and chicken\npox are also caused by viruses.\nDiseases like dysentery and malaria\nare caused by protozoa(protozoans)\nwhereas  typhoid and tuberculosis (TB)\nare bacterial diseases.\nYou have lear nt about some of\nthese microorganisms in Classes VI\nand VII.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 18Fig. 2.4 :  Fungi\nFig. 2.1:  Bacteria\nChlamydomonas Spirogyra\nFig. 2.2 :  AlgaeAmoeba\nParamecium\nFig. 2.3 :  Protozoa\nBread mould PenicilliumAspergillus\n2024-25\n\nMICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 192.2Where do Microorganisms\nLive?\nMicroorganisms may be single-celled\nlike bacteria, some algae and protozoa,\nor multicellular , such as many algae and\nfungi. They live in all types of\nenvironment, ranging from ice cold\nclimate to hot springs; and deserts to\nmarshy lands. They are also found\ninside the bodies of animals including\nhumans. Some microorganisms\ngrow on other organisms while others\nexist freely.\n2.3 Microorganisms and Us\nMicroorganisms play an important role\nin our lives. Some of them are beneficial\nin many ways whereas some others are\nharmful and cause diseases. Let us\nstudy about them in detail.Microorganisms have been used for\nthe production of alcohol since ages.Friendly Microorganisms\nMicroorganisms are used for various\npurposes. They are used in the\npreparation of curd, bread and cake.\nCurd contains several micro-\norganisms. Of these, the bacterium ,\nLactobacillus   promotes the formation\nof curd. It multiplies in milk and\nconverts it into curd. Bacteria are also\ninvolved in the making of cheese,\npickles and many other food items. An\nimportant ingredient of rava (sooji)\nidlis and \nbhaturas  is curd. Can you\nguess why? Bacteria and yeast are also\nhelpful for fermentation of rice idlis\nand dosa batter .\nFig. 2.5 :  Viruses\nI saw that my mother\nadded a little curd to warm\nmilk to set curd for the\nnext day. I wonder why?They are also used in cleaning up\nof the environment. For example, the\norganic wastes (vegetable peels, remains\nof animals,  faeces , etc.) are broken\ndown into harmless and usable\nsubstances by bacteria. Recall that\nbacteria are also used in the\npreparation of medicines. In agriculture\nthey are used to increase soil fertility\nby fixing nitrogen.\nMaking of Curd and Bread\nYou have lear nt in Class VII that milk is\nturned into curd by bacteria.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 20spoon of yeast powder to the sugar\nsolution. Keep it covered in a warm\nplace for 4-5 hours. Now smell the\nsolution.  Can you get a smell?\nLouis Pasteur\ndiscovered\nfermentation\nin 1857.\nIn 1929, Alexander\nFleming was working\non a culture of disease-\ncausing bacteria.\nSuddenly he found the\nspores of a little green mould in one of\nhis culture plates. He observed that\nthe presence of mould prevented the\ngrowth of bacteria. In fact, it also killed\nmany of these bacteria. From this the\nmould penicillin was prepared.\nThis is the smell of alcohol as sugar\nhas been converted into alcohol by yeast.\nThis process of conversion of sugar into\nalcohol is known as fermentation.Activity 2.3\nTake ½ kg flour ( atta or maida ),\nadd some sugar and mix with\nwarm water . Add a small amount\nof yeast powder and knead to\nmake a soft dough. What do you\nobserve after two hours? Did you\nfind the dough rising?\nMaida with yeast powder\nRaised maida\nFig. 2.6\nYeast r eproduces rapidly and\nproduces carbon dioxide during\nrespiration. Bubbles of the gas fill the\ndough and increase its volume (Fig. 2.6).\nThis is the basis of the use of  yeast in\nthe baking industry for making breads,\npastries and cakes.\nCommercial Use of Microorganisms\nMicroorganisms are used for the large scale\nproduction of alcohol, wine and acetic acid\n(vinegar). Y east is used for commer cial\nproduction of alcohol and wine. For this\npurpose yeast is grown on natural sugars\npresent in grains like barley, wheat, rice,\ncrushed fruit juices , etc.\nActivity 2.4\nTake a 500 mL beaker filled upto\n¾ with water . Dissolve 2-3\nteaspoons of sugar in it. Add half a\nMedicinal Use of Microorganisms\nWhen ever you fall ill the doctor may\ngive you some antibiotic tablets,\ncapsules or injections such as of\npenicillin. The source of these\nmedicines is microorganisms. These\nmedicines kill or stop the growth of the\ndisease -causing microorganisms. Such\nmedicines are called antibiotics . These\ndays a number of antibiotics are being\nproduced from bacteria and fungi.\nStreptomycin, tetracycline and\nerythromycin are some of the\n2024-25\n\nMICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 21commonly known antibiotics which are\nmade from fungi and bacteria. The\nantibiotics are manufactured by\ngrowing specific microorganisms and\nare used to cure a variety of diseases.\nAntibiotics are even mixed with the\nfeed of livestock and poultry to check\nmicrobial infection in animals. They are\nalso used to control many plant\ndiseases.\nIt is important to remember that\nantibiotics should be taken only on\nthe advi ce of a qualified doctor . Also\nyou must complete  the course\nprescribed by the doctor . If you take\nantibiotics when not needed or in\nwrong doses, it may make the drug\nless effective when you might need\nit in future. Also antibiotics taken\nunnecessarily may kill the beneficial\nbacteria in the body. Antibiotics,\nhowever , are not ef fective against\ncold and flu as these are caused by\nviruses.\nVaccinefrom the disease-causing microbes for\never. This is how a vaccine works.\nSeveral diseases, including cholera,\ntuberculosis, smallpox and hepatitis can\nbe prevented by vaccination.\nEdward Jenner\ndiscovered the\nvaccine for small-\npox in 1798.\nWhy are children/infants\ngiven vaccination?\nWhen a disease-carrying microbe enters\nour body, the body produces antibodies\nto fight the invader . The body also\nremembers how to fight the microbe if\nit enters again. If dead or weakened\nmicrobes are introduced in to a healthy\nbody , the body fights and kills\nthe invading bacteria  by producing\nsuitable antibodies. The antibodies\nremain in the body and we are protected\nIn your childhood, you must have\nbeen given injections to protect\nyourself against several diseases.\nCan you prepare a list of these\ndiseases? Y ou may take help fr om\nyour parents.\nIt is essential to protect all children\nagainst these diseases. Necessary\nvaccines are available in the nearby\nhospitals. Y ou might have seen the\nadvertisement on TV and newspapers\nregarding protection of children against\npolio under the Pulse Polio Programme.\nPolio drops given to children are\nactually a vaccine.\nA worldwide campaign against\nsmallpox has finally led to its eradication\nfrom most parts of the world.\nThese days vaccines are made on a\nlarge scale from microorganisms  to\nprotect humans and other animals from\nseveral diseases.\nIncreasing Soil Fertility\nSome bacteria  (Fig. 2.7) are able to fix\nnitrogen from the atmosphere to enrich\nsoil with nitrogen and increase its\nfertility. These microbes are commonly\ncalled biological nitrogen fixers.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 22Cleaning the Environment\nBoojho and Paheli had observed the\nschool gardener making manure. Along\nwith their friends, they collected wastes\nof plants, vegetables and fruit s from\nnearby houses and  gardens. They put\nthem in a pit meant for waste disposal.\nAfter some time , it decomposed and got\nconverted to manure. Boojho and\nPaheli wanted to know how this had\nhappen ed.\nActivity 2.5\nTake two pots and fill each pot half\nwith soil. Mark them A and B. Put\nplant waste in pot A and things like\npolythene bags, empty glass bottles\nand broken plastic toys in pot B.\nPut the pots aside. Observe them\nafter 3-4 weeks.\nDo you find any difference in the\ncontents of the two pots? If so, what is\nthe dif ference? Y ou will find that plant\nwaste  in pot A, has been decomposed.\nHow did this happen? The plant waste\nhas been converted into manure by the\naction of microbes. The nutrientsreleased in the process can be used by\nthe plants again.\nDid you notice that in pot B , the\npolythene bags, empty glasses, bottles\nand broken toy parts did not undergo\nany such change? The microbes could\nnot ‘act’ on them and convert them into\nmanure.\nYou often see lar ge amounts of\ndead organic matter in the form of\ndecaying plants and sometimes dead\nanimals on the gr ound. Y\nou find\nthat they disappear after some time.\nThis is because the microorganisms\ndecompose dead organic waste of plants\nand animals converting them into\nsimple substances. These substances\nare again used by other plants and\nanimals.  Thus, microorganisms can\nbe used to degrade the harmful and\nsmelly substances and thereby clean\nup the environment.\n2.4Harmful Microorganisms\nMicroorganisms are harmful in many\nways. Some of the microorganisms\ncause diseases in human beings, plants\nand animals. Such disease-causingFig. 2.7 :  The Nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria (blue green algae)\n2024-25\n\nMICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 23\nmicroorganisms are called pathogens.\nSome microorganisms spoil food,\nclothing and leather . Let us study mor e\nabout their harmful activities.\nDisease causing Microorganisms\nin Humans\nPathogens enter our body through the\nair we breathe, the water we drink or\nthe food we eat. They can also get\ntransmitted by direct contact with an\ninfected person or carried by an animal.\nMicrobial diseases that can spread from\nan infected person to a healthy person\nthrough air , water , food or physical\ncontact are called communicable\ndiseases . Examples of such diseases\ninclude cholera, common cold, chicken\npox and tuberculosis.\nWhen a person suffering from\ncommon cold sneezes, fine droplets of\nmoisture carrying thousands of viruses\nare spread in the air . The virus may enter\nthe body of a healthy person while\nbreathing and cause infection.There are some insects and animals\nwhich act as carriers  of disease-\ncausing microbes. Housefly is one such\ncarrier . The flies sit on the garbage and\nanimal excreta. Pathogens stick to their\nbodies. When these flies sit on uncovered\nfood they may transfer the pathogens.\nWhoever eats the contaminated food is\nlikely to get sick. So, it is advisable to\nalways keep food covered. Avoid\nconsuming uncovered items of food.\nAnother example of a carrier is the\nfemale Anopheles  mosquito (Fig. 2.8),\nwhich carries the parasite of malaria\n(Plasmodium). Female Aedes  mosquito\nacts as carrier of dengue virus.\nHow can we control the spread of malaria\nor dengue?\nThen how do you\nprevent the spread of\ncommunicable\ndiseases?\n We should keep a\nhandkerchief on the\nnose and mouth while\nsneezing. It is better to\nkeep a distance from\ninfected persons.\nFig. 2.8 : Female Anopheles mosquito\nWhy does the teacher\nkeep telling us not\nto let water collect\nanywhere in the\nneighbourhood?\nAll mosquitoes br eed in water .

So, it\nis very important that we preserve\nfood to prevent it from being spoilt.\n2.5 Food Preservation\nIn Chapter 1, we have learnt about the\nmethods used to preserve and store food\ngrains.

Microorganisms\nthat grow on our food sometimes\nproduce toxic substances. These\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 26Let us study the common methods\nof pr eserving food in our homes. W e\nhave to save it from the attack of\nmicroorganisms.\nChemical Method\nSalts and edible oils are the common\nchemicals generally used to check the\ngrowth of microorganisms. Therefore\nthey ar e called preservatives . We add\nsalt or acid preservatives to pickles to\nprevent the attack of microbes. Sodium\nbenzoate and sodium metabisulphite are\ncommon preservatives. These are also\nused in jams and squashes to check\ntheir spoilage .\nPreservation by Common Salt\nCommon salt has been used to preserve\nmeat and fish for ages. Meat and fish\nare covered with dry salt to check\nthe growth of bacteria. Salting is also\nused to preserve amla\n, raw mangoes,\ntamarind, etc.\nPreservation by Sugar\nJams, jellies and squashes are preserved\nby sugar . Sugar r educes the moistur e\ncontent which inhibits the growth of\nbacteria which spoil food.\nPreservation by Oil and Vinegar\nUse of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage\nof pickles because bacteria cannot live\nin such an envir onment. V egetables,\nfruits, fish and meat are often preserved\nby this method.\nHeat and Cold Treatments\nYou must have observed your mother\nboiling milk before it is stored or used.\nBoiling kills many microorganisms.Similarly, we keep our food in the\nrefrigerator . Low temperatur e inhibits\nthe growth of microbes.\nPasteurised milk can be consumed\nwithout boiling as it is free from harmful\nmicrobes. The milk is heated to about\n700C for 15 to 30 seconds and then\nsuddenly chilled and stored. By doing\nso, it prevents the growth of microbes.\nThis process was discovered by Louis\nPasteur . It is called pasteurisation .\nStorage and Packing\nThese days dry fruits and even\nvegetables are sold in sealed air tight\npackets to prevent the attack of\nmicrobes.\n2.6Nitrogen Fixation\nYou have lear nt about the bacterium\nRhizobium   in Classes VI and VII. It is\ninvolved in the  fixation of nitrogen in\nleguminous plants (pulses). Recall that\nRhizobium  lives in the root nodules of\nleguminous plants  (Fig. 2.9), such as\nbeans and peas, with which it has a\nsymbiotic relationship. Sometimes\nnitrogen gets fixed through the action\nof lightning. But you know that the\namount of nitrogen in the atmosphere\nremains constant. Y ou may wonder\nhow? Let us understand this in the next\nsection.\nWhy does the milk that\ncomes in packets not spoil?\nMy mother told me that the\nmilk is ‘pasteurised’. What\nis pasteurisation?\n2024-25\n\nMICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 27nitrogen cannot be taken directly by\nplants and animals. Certain bacteria and\nblue green algae  present in the soil fix\nnitrogen from the atmosphere and\nconvert it into compounds of nitrogen.\nOnce nitrogen is converted into these\nusable compounds, it can be utilised by\nplants from the soil through their root\nsystem. Nitrogen is then used for the\nsynthesis of plant proteins and other\ncompounds. Animals feeding on plants\nget these proteins and other nitrogen\ncompounds (Fig. 2.10).\nWhen plants and animals die,\nbacteria and fungi present in the soil\nconvert the nitrogenous wastes into\nnitrogenous compounds to be used by\nplants again. Certain other bacteria\nconvert some part of them to nitrogen\ngas which goes back into the\natmosphere. As a result, the percentage\nof nitrogen in the atmosphere remains\nmore or less constant.\nFig. 2.10  : Nitrogen cycle\nFig. 2.9 : Roots of a leguminous plant with root\nnodules\n2.7 Nitrogen cycle\nOur atmosphere has 78% nitrogen gas.\nNitrogen is one of the essential\nconstituents of all living organisms as\npart of proteins, chlorophyll, nucleic\nacids and vitamins.

Y ou have alr eady\nstudied about water in Class VII. Is water\na limitless resource?\nIn the light of the availability of\nvarious resources in nature, natural\nresources can be broadly classified\ninto two kinds:\n(i) Inexhaustible Natural Resources:\nThese resources are present in unlimited\nquantity in nature and are not likely to\nbe exhausted by human activities.\nExamples ar e: sunlight, air .\n(ii) Exhaustible Natural Resources: The\namount of these resources in nature is\nlimited. They can be exhausted by\nhuman activities. Examples of these\nresources are forests, wildlife, minerals,\ncoal, petroleum, natural gas etc.\nActivity 3.2\n(It is a group activity)\nTake some containers.

Since all these are\nobtained from nature, they are called\nnatural resources.\n2024-25\n\nThese sub-groups represent the\nconsumers. As population is\ngrowing, second and third\ngenerations have larger number of\nconsumers.\nPut one full container for each\ngroup on a table. Ask consumers of\nthe first generation from each group\nto consume eatables from the\ncontainer of their group. Now, ask\nthe second generation consumers\nfrom each group to do the same. Ask\nstudents to observe carefully the\navailability of eatables in each\ncontainer . If some thing is left in the\ncontainers, ask third generation\nfrom each group to consume it. Now,\nfinally observe whether all the\nconsumers of the third generation\ngot the eatables or not. Also observe\nif anything is still left in any of the\ncontainers.\nAssume that the eatables in the\ncontainer represent the total\navailability of an exhausible natural\nresource like coal, petroleum or\nnatural gas. Each group may have a\ndifferent consumption pattern. Are\nthe earlier generations of any group\ntoo greedy?  It may be that the earlier\ngenerations in some groups were\nconcerned about the coming\ngeneration(s) and left something for\nthem.\nIn this chapter we will learn about\nsome exhaustible natural resources\nlike coal, petroleum and natural gas.\nThese were formed from the dead\nremains of living organisms (fossils).\nSo, these are all known as fossil\nfuels.3.1 Coal\nYou may have seen coal or hear d about\nit (Fig. 3.1). It is as hard as stone and is\nblack in colour .\nFig. 3.1: Coal\nCoal is one of the fuels used to cook\nfood. Earlier , it was used in railway\nengines to produce steam to run the\nengine. It is also used in thermal power\nplants to produce electricity. Coal is also\nused as a fuel in various industries.\nStory of Coal\nWhere do we get\ncoal from and how\nis it formed?\nAbout 300 million years ago the\nearth had dense forests in low lying\nwetland areas. Due to natural processes,\nlike flooding, these forests got buried\nunder the soil. As more soil deposited\nover them, they were compressed. The\ntemperature also rose as they sank\ndeeper and deeper . Under high pr essur e\nand high temperature, dead plants got\nslowly converted to coal. As coal\ncontains mainly carbon, the slow\nprocess of conversion of dead vegetation\ninto coal is called carbonisation.\n Since\nit was formed from the remains of\nvegetation, coal is also called a fossil fuel.\nA coal mine is shown in Fig. 3.2.\nCOAL AND PETROLEUM 33\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 34\nFig. 3.2:  A coal mine\nCoal Gas\nCoal gas is obtained during the\nprocessing of coal to get coke.

Now a\ndays, it is used as a source of heat\nrather than light.These days, bitumen, a petroleum\nproduct, is used in place of coal-tar\nfor metalling the roads.\nFig. 3.3:  Coal tarWhen heated in air , coal bur ns and\nproduces mainly carbon dioxide gas.\nCoal is processed in industry to get\nsome useful products such as coke, coal\ntar and coal gas.\nCoke\nIt is a tough, porous and black\nsubstance. It is an almost pure form of\ncarbon. Coke is used in the manufacture\nof steel and in the extraction of many\nmetals.\nCoal Tar\nIt is a black, thick liquid (Fig. 3.3) with\nan unpleasant smell. It is a mixture ofabout 200 substances. Products\nobtained from coal tar are used as\nstarting materials for manufacturing\nvarious substances used in everyday\nlife and in industry, like synthetic\ndyes, drugs, explosives, per fumes,\nplastics, paints, photographic materials,\nroofing materials, etc. Interestingly,\nnaphthalene balls used to repel moths\nand other insects are also obtained from\ncoal tar .\n2024-25\n\nCOAL AND PETROLEUM 35as a fuel in many industries situated\nnear the coal processing plants.\n3.2 Petroleum\nYou know that petr ol is used as a fuel in\nlight automobiles such as motor cycles/\nscooters and cars. Heavy motor vehicles\nlike trucks and tractors run on diesel.\nPetrol and diesel are obtained from a\nnatural resource called petroleum.  The\nword petroleum is derived from petra\n(rock) and oleum (oil) as it is mined\nfrom between the rocks under Earth as\nshown in Fig. 3.4.\nDo you know how petroleum is\nformed?\nPetroleum was formed from\norganisms living in the sea. As these\norganisms died, their bodies settled at\nthe bottom of the sea and got covered\nwith layers of sand and clay. Over\nmillions of years, absence of air , high\ntemperature and high pressureRefining of Petroleum\nPetroleum is a dark oily liquid. It has\nan unpleasant odour .

It is carried out in a petroleum\nrefinery (Fig. 3.5).Various constituents of petr oleum\nand their uses are given in Table 3.1.\nMany useful substances are obtained\nfrom petroleum and natural gas.\nThese are termed as ‘Petrochemicals’.\nThese are used in the manufacture\nof deter gents, fibr es (polyester , nylon,\nacrylic etc.), polythene and other\nman-made plastics. Hydrogen gas\nobtained from natural gas, is used in\nthe production of fertilisers (urea).\nDue to its great commercial\nimportance, petroleum is also called\n‘black gold’.\n3.3 Natural Gas\nNatural gas is a very important fossil\nfuel because it is easy to transport\nthrough pipes. Natural gas is stored\nunder high pressure as compressed\nnatural gas (CNG). CNG is used for\npower generation. It is now being used\nTable 3.1 V arious Constituents of Petr oleum and their Uses\nS.No. Constituents of Petroleum                       Uses\n1.

Such a network\nof pipelines exists in V adodara (Gujarat),\nsome parts of Delhi and other places.\nNatural gas is also used as a starting\nmaterial for the manufacture of a number\nof chemicals and fertilisers. India has vast\nreserves of natural gas. In our country,\nnatural gas has been found in T ripura,\nRajasthan, Maharashtra and in the\nKrishna Godavari delta.3.4Some Natural Resources\nare Limited\nYou have studied in the beginning of\nthe chapter that some natural resources\nare exhaustible like fossil fuels, forests,\nminerals etc.\nYou know that coal and petr oleum\nare fossil fuels. It required the dead\norganisms millions of years to get\nconverted into these fuels. On the\nother hand, the known reserves of\nthese will last only a few hundred\nyears. Mor eover , bur ning of these\nfuels is a major cause of air pollution.\nTheir use is also linked to global\nwarming. It is therefore necessary that\nwe use these fuels only when\nabsolutely necessary. This will result\nin better environment, smaller risk of\nglobal warming and their availability\nfor a longer period of time.\nIn India, the Petroleum Conservation\nResearch Association (PCRA) advises\npeople how to save petrol/diesel while\ndriving.

Sometimes, light is also given off\nduring combustion, either as a flame or\nas a glow.\nIn the reactions mentioned\nabove magnesium and charcoal are\ncombustible substances.\n2024-25\n\nActivity  4.2\n(Caution : Be careful while handling\nburning candle).\nFix a lighted candle on a table.

What\nhappens in the three cases? Does\nthe flame flicker off? Does it flicker\nand give  smoke? Does it burn\nunaffected? Can you infer anything\nat all about the role played by air in\nthe process of burning?\nWe find that for combustion, air is\nnecessary. The candle burns freely in\ncase (a) when air can enter the\nchimney from below. In case (b), when\nair does not enter the chimney from\nbelow, the flame flickers and produces\nsmoke. In case (c), the flame finally\ngoes off because the air is not\navailable.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 42Activity  4.3\nPlace a piece of burning wood or\ncharcoal on an iron plate or Tawa .\nCover it with a glass jar or a\ntumbler , or a transpar\nent plastic jar .\nObserve what happens. Does\ncharcoal stop burning after\nsometime?

Is it also some kind of\ncombustion?\nIn the sun, heat and light are\nproduced by nuclear r eactions. Y ou\nwill learn about this process in higher\nclasses.\nDuring extreme heat\nof summer , at some\nplaces dry grass\ncatches fire. From\nthe grass, it spreads\nto trees, and very\nsoon the whole forest\nis on fire (Fig. 4.4).

Can you guess why?\n2024-25\n\nCOMBUSTION  AND FLAME 43We find that a combustible substance\ncannot catch fire or burn as long as its\ntemperature is lower than its ignition\ntemperature. Have you ever seen\ncooking oil catching fire when a frying\npan is kept for long on a burning stove?\nKerosene oil and wood do not catch fire\non their own at room temperature. But,\nif kerosene oil is heated a little, it will\ncatch fire. But if wood is heated a little,\nit would still not catch fire. Does it mean\nthat ignition temperature of kerosene oil\nis lower than that of wood? Does it mean\nthat we need to take special care in\nstoring kerosene oil? The following\nactivity shows that it is essential for a\nsubstance to reach ignition temperature\nto burn.\nActivity 4.4\n(Caution : Be careful while handling\nburning candle).\nMake two paper cups by folding a\nsheet of paper . Pour about 50 mL of\nwater in one of the cups. Heat both\nthe cups separately with a candle\n(Fig. 4.5). What do you observe?The history of the matchstick is very\nold. More than five thousand years\nago small pieces of pinewood dipped\nin sulphur were used as matches in\nancient Egypt. The modern safety\nmatch was developed only about two\nhundred years ago.\nA mixture of antimony trisulphide,\npotassium chlorate and white\nphosphorus with some glue and\nstarch was applied on the head of a\nmatch made of suitable wood. When\nstruck against a rough surface, white\nphosphorus got ignited due to the heat\nof friction. This started the\ncombustion of the match. However ,\nwhite phosphorus proved to be\ndangerous both for the workers\ninvolved in the manufacturing of\nmatches and for the users.\nThese days the head of the safety\nmatch contains only antimony\ntrisulphide and potassium chlorate.\nThe rubbing surface has powdered\nglass and a little red phosphorus\n(which is much less dangerous).\nWhen the match is struck against\nthe rubbing surface, some red\nphosphorus gets converted into white\nphosphorus. This immediately reacts\nwith potassium chlorate in the\nmatchstick head to produce enough\nheat to ignite antimony trisulphide\nand start the combustion.Do these experiences tell you that\ndifferent substances catch fire at\ndifferent temperatures?\nThe lowest temperature at which a\nsubstance catches fire is called its\nignition temperature.\nCan you tell now why a matchstick\ndoes not catch fire on its own at room\ntemperature? Why does the matchstick\nstart burning on rubbing it on the side\nof the matchbox?\nFig. 4.5 :  Heating water in a paper cup\nwater\npaper\ncups\nWhat happens to the empty paper\ncup? What happens to the paper cup\nwith water? Does water in this cup\nbecome hot?\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 44If we continue heating\nthe cup, we can even boil\nwater in the paper cup.\nCan you think of an\nexplanation for this\nphenomenon?\nThe heat supplied to\nthe paper cup is\ntransferred to water by\nconduction. So, in the\npresence of water , the\nignition temperature of\npaper is not reached.\nHence, it does not burn.\nThe substances which\nhave very low ignition\ntemperature and can\neasily catch fire with\na flame are called\ninflammable substances . Examples of\ninflammable substances are petrol,\nalcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)\netc. Can you list some more inflammable\nsubstances?\n4.2How Do W e Contr ol Fir e?\nYou must have seen or hear d of fir e\nbreaking out in homes, shops and\nfactories. If you have seen such an\naccident, write a short description in\nyour note book. Also, share the\nexperience with your classmates.\nIt is important that all of us\nknow the telephone numbers\nof the fire service.Fig. 4.6: Firemen extinguish the fire by throwing water under pressure\nFind out the telephone number of the\nfire service in your area. If a fire\nbreaks out in your house or in your\nneighbourhood, the first thing to do\nis to call the fire service.Does your city/town have a fire\nbrigade station?\nWhen a fire brigade arrives, what\ndoes it do? It pours water on the fire\n(Fig. 4 .6). W ater cools the combustible\nmaterial so that its temperature is\nbrought below its ignition\ntemperature. This prevents the fire\nfrom spr eading. W ater vapour s also\nsurround the combustible material,\nhelping in cutting of f the supply of air .\nSo, the fire is extinguished.\nYou have lear\nnt that ther e are three\nessential requirements for producing\nfire. Can you list these requirements?\nThese are: fuel, air (to supply\noxygen) and heat (to raise the\ntemperature of the fuel beyond the\nignition temperature). Fire can be\ncontrolled by removing one or more of\nthese requirements. The job of a fire\nextinguisher is to cut off the supply of\nair, or to bring down the temperatur e\nof the fuel, or both. Notice that the fuel\n2024-25\n\nCOMBUSTION  AND FLAME 45The most common fire\nextinguisher is water . But\nwater works only when\nthings like wood and paper\nare on fire. If electrical\nequipment is on fire, water\nmay conduct electricity\nand harm those trying to\ndouse the fir e. W ater is\nalso not suitable for fires\ninvolving oil and petrol. Do\nyou recall that water is\nheavier than oil? So, it\nsinks below the oil, and oil\nkeeps burning on the top.\nFor fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like\npetrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher . CO2, being heavier than\noxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and\noxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in\nmost cases it does not harm the electrical equipment.\nHow do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure\nas a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When\nreleased fr om the cylinder , CO2 expands enor mously in volume and cools down.\nSo, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the\ntemperatur e of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fir e extinguisher . Another\nway to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium\nbicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these\nchemicals give off CO2.\nCAUTION  : Do not handle the gas\nstove yourself. Ask your parents\nto help.\nFig. 4.7 :  Fire extinguisher\nin most cases cannot be eliminated.\nIf, for instance, a building catches fire,\nthe whole building is the fuel.\n4.3Types of Combustion\nBring a burning matchstick or a gas\nlighter near a gas stove in the kitchen.\nTurn on the knob of the gas stove. What\ndo you observe?We find that the gas bur ns rapidly\nand produces heat and light. Such\ncombustion is known as rapid\ncombustion .\nThere are substances like\nphosphorus which burn in air at room\ntemperature.\nThe type of combustion in which\na material suddenly bursts into\nflames, without the application of any\napparent cause is called \nspontaneous\ncombustion.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 46\nSpontaneous combustion of coal dust\nhas resulted in many disastrous fires\nin coal mines. Spontaneous forest\nfires are sometimes due to the heat\nof the sun or due to lightning strike.\nHowever , most for est fir es ar e due to\nthe carelessness of human beings. It\nis important to remember that the\ncampfires must be completely\nextinguished before leaving a forest\nafter a picnic, or a visit.\nWe generally have fir eworks on\nfestival days. When a cracker is ignited,\na sudden reaction takes place with the\nevolution of heat, light and sound. A\nlarge amount of gas formed in the\nreaction is liberated. Such a reaction is\ncalled explosion.  Explosion can also take\nplace if pressure is applied on the\ncracker .\n4.4Flame\nObserve an LPG flame. Can you tell the\ncolour of the flame. What is the colour\nof a candle flame?\nRecall your experience of burning a\nmagnesium ribbon in Class VII. If you\ndo not have experience of burning the\nremaining items in Table 4.2 you can\ndo that now.\nTable 4.2  Materials forming Flame on Burning\nS.No. Material Forms flame Does not form flame\n1.

Bring a lighted\nmatchstick near the other end of the\nglass tube. Do you see a flame\ncaught at this end of the glass tube\nafter a while? If so, what is it that\nproduces a flame? Notice that the wax\nnear the heated wick melts quickly.\nThe substances which vapourise\nduring burning, give flames. For\nexample, kerosene oil and molten wax\nrise through the wick and are vapourised\nduring burning and form flames.\nCharcoal, on the other hand, does not\nvapourise and so does not produce a\nflame. In Activity 4.5, could the vapours\nof wax coming out of the glass tube be\nthe cause of the flame produced?\nFig. 4.10\nFig. 4.12When the candle flame is steady,\nintroduce a clean glass plate/slide into\nthe luminous zone of the flame\n(Fig. 4.11).

A good fuel is one which is\nreadily available. It is cheap. It burns\neasily in air at a moderate rate. It\nproduces a large amount of heat. It does\nnot leave behind any undersirable\nsubstances.\nThere is probably no fuel that could\nbe consider ed as an ideal fuel . We\nshould look for a fuel which fulfils most\nof the requirements for a particular use.\nFuels differ in their cost. Some fuels\nare cheaper than others.\nMake a list of fuels familiar to you.\nGroup them as solid, liquid and gaseous\nfuels as in Table 4.3.\n4.7Fuel Efficiency\nSuppose you were asked to boil a given\nquantity of water using cow dung, coal\nand LPG as fuel. Which fuel would you\nprefer? Give your r\neason. Y ou may take\nthe help of your parents. Do these three\nfuels produce the same amount of heat?\nThe amount of heat energy produced on\ncomplete combustion of 1 kg of a fuel is\ncalled its calorific value. The calorific\nvalue of a fuel is expressed in a unitFig. 4.13 : Different zones of candle flame\nTable 4.3 : Types of Fuels\n S. No. Solid Fuels Liquid Fuels Gaseous Fuels\n1.

These fine particles are\ndangerous pollutants causing\nrespiratory diseases, such as asthma.\n2.Incomplete combustion of these\nfuels gives carbon monoxide gas. It is a\nvery poisonous gas. It is dangerous to\nburn coal in a closed room. The carbon\nmonoxide gas produced can kill persons\nsleeping in that room.\nFor centuries, wood was used as\ndomestic and industrial fuel. But now\nit has been replaced by coal and other\nfuels like LPG. In many rural parts of\nour country, people still use wood as a\nfuel because of its easy availability and\nlow cost. However , burning of wood gives\na lot of smoke which is very harmful for\nhuman beings. It causes respiratory\nproblem. Also, trees provide us with\nuseful substances which are lost when\nwood is used as fuel. Moreover cutting\nof trees leads to deforestation  which is\nquite harmful to the environment, as\nyou learnt in Class VII.Table 4.4 : Calorific V alues of dif ferent\nFuels\nFuel Calorific V alue\n(kJ/kg)\nCow dung cake 6000-8000\nWood 17000-22000\nCoal 25000-33000\nPetrol 45000\nKerosene 45000\nDiesel 45000\nMethane 50000\nCNG 50000\nLPG 55000\nBiogas 35000-40000\nHydrogen 150000\nOh! So, that is why we are\nadvised never to sleep in a\nroom with burning or\nsmouldering coal fire in it.\nBurning of Fuels Leads to Harmful\nProducts\nThe increasing fuel consumption has\nharmful effects on the environment.\n1.Carbon fuels like wood, coal,\npetroleum release unburnt carbon3.Combustion of most fuels releases\ncarbon dioxide in the environment.\nIncreased concentration of carbon\ndioxide in the air is believed to cause\nglobal warming .\nGlobal warming is the rise in\ntemperature of the atmosphere  of the\nearth. This results , among other things,\nin the melting of polar glaciers , which\nleads to a rise in the sea level, causing\nfloods in the coastal areas . Low lying\ncoastal areas may even be permanently\nsubmer ged under water .\n4.Burning of coal and diesel releases\nsulphur dioxide gas. It is an extremely\nsuffocating and corr osive gas. Mor eover ,\npetrol engines give off  gaseous oxides\nof nitrogen. Oxides of sulphur and\nnitrogen dissolve in rain water and form\nacids. Such rain is called acid rain . It is\nvery harmful for crops, buildings\nand soil.\nThe use of diesel and petrol as fuels\nin automobiles is being replaced by\nCNG (Compressed Natural Gas), because\nCNG produces the harmful  products in\nvery small amounts.

This will lead\nto global warming as carbon dioxide\ntraps the heat rays reflected by the earth.\nThe increase in temperature on the earth\ndisturbs the water cycle and may reduce\nrainfall. This could cause droughts .\nDeforestation is a major cause which\nleads to the change in soil properties.\nPhysical properties of the soil get affected\nby plantation and vegetation. Fewer\ntrees result in more soil erosion.\nRemoval of the top layer of the soil\nexposes the lower , har d and r ocky\nlayers. This soil has less humus and is\nless fertile. Gradually the fertile land\ngets converted into deserts. It is called\ndesertification .\nDeforestation also leads to a decrease\nin the water holding capacity of the soil.\nThe movement of water from the soil\nsurface into the gr ound (infiltration rate)\nis reduced. So, there are floods. The\nother properties of the soil like nutrient\ncontent, texture etc., also change\nbecause of deforestation.\nWe have studied in Class VII that we\nget many products from forests.

Biological diversity or\nbiodiversity, refers  to the variety of\norganisms existing on the earth, their\ninterrelationships and their\nrelationship with the environment.\nProfessor  Ahmad organi ses a visit to\na biosphere reserve for Paheli, Boojho and\ntheir classmates. He selects a place\nnamed Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. He\nknows that the plants and animals found\nhere are similar to those of the upper\nHimalayan peaks and to those belonging\nto the lower western ghats. Professor\nAhmad believes that the biodiversity\nfound here is unique. He requests\nMadhavji, a forest employee, to guide the\nchildren inside the biosphere reserve.

As you\nare aware that biodiversity is the variety\nof plants, animals and microorganisms\ngenerally found in an area.  The\nbiosphere reserves  help to maintain the\nbiodiversity and culture of that area. A\nbiosphere reserve may also contain\nother protected areas in it. The\nPachmarhi Biosphere Reserve consists\nof one national park named Satpura and\ntwo wildlife sanctuaries named Bori and\nPachmarhi (Fig. 5.1).\nPACHMARHI SANCTUARY\nTO PIP ARIYATAW\nA\nRESERVIOR\nCHURNA\nBORI SANCTUARYDHAINBORISATPURA NA TIONAL PARKNEEMGHANPANARP ANI GA TE\nPACHMARHI↑N\nTable 5.1 : Protected Areas for Conservation\nProtected Areas — National Park Wildlife Sanctuary Biosphere Reserve\nIn my district\nIn my state\nIn my country\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 56\n(d)             (e) (f)\nFig.  5.2  : (a) W ild dog (b) Cheetal (c) Wolf (d) Leopar d (e) Fern (f) Jamun tr eeActivity  5.4\nList the factors disturbing the\nbiodiversity of your area. Some of\nthese factors and human activities\nmay disturb the biodiversity\nunknowingly. List these human\nactivities. How can these be checked?\nDiscuss in your class and write a\nbrief report in your notebook.\n5.5  Flora and Fauna\nAs the children walk around the\nbiosphere reserve they appreciate thegreen wealth of the forest. They are\nvery happy to see tall teak trees and\nanimals inside the forest. Suddenly,\nPaheli finds a rabbit and wants to\ncatch it. She starts running after it.\nProfessor Ahmad stops her . He\nexplains that animals are comfortable\nand happy in their own habitat. W e\nshould not disturb them. Madhavji\nexplains that some animals and plants\ntypically belong to a particular area.\nThe plants and animals found in a\nparticular area are termed flora  and\nfauna  respectively  of that area.\nSal, teak, mango, jamun , silver ferns, arjun,  etc., are the flora and chinkara , blue-\nbull, barking deer , cheetal , leopar d, wild dog, wolf, etc. ar e examples of the fauna\nof the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve (Fig. 5.2).\n(a) (b) (c)\n2024-25\n\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 57\nI have heard that some of the\nendemic species may vanish.\nIs it true?Activity 5.5\nTry to identify the flora and fauna\nof your area and list them.\n5.6Endemic Species\nSoon the group quietly enters the deep\nforest. Children are surprised to see a\nvery big squirrel. This squirrel has a big\nfluffy tail. They are very curious to know\nabout it. Madhavji tells them that this\nis known as the giant squirrel and is\nendemic to this area.\nEndemic species  are those species\nof plants and animals which are found\nexclusively in a particular area. They are\nnot naturally found  anywhere else. A\nparticular type of animal or plant may\nbe endemic to a zone, a state or a country.\nMadhavji shows sal  and wild mango\n(Fig. 5.3 (a)] as two examples of the\nFig. 5.3 (a) : Wild Mango\nFig. 5.3 (b) :  Giant squirrelendemic flora of the Pachmarhi\nBiosphere Reserve. Bison, Indian giant\nsquirrel [Fig. 5.3 (b)] and flying squirrel\nare endemic fauna of this area. Professor\nAhmad explains that the destruction of\ntheir habitat,  increasing population and\nintroduction of new species may affect\nthe natural habitat of endemic species\nand endanger their existence.\nSpecies  is a group of population\nwhich are capable of interbreeding.\nThis means that the members of a\nspecies can reproduce fertile offspring\nonly with the members of their own\nspecies and not with members of\nother species. Members of a species\nhave common characteristics.\nActivity 5.6\nFind out the endemic plants and\nanimals of the region where you live.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 585.7 Wildlife Sanctuary\nSoon Paheli sees a board with ‘Pachmarhi\nWildlife Sanctuary’ written on it.\nProfessor Ahmad explains that killing\n(poaching) or capturing animals in general\nis strictly prohibited and punishable\nby law in all such places. Wildlife\nSanctuaries  like reserve forests provide\nprotection and suitable living conditions\nto wild animals. He also tells them that\npeople living in wildlife sanctuaries are\nallowed to do certain activities such as\ngrazing by their livestock, collecting\nmedicinal plants, firewood, etc.instead of  their natural habitat? In\nyour opinion, will the animals be\ncomfortable in a zoo or in their\nnatural habitat?\n5.8  National Park\nOn the roadside there was another\nboard on which was written ‘Satpura\nNational Park’.\nChildren are now eager to go there.\nMadhavji tells them that these reserves\nare large and diverse enough to protect\nwhole sets of ecosystems. They preserve\nflora, fauna, landscape and historic\nobjects of an area. Satpura National\nPark is the first Reserve Forest of India.\nThe finest Indian teak is found in this\nforest.  There are more than one hundred\nNational Parks i n India.\n It is a pity that even protected forests\nare not safe because people living in the\nneighbourhood encroach upon them\nand destroy them.\nChildren are reminded of their visit\nto the zoo. They recall that zoos are also\nplaces where animals receive protection.Some of the threatened wild animals\nlike black buck, white eyed buck,\nelephant, golden cat, pink headed\nduck, gharial, marsh crocodile,\npython, rhinoceros, etc., are\nprotected and preserved in our wild\nlife sanctuaries. Indian sanctuaries\nhave unique landscapes—broad level\nforests, mountain forests and bush\nlands in deltas of big rivers.\nActivity 5.7\nVisit a nearby zoo. Observe the\nconditions provided to the animals.\nWere they suitable for the animals?\nCan animals live in artificial settingRock shelters are also found inside\nthe Satpura National Park. These are\nevidences of prehistoric human life\nin these jungles. These give us an\nidea of the life of primitive people.\nRock paintings are found in these\nshelters. A total of 55 rock shelters\nhave been identified in Pachmarhi\nBiosphere Reserve.\nFigures of animals and men\nfighting, hunting, dancing and\nplaying musical instruments are\ndepicted in these paintings. Many\ntribals still live in the area.\nAs children move ahead, they see a\nboar d with ‘Satpura T iger Reserve’\nwritten on it. Madhavji explains that\nProject Tiger  was launched by the\ngovernment to protect the tigers in the\ncountry. The objective of this project\nwas to ensure the survival and\nmaintenance of the tiger population in\nthe country.What is the difference between\na zoo and a wildlife sanctuary?\n2024-25\n\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 59Are tigers still found in this\nforest? I hope I can see a tiger!\nTiger (Fig. 5.4) is one of the many\nspecies which are slowly disappearing\nfrom our for ests. But, the Satpura T iger\nReserve is unique in the sense that a\nsignificant increase in the population of\ntigers has been seen here. Once upon a\ntime, animals like lions, elephants, wild\nanimals has become difficult because of\ndisturbances in their natural habitat.\nProfessor Ahmad tells them that in order\nto protect plants and animals strict rules\nare imposed in all National Parks.\nHuman activities such as grazing,\npoaching, hunting, capturing of animals\nFig. 5.4 :  Tiger\nbuffaloes (Fig. 5 .5) and barasingha\n(Fig. 5.6) were also found in the Satpura\nNational Park. Animals whose numbers\nare diminishing to a level that they might\nface extinction are known as the\nendangered animals . Boojho is\nreminded of the dinosaurs which became\nextinct a long time ago. Survival of some\nFig. 5.5 :  Wild buffaloFig. 5.6 :  Barasingha\nAre only big animals\nfacing extinction?\nMadhavji tells Paheli that small\nanimals are much more in danger of\nbecoming extinct than the bigger\nanimals. At times, we kill snakes, frogs,\nlizards, bats and owls ruthlessly without\nrealising their importance in the\necosystem. By killing them we are\nharming ourselves. They might be small\nin size but their role in the ecosystem\ncannot be ignored. They form part of\nfood chains and food webs.\nAn ecosystem  is made of all the\nplants, animals and microorganisms in\nan area along with non-living\ncomponents such as climate, soil,\nriver deltas etc.or collection of firewood,\nmdicinal plants, etc. are\nnot allowed\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 605.9Red Data Book\nProfessor  Ahmad explains about Red\nData Book to the children. He tells\nthem that Red Data Book  is the\nsource book which keeps a record of\nall the endangered animals and\nplants. Red  Data Book is maintained\ninternationally by an organisation .\nIndia also maintains Red Data Book\nfor plants and animal s found\nin India.\n5.10  Migration\nThe excursion party then enters deeper\ninto the forest under the guidance of\nMadhavji. They sit near the Tawa\nWhat would happen if we\nhad no wood? Is there\nany alternative\navailable to wood?\nI know that paper is one\nof the important products\nwe get from forests.\nI wonder whether\nthere are any alternatives\navailable for paper!Is there any permanent\nsolution to the problem\nof deforestation?Reservoir to relax for some time. Paheli\nobserves some of the birds near the\nriver. Madhavji tells the childr en that\nthese are migratory birds. These birds\nhave flown here from other parts of\nthe world.\nMigratory birds fly to far away areas\nevery year during a particular time\nbecause of climatic changes. They fly\nfor laying eggs as the weather in their\nnatural habitat becomes very cold and\ninhospitable. Birds who cover long\ndistances to reach another land are\nknown as migratory birds.\n5.11  Recycling of Paper\nProfessor  Ahmad draws attention of\nthe children to another cause of\ndeforestation. He tells them that it\ntakes 17 full grown trees to make one\ntonne of paper . Ther efore, we should\nsave paper . Professor  Ahmad also tells\nthat paper can be recycled five to seven\ntimes for use. If each student saves at\nleast one sheet of paper in a day, we\ncan save many tr ees in a year . We\nshould save, reuse used paper and\nrecycle it. By this we not only save\ntrees but also save  energy and water\nneeded for manufacturing paper .\nMoreover , the amount of har mful\nchemicals used in paper making will\nalso be reduced.I wonder if there is\nany record of all\nendangered species!\n2024-25\n\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 615.12  Reforestation\nProfessor Ahmad suggests that the\nanswer to deforestation is reforestation.\nReforestation is restocking of the\ndestroyed forests by planting new trees.\nThe planted trees should generally be\nof the same species which were found\nin that for est. W e should plant at least\nas many trees as we cut. Reforestation\ncan take place naturally also. If the\ndeforested area is left undisturbed, it re-\nestablishes itself. In natural reforestation\nthere is no r ole of human beings. W e\nhave already caused tremendous\ndamage to our forests. If we have toretain our green wealth for future\ngenerations, plantation of more trees is\nthe only option.\nProfessor Ahmad told them that in\nIndia we have the Forest (Conservation)\nAct. This act is aimed at preservation\nand conservation of natural forests and\nmeeting the basic needs of the people\nliving in or near the forests.\nAfter some rest Madhavji asks the\nchildren to start heading back because\nit is not advisable to stay in the\njungle after sunset. On getting back,\nProfessor Ahmad and the children\nthank Madhavji for guiding them\nthrough this exciting experience.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 62\n WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\nÜWildlife sanctuary, national park and bio-\nsphere reserve are names given to the areas\nmeant for conservation and preservation of\nforest and wild animals.\nÜBiodiversity refers to the variety of living\norganisms in a specific area.\nÜPlants and animals of a particular area are\nknown as the flora and  fauna of  that area.\nÜEndemic species are found only in a particular\narea.\nÜEndangered species are those which are facing\nthe danger of extinction.\nÜRed Data Book contains a record of\nendangered species.\nÜMigration is the phenomenon of movement of\na species from its own habitat to some other\nhabitat for a particular time period every year\nfor a specific purpose like breeding.\nÜWe should save, r euse and r ecycle paper to\nsave trees, ener gy and water .\nÜReforestation is the restocking of destroyed\nforests by planting new trees.\nExercises\n  1.Fill in the blanks.\n(a)A place where animals are protected in their natural habitat is\ncalled .\n(b)Species found only in a particular area is known as .\n(c)Migratory birds fly to far away places because of  changes.\n  2.Differentiate between the following.\n(a)Wildlife sanctuary and biosphere reserve\n(b)Zoo and wildlife sanctuary\n(c)Endangered and extinct species\n(d)Flora and fauna KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nBIODIVERSITY\nBIOSPHERE RESERVE\nDEFOREST ATION\nDESER TIFICA TION\nECOSYSTEM\nENDANGERED\nSPECIES\nENDEMIC SPECIES\nEXTINCT\nFAUNA\nFLORA\nMIGRA TORY BIRDS\nNATIONAL PARK\nRED DA TA BOOK\nREFOREST ATION\nSANCTUARY\n2024-25\n\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 63  3.Discuss the effects of deforestation on the following.\n(a)Wild animals\n(b)Environment\n(c)Villages (Rural areas)\n(d)Cities (Urban areas)\n(e)Earth\n(f)The next generation\n  4.What will happen if.\n(a)we go on cutting trees.\n(b)the habitat of an animal is disturbed.\n(c)the top layer of soil is exposed.\n  5.Answer in brief.\n(a)Why should we conserve biodiversity?\n(b)Protected forests are also not completely safe for wild animals.

{"class": "8", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 6: reproduction in animals", "content": "REPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS REPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS\nDo you recall the processes of\ndigestion, circulation and\nrespiration which you have\nstudied in your previous classes? These\nprocesses are essential for the survival\nof every individual. Y ou have also lear nt\nabout the process of reproduction in\nplants. Reproduction is essential for the\ncontinuation of a species. Imagine what\nwould have happened if organisms had\nnot r eproduced. Y ou will r ealise that\nreproduction is very important as it\nensures the continuation of similar\nkinds of individuals, generation after\ngeneration.\nYou have alr eady lear nt in your\nprevious class about reproduction in\nplants. In this chapter , we shall lear n\nhow reproduction takes place in\nanimals.\n6.1 Modes of Reproduction\nHave you seen the young ones\nof dif ferent animals? T ry to name some\nof the young ones by completing\nTable 6.1 shown in examples at S. No.\n1 and 5.\nYou must have seen the young\nones of various animals being born.\nCan you tell how chicks and\ncaterpillars are born? How are kittens\nand puppies born? Do you think that\nthese young ones looked the same\nbefore they were born as they do now?\nLet us find out.Just as in plants, there are two modes\nby which animals reproduce. These are:\n(i)Sexual reproduction, and\n(ii)Asexual reproduction.\n6.2 Sexual Reproduction\nTry to r ecall r eproduction in plants\nwhich you studied in Class VII. Y ou will\nremember that plants that reproduce\nsexually have male and female\nreproductive parts. Can you name these\nparts? In animals also, males and\nfemales have different reproductive parts\nor organs. Like plants, the reproductive\nparts in animals also produce gametes\nthat fuse to form a zygote. It is the zygote\nwhich develops into a new individual.\nThis type of reproduction beginning\nfrom the fusion of male and female\ngametes is called sexual reproduction .\nLet us find out the reproductive partsTable 6.1\nS. No. Animal Young one\n1. Human Baby\n2. Cat\n3. Dog\n4. Butterfly\n5. Hen Chick\n6. Cow\n7. Frog\n2024-25\n\nin humans and study the process of\nreproduction in them.\nMale Reproductive Organs\nThe male reproductive organs include a\npair of testes (singular , testis), two sper m\nducts and a penis (Fig. 6.1). The testes\nproduce the male gametes called\nsperms . Millions of sperms are produced\nby the testes. Look at Fig. 6.2 which\nshows the picture of a sperm. Though\nsperms are very small in size, each has\na head, a middle piece and a tail. Does\nit appear to be a single cell? Indeed, eachsperm is a single cell with all the usual\ncell components.\nFig. 6.1: Male reproductive\norgans in humansWhat purpose does the\ntail in a sperm serve?\nFig. 6.3 : Female reproductive organs in\nhumansFemale Reproductive Organs\nThe female reproductive organs are a pair\nof ovaries, oviducts (fallopian tubes) and\nthe uterus (Fig. 6.3). The ovary produces\nOviduct\nOvary\nUterus\nHead\nMiddle piece\nTail\nFig. 6.2 :  Human sperm\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 67\nSperm\nduct\nTestisPenis\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 68Boojho recalls that the size\nof eggs in animals varies.\nThe egg may be very small\nas in humans, much larger\nas in hens. Ostrich egg is\nthe largest!\nFertilisation\nThe first step in the process of\nreproduction is the fusion of a sperm\nand an ovum. When sperms come in\ncontact with an egg, one of the sperms\nmay fuse with the egg. Such fusion of\nthe egg and the sperm is called\nfertilisation (Fig. 6.5). During\nfertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and\nthe egg fuse to form a single nucleus.\nThis results in the formation of a\nfertilised egg or zygote (Fig. 6.6). Did\nFig. 6.5 :  Fertilisation\nFig. 6.4 :  Human OvumNucleusSperms\nOvum\nFusing\nnuclei\nThe process of fertilisation is the\nmeeting of an egg cell from the mother\nand a sper m cell fr om the father . So,\nthe new individual inherits some\ncharacteristics  from the mother and\nsome fr om the father . Look at your\nbrother or sister . See if you can r ecognise\nsome characters in them similar to those\nof your mother or your father .\nFertilisation which takes place inside\nthe female body is called internal\nfertilisation . Internal fertilisation\noccurs in many animals including\nhumans, cows, dogs and hens.Fig. 6.6 :  Zygotefemale gametes called ova (eggs)\n(Fig. 6.4). In human beings, a single\nmatured egg is released into the oviduct\nby one of the ovaries every month.\nUterus is the part where development of\nthe baby takes place. Like the sperm,\nan egg is also a single cell.\nyou know that the zygote is the\nbeginning of a new individual?\n2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 69Why do fish and\nfrogs lay eggs in\nhundreds whereas a\nhen lays only one\negg at a time?\nHave you heard of\ntest tube babies?\nBoojho and Paheli’s teacher once told\nthem in the class that in some women\noviducts are blocked. These women\nare unable to bear babies because\nsperms cannot reach the egg for\nfertilisation. In such cases, doctors\ncollect freshly released egg and\nsperms and keep them together for a\nfew hours for IVF or in vitro\nfertilisation  (fertilisation outside the\nbody). In case fertilisation occurs,\nthe zygote is allowed to develop for\nabout a week and then it is placed in\nthe mother’s uterus. Complete\ndevelopment takes place in the uterus\nand the baby is born like any other\nbaby. Babies born through this\ntechnique are called test-tube\nbabies . This term is actually\nmisleading because babies cannot\ngrow in test tubes.female lays hundreds of eggs. Unlike\nhen’s egg, frog’s egg is not covered by a\nshell and it is comparatively very\ndelicate. A layer of jelly holds the eggs\ntogether and provides protection to the\neggs (Fig. 6.7).\nYou will be surprised to know that\nin many animals fertili sation takes\nplace outside the body of the female.\nIn these animals, fertili sation takes\nplace in water . Let us find out how\nthis happens.\nActivity 6.1\nVisit some ponds or slow-flowing\nstreams during spring or rainy\nseason. Look out for clusters of\nfrog’s eggs floating in water .\nWrite down the colour and size of\nthe eggs.\nDuring spring or rainy season, frogs\nand toads move to ponds and slow-\nflowing streams. When the male and\nfemale come together in water , theAs the eggs are laid, the male\ndeposits sperms over them. Each\nsperm swims randomly in water with\nthe help of its long tail. The sperms\ncome in contact with the eggs. This\nresults in fertili sation. This type of\nfertilis ation in which the fusion of a\nmale and a female gamete takes place\noutside the body of the female is called\nexternal fertili sation . It is very\ncommon in aquatic animals such as\nfish, star fish\n, etc.\nFig. 6.7 :  Eggs of frog\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 70\nDevelopment of Embryo\nFertilisation results in the formation of\nzygote which begins to develop into an\nembryo [Fig. 6.8(a)]. The zygote divides\nrepeatedly to give rise to a ball of cells\n[Fig. 6.8(b)]. The cells then begin to form\ngroups that develop into different tissues\nand organs of the body. This developing\nstructure is termed an embryo . The\nembryo gets embedded in the wall of the\nuterus for further development\n[Fig. 6.8(c)].\nThe embryo continues to develop in\nthe uterus. It gradually develops body\nFig. 6.8 : (a) Zygote formation and development of an embryo from the zygote; (b) Ball of cells\n(enlarged); (c) Embedding of the embryo in the uterus (enlarged)How could a single cell\nbecome such a big\nindividual?\n(b)\n(a)\n(c)Uterus\nEmbedding\nembryoOvary\nOvulationZygote\nUterus\nwall\nDeveloping\nembryo\nThough these animals lay\nhundreds of eggs and release\nmillions of sperms, all the eggs\ndo not get fertilised and develop\ninto new individuals.\nThis is because the eggs and\nsperms get exposed to  water\nmovement, wind and rainfall.\nAlso, there are other animals in\nthe pond which may feed\non eggs. Thus, production\nof large number of eggs and\nsperms is necessary to\nensure fertilisation\nof at least\na few of them.\n2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 71parts such as hands, legs, head, eyes,\nears etc. The stage of the embryo in\nwhich all the body parts can be\nidentified is called a foetus (Fig. 6.9).\nWhen the development of the foetus is\ncomplete,  the mother gives birth to\nthe baby.place inside the egg shell during this\nperiod? After the chick is completely\ndeveloped it bursts open the egg shell.\nIn animals which undergo external\nfertilisation, development of the embryo\ntakes place outside the female body. The\nembryos continue to grow within their\negg coverings. After the embryos develop,\nthe eggs hatch. Y\nou must have seen\nnumerous tadpoles swimming in ponds\nand streams.\nViviparous and Oviparous Animals\nWe have learnt that some animals give\nbirth to young ones while some animals\nlay eggs which later develop into young\nones. The animals which give birth to\nyoung ones are called viviparous\nanimals. Those animals which lay eggs\nare called oviparous animals. The\nfollowing activity will help you\nunderstand better and differentiate\nbetween viviparous and oviparous\nanimals.\nActivity 6.2\nTry to observe eggs of the following\norganisms – fr og, lizar d, butter fly\nor moth, hen and crow or any other\nbir\nd. Were you able to observe eggs\nof all of them? Make drawings of  the\neggs that you have observed.\nThe eggs of a few animals are easy\nto observe because their mothers lay\nthem outside their bodies. These are\nexamples of oviparous animals. But you\nwould not be able to collect the eggs of\na dog, cow or cat. This is because they\ndo not lay eggs. The mother gives birth\nto the young ones. These are examples\nof viviparous animals.Internal fertilisation takes place in\nhens also. But, do hens give birth to\nbabies like human beings and cows? Y ou\nknow that they do not. Then, how are\nchicks born? Let us find out.\nSoon after fertilisation, the zygote\ndivides repeatedly and travels down the\noviduct. As it travels down, many\nprotective layers are formed around it.\nThe hard shell that you see in a hen’s\negg is one such pr otective layer .\nAfter the hard shell is formed around\nthe developing embryo, the hen finally\nlays the egg. The embryo takes about 3\nweeks to develop into a chick. Y ou must\nhave seen the hen sitting on the eggs to\nprovide sufficient warmth. Did you know\nthat development of the chick takesFig. 6.9 :  Foetus in the uterusUterus\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 72Can you now give some more\nexamples of viviparous and oviparous\nanimals?\nYoung Ones to Adults\nThe new individuals which are born or\nhatched from the eggs continue to grow\ntill they become adults. In some\nanimals, the young ones may look very\ndifferent from the adults. The life cycle\nof frog is shown in Fig. 6.10.\nObserve the different stages of frog\nstarting from the egg to the adult stage.\nWe find that ther e are thr ee distinct\nstages, that is, egg → tadpole (larva) →\nadult. Don’t the tadpoles look so\ndifferent from the adults? Can you\nimagine that these tadpoles would some\nday become frogs?The tadpoles transform into adults\ncapable of jumping and swimming. The\ntransformation of the larva into an adult\nthrough drastic changes is called\nmetamorphosis . What about the\nchanges that we observe in our body as\nwe grow? Do you think we too undergo\nmetamorphosis? In human beings,\nbody parts similar to those present in\nthe adults are present from the time\nof birth.\n6.3 Asexual Reproduction\nSo far , we have lear nt about r eproduction\nin some familiar animals.

These bulges are the\ndeveloping new individuals and they are\ncalled buds. Recall the presence of buds\nin yeast. In hydra too the new individuals\ndevelop as outgrowths from a single\nparent. This type of reproduction in\nwhich only a single parent is involved is\ncalled asexual reproduction . Since new\nindividuals develop from the buds in\nhydra, this type of asexual reproduction\nis called budding .\nAnother method of asexual\nreproduction is observed in the\nmicroscopic organism, amoeba. Let us\nsee how this happens.\nYou have alr eady lear nt about the\nstructur e of amoeba. Y ou will r ecall that\namoeba is a single-celled organism\n[Fig. 6.12(a)]. It begins the process of\nreproduction by the division of its\nnucleus into two nuclei [Fig. 6.12(b)].\nThis is followed by division of its body\ninto two, each part receiving a nucleus\n[Fig. 6.12(c)].

Cloning of an animal was successfully performed for the first\ntime by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh,\nScotland. They successfully cloned a sheep named Dolly [Fig. 6.13 (c)]. Dolly was\nborn on 5th July 1996 and was the first mammal to be cloned.\n(a) Finn Dorsett sheep (b) Scottish blackface ewe (c) Dolly\nFig. 6.13\nDuring the process of cloning Dolly, a cell was collected from the mammary gland\nof a female Finn Dorsett sheep [Fig. 6.13 (a)]. Simultaneously, an egg was obtained\nfrom a Scottish blackface ewe [Fig. 6.13 (b)]. The nucleus was removed from the\negg. Then, the nucleus of the mammary gland cell from the Finn Dorsett sheep\nwas inserted into the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe whose nucleus had been\nremoved. The egg thus produced was implanted into the Scottish blackface ewe.\nDevelopment of this egg followed normally and finally Dolly was born. Though\nDolly was given birth by the Scottish blackface ewe, it was found to be absolutely\nidentical to the Finn Dorsett sheep from which the nucleus was taken. Since the\nnucleus from the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe was removed, Dolly did not\nshow any character of the Scottish blackface ewe. Dolly was a healthy clone of\nthe Finn Dorsett sheep and produced several offspring of her own through normal\nsexual means. Unfortunately, Dolly died on 14th February 2003 due to a certain\nlung disease.\nSince Dolly, several attempts have been made to produce cloned mammals.\nHowever , many die befor e birth or die soon after birth. The cloned animals ar e\nmany-a-times found to be born with severe abnormalities.\nreproduction in which an animal\nreproduces by dividing into two\nindividuals is called binary fission .\nApart from budding and binary fission,there are other methods by which a\nsingle parent reproduces young ones.\nYou will study about these in your\nhigher classes.\n2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 75\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nASEXUAL\nREPRODUCTION\nBINARY FISSION\nBUDDING\nEGGS\nEMBRYO\nEXTERNAL\nFERTILISA TION\nFERTILISA TION\nFOETUS\nINTERNAL\nFERTILISA TION\nMETAMORPHOSIS\nOVIPAROUS ANIMALS\nSEXUAL\nREPRODUCTION\nSPERMS\nVIVIP AROUS ANIMALS\nZYGOTE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\nÜThere are two modes by which animals repro-\nduce.

{"class": "8", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 7: reaching the age of adolescence", "content": "In the pr evious chapter , you have\nlearnt how animals reproduce. It is\nonly after ‘growing up’ to a certain\nage that human beings and many other\nanimals can reproduce. Why can\nhumans reproduce only after a certain\nage?\nIn this chapter , you will lear n about\nchanges that take place in the human\nbody after which a person becomes\ncapable of reproduction.\nIn Chapter 6, you \nhave learnt about\nhuman reproductive organs. Here, we\nshall discuss the role that hormones play\nin bringing about changes that make a\nchild grow into an adult.\n7.1 Adolescence and Puberty\nBoojho was celebrating his 12th\nbirthday. After his friends left, Boojho\nand Paheli began chatting with their\nparents. Paheli studies in an all-girls\nschool. She started laughing. She\nremarked that many of Boojho’s  school\nfriends, whom she met after a year , had\nsuddenly shot up in height. Some of\nthem were looking very funny with a\nhairy line above their lips. Her mother\nexplained that the boys had grown up.\nGrowth begins from the day one is\nborn. But upon crossing the age of 10\nor 11, there is a sudden spurt in growth\nwhich becomes noticeable. The changes\ntaking place in the body are part of\ngrowing up. They indicate that you areI wonder how long this\nperiod marked by changes\nin the body will last!\nno longer  a child but are on the way to\nbecoming an adult.\nIt is a strange period of life\nwhen you are neither a child nor\nan adult. I wonder whether this\nperiod between childhood and\nadulthood had a special name!\nGrowing up is a natural process. The\nperiod of life, when the body undergoes\nchanges, leading to reproductive\nmaturity, is called adolescence.\nAdolescence begins around the age of\n11 and lasts upto 18 or 19 years of age.\nSince this period covers the ‘teens’ (13\nto 18 or 19 years of age), adolescents\nare also called ‘teenagers’. In girls,\nadolescence may begin a year or two\nearlier than in boys. Also, the period of\nadolescence  varies  from person to person.\nThe human body undergoes several\nchanges during adolescence. These\nchanges mark the onset of puberty . The\nmost important change which marks\npuberty is that boys and girls become\ncapable of reproduction. Puberty ends\nwhen an adolescent reaches reproductive\nmaturity.\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE REACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 80\n% of full height\nBoys Girls\n8 72% 77%\n9 75% 81%\n10 78% 84%\n11 81% 88%\n12 84% 91%\n13 88% 95%\n14 92% 98%\n15 95% 99%\n16 98% 99.5%\n17 99% 100%\n18 100% 100%Age in\nYearsPaheli and Boojho\nrealised that sudden\nincrease in height and\nhairy line above the lips\nin boys were signs of\nadolescence. They\nwanted to know more\nabout other changes at\npuberty.\n7.2 Changes at Puberty\nIncrease in Height\nThe most conspicuous change during\npuberty is the sudden increase in\nheight. At this time the long bones, that\nis, the bones of the arms and the legs\nelongate and make a person tall.\nActivity 7.1\nThe following chart gives the\naverage rate of growth in height of\nboys and girls with age. The figures\nin columns 2 and 3, give the\npercentage of the height a person\nhas reached at the age given in\ncolumn 1. For example, by the age\n11, a boy has reached 81% of his\nprobable full height, while a girl\nhas reached 88% of her full\nheight. These figures are only\nrepresentative and there may be\nindividual variations.\nUse the Table for your friends\nand work out how tall they are likely\nto be. Find out who is likely to beCalculation for full height (cm)\n( )100Presentheight cm\n%of fullheightatthisage×\n    (as given in the chart)\nExample:\nA boy is 9 years old and 120 cm\ntall. At the end of the growth period\nhe is likely to be\n×12010075 cm = 160 cm tallthe tallest and who might be the\nshortest in your class.\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 81There is no need for Paheli to worry.\nAll parts of the body do not grow at the\nsame rate. Sometimes the arms and legs\nor hands and feet of adolescents look\noversized and out of proportion with the\nbody. But soon the other parts catch\nup and result in a proportionate body.\nYou must have noticed that height\nof an individual is more or less similar\nto that of some family member . This is\nbecause height depends on the genes\ninherited fr om par ents. It is, however ,\nvery important to eat the right kind of\nfood during these growing years. This\nhelps the bones, muscles and other\nparts of the body get adequate\nnourishment for gr owth. Y ou will find\nnutritional needs of adolescents\ndiscussed later in the lesson.\nChange in Body Shape\nHave you noticed that boys in your class\nhave broader shoulders and wider chests\nthan boys in  junior classes? This is\nbecause they have entered the age of\npuberty when shoulders generally\nbroaden as a result of growth. In girls,\nthe region below the waist becomes\nwider .\nIn boys, the muscles of the body grow\nmore prominently than in the girls.\nThus, changes occurring in adolescent\nboys and girls are different.\nVoice Change\nDid you notice that sometimes the voice\nof some of the boys in your class cracks?\nAt puberty, the voice box  or the larynx\nbegins to grow. Boys develop larger voice\nboxes. The growing voice box in boys can\nbe seen as a protruding part of the throatActivity 7.2\nUse the data given in Activity 7.1 to\ndraw a graph. Take age on the\nX-axis and per cent growth in height\non the Y-axis. Highlight the point\nrepresenting your age on the graph.\nFind out the percentage of height\nyou have already reached. Calculate\nthe height you might eventually\nreach. Tally your graph with the one\ngiven here (Fig. 7.1).\nFig. 7.1 : Graph showing percentage of height\nwith age\nI am worried. Though I\nhave become taller , my\nface looks much smaller\ncompared to my body.\nInitially, girls grow faster than boys\nbut by about 18 years of age, both reach\ntheir maximum height. The rate of\ngrowth in height varies in different\nindividuals. Some may grow suddenly\nat puberty and then slow down, while\nothers may grow gradually.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 82and pimples on the face at this time\nbecause of the increased activity of these\nglands in the skin.\nDevelopment of Sex Organs\nLook up Fig. 6.1 and 6.3 of the\nprevious lesson which show sex\norgans of humans. At puberty, male\nsex organs like the testes and penis\ndevelop completely. The testes also\nbegin to produce sperms. In girls, the\novaries enlarge and eggs begin to\nmature. Also ovaries start releasing\nmature eggs.\nReaching Mental, Intellectual and\nEmotional Maturity\nAdolescence is also a period of change\nin a person’s way of thinking.\nAdolescents are more independent than\nbefore and are also self conscious.\nIntellectual development takes place and\nthey tend to spend considerable time\nthinking. In fact, it is often the time in\none’s life when the brain has the\ngreatest capacity for learning.\nSometimes, however , an adolescent may\nfeel insecure while trying to adjust to\nthe changes in the body and mind. But\nas adolescent learners, you should know\nthat there is no reason to feel insecure.\nThese changes are a natural part of\ngrowing up.\n7.3 Secondary Sexual\nCharacters\nYou have lear nt in Chapter 6, that\ntestes and ovaries are the reproductive\norgans. They produce the gametes,\nthat is, sperms and ova. In girls,\nbreasts begin to develop at pubertyMany of my classmates\nhave a hoarse voice. Now I\nknow why?\nFig. 7.2 : Adam’s apple in a grown up boycalled Adam’s apple  (Fig. 7.2). In girls,\nthe larynx is hardly visible from the\noutside because of its small size.\nGenerally, girls have a high pitched voice,\nwhereas boys have a deep voice. In\nadolescent boys, sometimes, the muscles\nof the growing voice box go out of control\nand the voice becomes hoarse. This state\nmay remain for a few days or weeks after\nwhich the voice becomes normal.\nA few glands such as sweat glands,\noil glands and salivary glands release\ntheir secretions through ducts.\nEndocrine glands release hormones\ndirectly into the bloodstream. So, they\nare also termed ductless glands.Increased Activity of Sweat and\nSebaceous Glands\nDuring puberty the secretion of sweat\nglands and sebaceous glands (oil glands)\nincreases. Many young people get acneAdam’s\napple\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 83and boys begin to gr ow facial hair , that\nis, moustaches and beard. As these\nfeatures help to distinguish the male\nfrom the female they are called\nsecondary sexual characters . Boys\nalso develop hair on their chest. In\nboth, boys and girls, hair grows under\nthe arms and in the region above the\nthighs or the pubic region.\nPaheli and Boojho have now\nunderstood that puberty marks the\nbeginning of the reproductive period\nwhen one becomes capable of\nreproduction. But they want to know\nif reproductive life, once begun,\ncontinues, or it ends some time.The testes and ovaries secrete sex\nhormones. Y ou have just lear nt that\nthese hormones are responsible for the\nmale and female secondary sexual\ncharacters. Further , the sex hor mones\nare under the control of hormones from\nthe pituitary gland (Fig. 7.3). The\npituitary secretes many hormones, one\nof which makes ova mature in the\novaries and sperms form in the testes.\nBoth Boojho and Paheli wish to know\nwhat initiates changes at puberty.\nFig. 7.3 : The onset of puberty is controlled by\nhormonesThe changes which occur at\nadolescence are controlled by\nhormones. Hormones are chemical\nsubstances. These are secretions from\nendocrine glands , or endocrine system.\nThe male hormone or testosterone\nbegins to be released by the testes at\nthe onset of puberty. This causes\nchanges in boys about which you have\njust learnt, for example, the growth of\nfacial hair . Once puberty is r eached in\ngirls, ovaries begin to produce the female\nhormone\n or estrogen which makes the\nbreasts develop. Milk secreting glands\nor mammary glands develop inside the\nbreasts. The production of these\nhormones is under the control of\nanother hormone secreted from an\nendocrine gland called pituitary gland .\n7.4 Role of Hormones in\nInitiating Reproductive\nFunction\nEndocrine glands release hormones\ninto the bloodstream to reach a\nparticular body part called target site .\nThe target site responds to the\nhormone. There are many endocrine\nglands  or ductless glands in the body.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 847.5 Reproductive Phase of\nLife in Humans\nAdolescents become capable of\nreproduction when their testes and\novaries begin to produce gametes. The\ncapacity for maturation  and production\nof gametes lasts for a much longer time\nin males than in females.\nIn females, the reproductive phase of\nlife begins at puberty (10 to 12 years of\nage) and generally lasts till the age of\napproximately 45 to 50 years. The ova\nbegin to mature with the onset of\npuberty. One ovum matures and is\nreleased by one of the ovaries once in\nabout 28 to 30 days. During this\nperiod, the wall of the uterus becomes\nthick so as to receive the egg, in case\nit is fertilised and begins to develop.\nThis results in pregnancy. If\nfertilisation does not occur , the\nreleased egg, and the thickened lining\nof the uterus along with its blood\nvessels are shed off. This causes\nbleeding in women which is called\nmenstruation . Menstruation occurs\nonce in about 28 to 30 days. The first\nmenstrual flow begins at puberty  and\nis termed menarche . At 45 to 50 years\nof age, the menstrual cycle stops.\nStoppage of menstruation is termed\nmenopause.  Initially, menstrual cycle\nmay be irr egular . It take some time to\nbecome r egular .Menstrual cycle is controlled by\nhormones. The cycle includes the\nmaturation of the egg, its release,\nthickening of uterine wall and its\nbreakdown if pregnancy does not\noccur . In case the egg is fertilised it\nbegins to divide and then gets\nembedded in the uterus for further\ndevelopment as you have learnt in\nChapter 6 (Fig. 6.8).\n7.6 How is the Sex of the\nBaby Determined?\nI heard my mother and my\naunt talking about my cousin\nwho is going to have a baby.\nThey were discussing whether\nshe would give birth to a boy\nor a girl. I wonder what makes\nthe fertilised egg develop\neither into a boy or a girl!\nPaheli says that the\nreproductive life of a\nwoman lasts from\nmenarche to menopause.\nIs she right?Boy or Girl?\nInside the fertilised egg or zygote is the\ninstruction for determining the sex of\nthe baby. This instruction is present in\nthe thread-like structures, called\nchromosomes  in the fertilised egg.\nChromosomes are present inside the\nnucleus of every cell. All human beings\nhave 23 pairs of chromosomes in the\nnuclei of their cells. Two chromosomes\nout of these are the sex chromosomes,\nnamed X and Y . A female has two X\nchromosomes, while a male has one X\nand one Y chromosome. The gametes\n(egg and sperm) have only one set of\nchromosomes. The unfertilised egg\nalways has one X chromosome. But\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 85sperms are of two kinds. One kind has\nan X chromosome, and the other kind\nhas a Y chromosome.\nSee Fig. 7.4. When a sperm\ncontaining X chromosome fertilises the\negg, the zygote would have two X\nchromosomes and develop into a female\nchild. If the sperm contributes a Y\nchromosome to the egg (ovum) at\nfertilisation, the zygote would develop\ninto a male child.and ovaries to produce their hormones.\nYou have alr eady lear nt that the\npituitary gland is an endocrine gland.\nIt is attached to the brain.\nApart from the pituitary, the testes\nand the ovaries, there are other\nendocrine glands in the body such as\nthyroid, pancreas and adrenals\n(Fig. 7.5).\nFig. 7.4 : Sex determination in humansboy girlsperms\neggs\nNow you know that the sex\nchromosomes of the father determine the\nsex of an unborn baby. The belief that\nthe mother is responsible for the sex of\nher baby is completely wrong and to\nblame her for this is totally unjustified.\n7.7 Hormones other than\nSex Hormones\nLook at Fig. 7.3 again. The hormones\nsecreted by the pituitary stimulate testesFig. 7.5 :Position of endocrine glands in the\nhuman body\npituitary\ngland\nthyroid gland\nadrenal\ngland\npancreas\ntestisposition of\nthe ovary in\nthe female\nBoojho and Paheli had once visited\ntheir aunt who was a doctor and\nremembered that a boy named Kaka had\na very big and bulging throat. Their aunt\nhad told them that Kaka was suffering\nfrom ‘goitre’, a disease of the thyroid\ngland . Kaka’s thyroid gland was not\nproducing the hormone thyroxine .\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 86Their aunt also told them that their\nuncle was suffering from ‘diabetes’\nbecause his pancreas was not producing\nthe hormone insulin  in sufficient\nquantities. Boojho and Paheli then\nasked their aunt about the adrenal\nglands, which are also shown in the\nchart hung on the wall of her clinic. The\naunt told them that adrenal glands\nsecrete hormones which maintain the\ncorrect salt balance in the blood.\nAdrenals also produce the hormone\nadrenalin. It helps the body to adjust\nto stress when one is very angry,\nembarrassed or worried.\nThyroid and adrenals secrete their\nhormones when they receive orders from\nthe pituitary through its hormones.\nPituitary also secretes growth hormone\nwhich is necessary for the normal\ngrowth of a person.controlled by insect hormones.  In a\nfrog, it is controlled by thyroxine, the\nhormone produced by thyroid.\nThyroxine production requires the\npresence of iodine in water . If the water\nin which the tadpoles are growing does\nnot contain sufficient iodine, the\ntadpoles cannot become adults.\n7.8 Role of Hormones in\nCompleting the Life\nHistory of Insects and\nFrogs\nYou have alr eady lear nt about the life\ncycle of the frog. The tadpole passes\nthrough certain stages to become a frog\n(Chapter 6). This change from larva to\nadult is called metamorphosis\n(Fig. 6.10). Metamorphosis in insects isCollect information from magazines\nor from doctors and prepare a note\non the importance of consuming\niodised salt. Y ou can also look for\nthis information on the internet.\n7.9 Reproductive Health\nThe physical and mental well being of\nan individual is regarded as an\nindividual’s health. To keep the body\nhealthy, every human being, at any age,\nneeds to have a balanced diet. The\nperson must also observe personal\nhygiene and undertake adequate\nphysical exercise.\nDuring adolescence, however , these\nbecome even more essential as the body\nis growing.\nNutritional Needs of the Adolescents\nAdolescence is a stage of rapid growth\nand development. Hence the diet for an\nAre there hormones in\nother animals also?

Recall that a balanced diet means\nthat the meals include proteins,\ncarbohydrates, fats and vitamins in\nrequisite proportions. Our Indian meal\nof roti/rice,  dal (pulses) and vegetables\nis a balanced meal. Milk is a balanced\nfood in itself. Fruits also provide\nnourishment. For infants, mother’s milk\nprovides all the nourishment that\nthey need.\nIron builds blood and iron-rich food\nsuch as leafy vegetables, jaggery, meat,\ncitrus, Indian gooseberry (amla)  are good\nfor adolescents.\nCheck items for lunch and dinner in\nyour meal. Is the meal balanced and\nnutritious? Does it include cereals\nwhich give energy and milk, meat, nuts\nand pulses which provide proteins for\ngrowth? Also, does it include fats and\nsugar that give energy? What about\nfruits and vegetables which are\nprotective foods?

{"class": "8", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 8: force and pressure", "content": "FORCE  AND PRESSURE FORCE AND PRESSURE\nIn Class VII, you have learnt how\nobjects move. Do you recall how we\ncan decide whether an object is\nmoving faster than the other? What does\nthe distance moved by an object in unit\ntime indicate? Y ou also know that a\nmoving object like a ball rolling on the\nground slows down. Sometimes it may\nchange its direction of motion. It is also\npossible that the ball may slow down\nand also change its direction. Have you\never wondered what makes an object\nslow down or go faster , or change its\ndirection of motion?\nLet us recall some of our everyday\nexperiences. What do you do to make\na football move? What do you do to\nmake a moving ball move faster? How\ndoes a  goalkeeper stop a ball ? A\nhockey player changes the direction\nof the moving ball with a flick of the\nstick . How do fielders stop a\n ball hitby a batsman?  (Fig. 8.1). In all these\nsituations the ball is either made to\nmove faster or slower or its direction\nof motion is changed.\nWe often say that a for ce has been\napplied on a ball when it is kicked,\npushed, thrown or flicked. What is a\nforce? What can it do to bodies on which\nit is applied? W e shall seek answers to\nsuch questions in this chapter .\n8.1 Force – A Push or a Pull\nActions like picking, opening,\nshutting, kicking, hitting, lifting,\nflicking, pushing, pulling are often\nused to describe certain tasks. Each\nof these actions usually results in\nsome kind of change in the  state of\nmotion of an object.  Can these terms\nbe replaced with one or more terms?\nLet us find out.\n(a) (b) (c)\nFig. 8.1 : (a) A goal keeper saving a goal, (b) A hockey player flicking a ball, and\n(c) A fielder stopping a ball\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 94\nActivity 8.1\nTable 8.1 gives some examples of familiar situations involving motion of objects.\nYou can add mor e such situations or r eplace those given her e. Try to identify\naction involved in each case as a push and/or a pull and record your observations.\nOne example has been given to help you.\nS.\nNo. Description of\nthe situationAction : (pushing/ pulling/picking/\nhitting/lifting/ lowering/flying/\nkicking/ throwing/shutting/\nflicking)Action can be\ngrouped as a\nPush\n1.

Opening a\ndrawerPushing Pulling Lifting — Yes Yes\nTable 8.1 : Identifying Actions as Push or Pull\nI learnt in Class VI that a\nmagnet attracts a piece of\niron towards it. Is attraction\nalso a pull? What about\nrepulsion between similar\npoles of two magnets? Is it a\npull or a push?Do you notice that each of the actions\ncan be grouped as a pull or a push or\nboth? Can we infer from this, that to move\nan object, it has to be pushed or pulled?\nIn science, a push or a pull on an\nobject is called a force . Thus, we can\nsay that the motion imparted to objects\nwas due to the action of a force. When\ndoes a force come into play? Let us\nfind out.   \nPull\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 95Fig. 8.3 (b) : Who is pulling whom ?\n8.2 Forces are due to an\nInteraction\nSuppose a man is standing behind a\nstationary car [Fig.8.2(a)]. Will the car\nmove due to his presence? Suppose the\nman now begins to push the car\n[Fig.8.2(b)], that is, he applies a force\non it. The car  may begin to move in theFig. 8.3 shows three situations that\nmay be familiar to you. Can you decide\nwho is pulling and who is pushing in\nthese cases? In Fig. 8.3 (a), both the girls\nappear to push each other while\nFig. 8.2 (b) :  A car being pushed by a man\nFig. 8.3  (a)  : Who is pushing whom?\ndirection of the applied force. Note that the\nman has to push the car to make it move.Fig. 8.2(a) : A man standing behind a stationary car\nFig. 8.3 (c) :  Who is pulling whom ?\nthe pair of girls in Fig. 8.3 (b) are trying\nto pull each other . Similarly, the cow\nand the man in Fig. 8.3 (c) appear to\npull each other . The girls in the two\nsituations shown here are applying force\non each other . Is it also true for the man\nand the cow?\nFrom these examples, we can infer\nthat at least two objects must interact\nfor a force to come into play. Thus, an\ninteraction of one object with another\nobject results in a force between the\ntwo objects.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 96Does it mean that the net\nforce on an object is zero if the\ntwo forces acting on it in\nopposite directions are equal?\nrope in their direction. Sometimes the rope\nsimply does not move. Is it not similar to\nthe situation shown in Fig. 8.3 (b)? The\nteam that pulls har der, that is, applies a\nlarger force, finally wins the game.\nWhat do these examples suggest\nabout the nature of force?\nForces applied on an object \nin the\nsame dir ection add  to one another . Now\nrecall what happened when you and\nyour friend pushed the heavy box in the\nsame direction in Activity 8.2.\nIf the two forces act in the opposite\ndirections on an object, the net force acting\non it is the difference between the two\nforces . What did you observe in Activity\n8.2 when both of you were pushing the\nheavy box from opposite directions?\nRecall that in the tug-of-war when\ntwo teams pull equally hard, the rope\ndoes not move in any direction.\nSo, we learn that a force could be\nlarger or smaller than the other or equal\nto each other . The strength of a force is\nusually expr essed by its magnitude . We\nhave also to specify the direction in\nwhich a force acts. Also, if the direction\nor the magnitude of the applied force\nchanges, its effect also changes.Activity 8.2\nChoose a heavy object like a table\nor a box, which you can move only\nby pushing har d. Try to push it all\nby yourself. Can you move it? Now\nask one of your friends to help you\nin pushing it in the same direction\n[Fig. 8.4(a)]. Is it easier to move it\nnow? Can you explain why?\nNow push the same object, but\nask your friend to push it from the\nopposite side [Fig. 8.4 (b)]. Does the\nobject move? If it does, note the\ndirection in which it moves. Can\nyou guess which one of you is\napplying a larger force?\nFig. 8.4 :  Two friends pushing a heavy load\n(a) in the same direction, (b) in\nopposite direction(a)\n(b)8.3 Exploring Forces\nLet us try to learn more about forces.\nFig. 8.5 : The rope may not move if the two\nteams pull at it with equal force\nHave you ever seen a game of tug-of\nwar? In this game two teams pull at a\nrope in opposite directions (Fig. 8.5).\nMembers of both the teams try to pull the\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 97In general, more than one force may\nbe acting on an object. However , the\neffect on the object is due to the net\nforce acting on it.\n8.4 A Force can Change the\nState of Motion\nLet us now find out what happens when\na force acts on an object.\nActivity 8.3\nTake a rubber ball and place it on a\nlevel sur face such as a table top or\na concr ete floor . Now, gently push\nthe ball along the level sur face\n(Fig. 8.6). Does the ball begin to\nmove? Push the ball again while it\nis still moving. Is there any change\nin its speed? Does it increase or\ndecrease?\nNext, place your palm in front\nof the moving ball. Remove your\npalm as soon as the moving ball\ntouches it. Does your palm apply a\nforce on the ball? What happens to\nthe speed of the ball now? Does it\nincrease or decrease? What would\nhappen if you let your palm hold\nthe moving ball?\nFig. 8.6  : A ball at rest begins to move\nwhen a force is applied on itI have seen\nchildren competing with one\nanother in moving a rubber tyre\nor a ring by pushing it\n(Fig. 8.7).  I now understand\nwhy the speed of the tyre\nincreases whenever it is\npushed.\nFig. 8.7 : To move a tyre faster it has to be\npushed repeatedly\nYou might r ecall similar situations.\nFor example, while taking a penalty kick\nin football, the player applies a force on\nthe ball. Before being hit, the ball was at\nrest and so its speed was zero. The\napplied force makes the ball move\ntowards the goal. Suppose, the\ngoalkeeper dives or jumps up to save the\ngoal. By his action the goalkeeper tries\nto apply a force on the moving ball. The\nforce applied by him can stop or deflect\nthe ball, saving a goal being scored. If\nthe goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the\nball, its speed decreases to zero.\nThese observations suggest that a\nforce applied on an object may change\nits speed. If the force applied on the object\nis in the direction of its motion, the speed\nof the object increases. If the force is\napplied in the direction opposite to the\ndirection of motion, then it results in a\ndecrease in the speed of the object.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 98Let us consider some more\nexamples. In a game of volleyball,\nplayers often push the moving ball to\ntheir team  mates to make a winning\nmove. Sometimes the ball is returned\nto the other side of the court by\npushing or smashing it. In cricket,  a\nbatsman plays his or her shot by\napplying a force on the ball with the\nbat. Is there any change in the\ndirection of motion of the ball in these\ncases? In all these examples the speed\nand the direction of the moving ball\nchange due to the application of a\nforce. Can you give a few more\nexamples of this kind?\nA change in either the speed of an\nobject, or its direction of motion, or both,\nis described as a change in its state of\nmotion . Thus, a force may bring a\nchange in the state of motion of an\nobject.\nFig. 8.8 : (a) A ball set in motion by\npushing it along a level surface\nand (b) the direction of motion\nof the ball after it strikes the\nruler placed in its path(a)State of Motion\nThe state of motion of an object is\ndescribed by its speed and the\ndirection of motion. The state of rest\nis considered to be the state of zero\nspeed. An object may be at rest or in\nmotion; both are its states of motion.Paheli is curious to know whether\napplication of a force can only change the\nspeed of an object. Let us find out.\nActivity 8.4\nTake a ball and place it on a level\nsurface as you did in Activity 8.3.\nMake the ball move by giving it a\npush [Fig. 8.8(a)]. Now place a ruler\nin its path as shown in Fig. 8.8(b).\nIn doing so, you would apply a force\non the moving ball. Does the ball\ncontinue to move in the same\ndirection after it strikes the ruler?\nRepeat the activity and try to\nobstruct the moving ball by placing\nthe ruler in such a way that it\nmakes different angles to its path.\nIn each case note your observations\nabout the direction of motion of the\nball after it strikes the ruler .\n(b)Does it mean that the application of\na force would always result in a change\nin the state of motion of the object? Let\nus find out.\nIt is common experience that many\na time application of force does not result\nin a change in the state of motion. For\nexample, a heavy box may not move at\nall even if you apply the maximum force\nthat you can exert. Again, no effect of\nforce is observed when you try to push\na wall.\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 998.5 Force can Change the\nShape of an Object\nDescription of\nSituationHow to Apply\nForceDiagram Action of Force\nChange in\nState of\nMotionChange in\nShape\nYes No Yes No\nPressing it down\nwith your hands.\nBy sitting on the\nseat.\nBy hanging a\nweight or by\npulling its free end.\nBy putting a weight\nat the centre of the\nscale.Table 8.2 : Studying the Effect of Force on Objects\nActivity 8.5\nSome situations have been given in Column 1 of Table 8.2 in which\nobjects are not free to move.  Column 2 of the Table suggests the manner\nin which a force can be applied on each object while Column 3 shows a\ndiagram of the action. T ry to observe the ef fect of for ce in as many\nsituations as possible. Y ou can also add similar situations using available\nmaterial from your environment. Note your observations in Columns 4\nand 5 of the Table.\nA lump of\ndough on a\nplate.\nSpring fixed to\nthe seat of a\nbicycle.\nA rubber band\nsuspended from\na hook/nail\nfixed on a wall.\nA plastic or\nmetal scale\nplaced between\ntwo bricks.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 100\nFig. 8.9 : Muscular force of animals is used to\ncarry out many difficult tasksWhat do you conclude from the\nobservations noted in Table 8.2? What\nhappens when you apply a force on\nan inflated balloon by pressing it\nbetween your palms? What happens\nto the shape of a ball of dough when it\nis rolled to make a chapati ? What\nhappens when  you press a rubber ball\nplaced on a table? In all these\nexamples you saw that the application\nof force on an object may change\nits shape .\nHaving per formed all the above\nactivities, you would have realised  that\na force\nlmay make an object move from rest.\nlmay change the speed of an object\nif it is moving.\nlmay change the direction of motion\nof an object.\nlmay bring about a change in the\nshape of an object.\nlmay cause some or all of these\neffects.\nWhile a force may cause one or more\nof these effects, it is important to\nremember that none of these actions can\ntake place without the action of a force.\nThus, an object cannot move by itself,\nit cannot change speed by itself, it\ncannot change direction by itself and\nits shape cannot change by itself.\n8.6 Contact Forces\nMuscular Force\nCan you push or lift a book lying on a\ntable without touching it? Can you lift\na bucket of water without holding it?\nGenerally, to apply a force on an object,\nyour body has to be in contact with the\nobject. The contact may also be with thehelp of a stick or a piece of rope.  When\nwe push an object like a school bag or\nlift a bucket of water, wher e does the\nforce come from? This force is caused\nby the action of muscles in our body.\nThe force resulting due to the action of\nmuscles is known as the muscular\nforce .\nIt is the muscular force that enables\nus to perform all activities involving\nmovement or bending of our body. In\nClass VII you have learnt that in the\nprocess of digestion the food gets\npushed through the alimentary canal.\nCould it be a muscular force that does\nit? You also know that lungs expand\nand contract while we inhale and\nexhale air during breathing. Where\nare these muscles located which\nmake breathing possible? Can you list\na few more examples of the force\nexerted by the muscles in our body?\nAnimals also make use of muscular\nforce to carry out their physical activities\nand other tasks. Animals like bullocks,\nhorses, donkeys and camels are used to\nperfor m various tasks for us. In\nperforming these tasks they use\nmuscular force (Fig. 8.9).\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 101Since muscular force can be applied\nonly when it is in contact with an object,\nit is also called a contact force . Are there\nother types of contact forces? Let us find\nout.\nFriction\nRecall some of your experiences. A ball\nrolling along the ground gradually slows\ndown and finally comes to rest. When\nwe stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually\nslows down and finally comes to a stop.\nA car or a scooter also comes to rest\nonce its engine is switched off. Similarly,\na boat comes to rest if we stop rowing\nit. Can you add some more such\nexperiences?\nIn all these situations no force\nappears to be acting on the objects, yet\ntheir speed gradually decreases and\nthey come to rest after some time. What\ncauses a change in their state of motion?\nCould some force be acting on them!\nCan you guess the direction in which\nthe force must be acting in each case?\nThe force responsible for changing the\nstate of motion of objects in all these\nexamples is the force of friction . It is the\nforce of friction between the sur face of\nthe ball and the ground that brings the\nmoving ball to rest. Similarly, friction\nbetween water and the boat brings it to\na stop once you stop rowing.\nThe force of friction always acts on\nall the moving objects and its direction\nis always opposite to the direction of\nmotion. Since the force of friction arises\ndue to contact between sur faces, it is\nalso an example of a contact for ce. You\nwill learn more about this force in\nChapter 9.\nYou may be wondering whether it is\nessential for the agent applying a forceon an object to be always in contact with\nit. Let us find out.\n8.7 Non-contact Forces\nMagnetic Force\nActivity 8.6\nTake a pair of bar magnets. Place\nthe longer side of one of the magnets\nover three round shaped pencils or\nwooden rollers as shown in\nFig. 8.10. Now bring one end of the\nother magnet near the end of the\nmagnet placed on the rollers. Make\nsure that the two magnets do not\ntouch each other . Observe what\nhappens. Next, bring the other end\nof the magnet near the same end\nof the magnet placed on the rollers\n(Fig.8.10). Note what happens to\nthe magnet placed on the rollers\nevery time another magnet is\nbrought near it.\nFig. 8.10 :  Observing attraction and repulsion\nbetween two magnets\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 102 Fig.  8.11 : A straw rubbed with paper attracts\nanother straw but repels it if it has\nalso been rubbed with a sheet\nof paper\nA straw is said to have acquired\nelectrostatic charge after it has been\nrubbed with a sheet of paper . Such a\nstraw is an example of a charged body.\nThe force exerted by a charged body\non another charged or uncharged body\nis known as electrostatic force . This\nforce comes into play even when the\nbodies are not in contact. The\nelectrostatic force, therefore, is another\nexample of a non-contact for ce. You will\nlearn more about electric charges in\nChapter 12.\nGravitational Force\nYou know that a coin or a pen falls to the\nground when it slips off your hand.\nLeaves and fruits also fall to the ground\nwhen they get detached from the plant.\nHave you ever wondered why it is so?\nWhen the coin is held in your hand it\nis at rest. As soon as it is released, it\nbegins to move downwards. It is clear that\nthe state of motion of the coin undergoes\na change. Can this happen without a\nforce acting on it?  Which is this force?Does the magnet on the rollers begin\nto move when the other magnet is brought\nnear it? Does it always move in the\ndirection of the approaching magnet?\nWhat do these observations suggest? Does\nit mean that some force must be acting\nbetween the two magnets?\nYou have lear nt in Class VI that like\npoles of two magnets repel each other and\nunlike poles attract each other . Attraction\nor repulsion between objects can also be\nseen as another form of pull or push. Do\nyou have to bring the magnets in contact\nfor observing the force between them? A\nmagnet can exert a force on another\nmagnet without being in contact with it.\nThe force exerted by a magnet is an\nexample of a non-contact force .\nSimilarly, the force exerted by a\nmagnet on a piece of iron is also a\nnon-contact force.\nElectrostatic Force\nActivity 8.7\nTake a plastic straw and cut it into\nnearly two equal pieces. Suspend one\nof the pieces from the edge of a table\nwith the help of a piece of thread\n(Fig. 8.11). Now hold the other piece\nof straw in your hand and rub its\nfree end with a sheet of paper . Bring\nthe rubbed end of the straw near the\nsuspended straw. Make sure that the\ntwo pieces do not touch each other .\nWhat do you observe?\nNext, rub the free end of the\nsuspended piece of straw with a\nsheet of paper . Again, bring the\npiece of straw that was rubbed\nearlier with paper near the free end\nof the suspended straw. What do you\nobserve now?\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 103Objects or things fall towards the\nearth because it pulls them. This force\nis called the force of gravity , or just\ngravity. This is an attractive force. The\nforce of gravity acts on all objects. The\nforce of gravity acts on all of us all the\ntime without our being awar e of it.

By\ndoing this they increase the\narea of contact of the load\nwith their head.

This envelop of air is known as the\natmosphere . The atmospheric air\nextends up to many kilometres above\nthe sur face of the earth. The pressure\nexerted by this air is known as\natmospheric pressur e\n. We know that\npressure is force per unit area. If we\nimagine a unit area and a very long\ncylinder standing on it filled with air ,\nthen the force of gravity on the air in\nthis cylinder is the atmospheric\npressure (Fig. 8.17).\nFig. 8.18 : A rubber sucker pressed on a\nsurface\nWhen you pr ess the sucker , most of\nthe air between its cup and the sur face\nescapes out.

The reason we\nare not crushed under this force of\ngravity is that the pressure inside our\nbodies is also equal to the atmospheric\npressure and balances the pressure from\noutside.\nDid you know?\nOtto von Guericke, a German scientist of the 17th century, invented a pump to\nextract air out of a vessel. With the help of this pump, he demonstrated\ndramatically the force of the air pressure. He joined two hollow metallic\nhemispheres of 51 cm diameter each and pumped air out of them. Then he\nemployed eight horses on each hemisphere to pull them apart (Fig. 8.20). So\ngreat is the force of air pressure that the hemispheres could not be pulled apart.\nFig. 8.20 :  Horses pulling the hemispheres\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 108\n     KEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDS\nATMOSPHERIC\nPRESSURE\nCONTACT FORCE\nELECTROSTATIC\nFORCE\nFORCE\nFRICTION\nGRAVITATIONAL\nFORCE\nGRAVITY\nMAGNETIC FORCE\nMUSCULAR FORCE\nNON-CONTACT\nFORCE\nPRESSURE\nPULL\nPUSH WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\nÜForce could be a push or a pull.\nÜA force arises due to the interaction between\ntwo objects.\nÜForce has magnitude as well as direction.\nÜA change in the speed of an object or the di-\nrection of its motion or both implies a change\nin its state of motion.\nÜForce acting on an object may cause a change\nin its state of motion or a change in its shape.\nÜA force can act on an object with or without\nbeing in contact with it.\nÜForce per unit area is called pressure.\nÜLiquids and gases exert pressure on the walls\nof their containers.\nÜThe pressure exerted by air around us is\nknown as atmospheric pressure.\nExercises\n1.Give two examples each of situations in which you push or pull to change\nthe state of motion of objects.\n2.Give two examples of situations in which applied force causes a change in\nthe shape of an object.\n3.Fill in the blanks in the following statements.\n(a)To draw water from a well we have to __________ at the rope.\n(b)A charged body __________ an uncharged body towards it.\n(c)To move a loaded trolley we have to __________ it.\n(d)The north pole of a magnet __________the north pole of another\nmagnet.\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 109  4.An archer stretches her bow while taking aim at the target.

Is\nit easier to hold a kulhar\n (earthen pot)\nor a glass tumbler? Suppose the outer\nsurface of the tumbler is greasy, or has\na thin layer of cooking oil on it; would it\nbecome easier or more difficult to hold\nit? Just think : would it be possible to\nhold the glass at all if there is no\nfriction?\nRecall also how difficult it is to move\non a wet muddy track, or wet marble\nfloor. Can you imagine being able to walk\nat all if there were no friction?\nYou could not write with pen or\npencil if there were no friction.  When\nyour teacher is writing with chalk on\nthe blackboard, its r ough sur face rubs\noff some chalk particles which stick to Recall your experience when last time\nyou moved a heavy box from one place\nto another (Fig. 9.6). If you have no such\nexperience, get that experience now.\nWhat is easier — to move the box from\nrest, or to move it when it is already in\nmotion?\nThe force required to overcome\nfriction at the instant an object starts\nmoving from rest is a measure of static\nfriction. On the other hand, the force\nrequired to keep the object moving with\nthe same speed is a measure of sliding\nfriction.\nWhen the box starts sliding, the\ncontact points on its sur face, do not get\nenough time to lock into the contact\npoints on the floor . So, the sliding\nfriction is slightly smaller than the staticFig. 9.7 : A nail is fixed in the wall due to\nfriction\nFig. 9.6 : You have to push on the box to keep it\nmoving\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 116\nthe black board. Could it happen if there\nwere no friction between the chalk and\nthe board?\nIf an object started moving, it would\nnever stop if there were no friction. Had\nthere been no friction between the tyres\nof the automobiles and the road, they\ncould not be started or stopped or\nturned to change the direction of\nmotion. Y ou could not fix a nail on the\nwall (Fig. 9.7) or tie a knot. Without\nfriction no building could be constructed.\nFig.  9.8 : Soles of shoes wear out due\nto friction\nFig.  9.10 : Stricking a matchstick produces fire\nby friction\nproduces heat. In fact, when a machine\nis operated, heat generated causes much\nwastage of energy. W e shall discuss the\nways of minimising friction in the\nfollowing section.\nFig.  9.9 : Rubbing of your palms makes you\nfeel warm\nOn the other hand, friction is an evil,\ntoo. It wears out the materials whether\nthey are screws, ball bearings or soles\nof shoes (Fig. 9.8). Y ou must have seen\nworn-out steps of foot over -bridges at\nrailway stations.\nFriction can also produce heat.\nVigorously rub your palms together for\na few minutes (Fig. 9.9). How do you\nfeel? When you strike a matchstick\nagainst the r ough sur face, it catches fir e\n(Fig. 9.10).\nYou might have observed that the jar\nof a mixer becomes hot when it is runfor a few minutes.

It\nis done to provide the shoes better grip\non the floor , so that you can move safely.\nSimilarly, the treaded tyres of cars,trucks\nand bulldozers provide better grip with\nthe ground.In some situations, however , friction\nis undesirable and we would want to\nminimise it.\nWhy do you sprinkle fine powder on\nthe carr om boar d (Fig. 9.12)? Y ou might\nhave noticed that when a few drops of\noil ar e pour ed on the hinges of a door,\nthe door moves smoothly. A bicycle and\na motor mechanic uses grease between\nthe moving parts of these machines. In\nall the above cases, we want to reduce\nFig. 9.12 : Powder is sprinkled on the carrom\nboard to reduce friction\nfriction in order to increase efficiency.\nWhen oil, grease or graphite is applied\nbetween the moving part of a machine,\na thin layer is formed there and moving\nsurfaces do not dir ectly rub against each\nother (Fig. 9.13). Interlocking of\nirregularities is avoided to a great extent.\nMovement becomes smooth. The\nsubstances which reduce friction are\ncalled lubricants . In some machines, it\nmay not be advisable to use oil as\nlubricant. An air cushion between the\nmoving parts is used to reduce friction.We deliberately incr ease friction by\nusing brake pads in the brake system\nof bicycles and automobiles. When you\nare riding a bicycle, the brake pads do\nnot touch the wheels. But when you\npress the brake lever , these pads arr est\nthe motion of  the rim due to friction.\nThe wheel stops moving. Y\nou might have\nseen that kabaddi  players rub their\nhands with soil for a better grip of their\nopponents. Gymnasts apply some coarse\nsubstance on their hands to increase\nfriction for better grip.(a) (b)\nFig. 9.11 : (a) Soles of shoes and (b) tyres are\ntreaded to increase friction\nFig. 9.13 : Action of lubricantSurface 1Surface 2\nLubricant\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 118\nActivity 9.4\nTake a few pencils which are\ncylindrical in shape. Place them\nparallel to each other on a table.\nPlace a thick book over it\n(Fig. 9.15). Now push the book. Y ou\nobserve the pencils rolling as the\nbook moves. Do you feel it easier to\nmove the book in this way than to\nslide it? Do you think that\nresistance to the motion of the book\nhas been reduced? Have you seen\nheavy machinary being moved by\nplacing logs under it?\n9.5 Wheels Reduce Friction\nYou must have seen attaches and other\npieces of luggage fitted with rollers. Even\na child can pull such pieces of luggage\n(Fig. 9.14). Why is it so? Let us\nfind out.Can we reduce friction to\nzero by polishing surfaces\nor using large amount of\nlubricants?\nFriction can never be\nentirely eleminated. No\nsurface is perfectly smooth.\nSome irregularities are\nalways there.\nFig. 9.15 : Motion of the book on rollers\nWhen one body r olls over the sur face\nof another body, the resistance to its\nmotion is called rolling friction . Rolling\nreduces friction. It is always easier to\nroll than to slide a body over another .\nThat is the reason it is convenient to\npull luggage fitted with rollers. Can you\nnow understand why the wheel is said\nto be one of the greatest inventions of\nmankind?\nSince the rolling friction is smaller\nthan the sliding friction , sliding is\nreplaced in most machines by rolling\nby the use of ball bearings. Common\nexamples are the use of ball bearings\nbetween hubs and the axles of ceiling\nfans and bicycles (Fig. 9.16). Fig. 9.14 : Rolling reduces friction\n2024-25\n\nFRICTION 119\n9.6 Fluid Friction\nYou know that air is very light and thin.\nYet it exerts frictional force on objects\nmoving through it. Similarly, water and\nother liquids exert force of friction when\nobjects move through them. In science,\nthe common name of gases and liquidsis fluids\n. So we can say that fluids exert\nforce of friction on objects in motion\nthrough them.\nThe frictional force exerted by fluids\nis also called drag.\nThe frictional force on an object in a\nfluid depends on its speed with respect\nto the fluid. The frictional force also\ndepends on the shape of the object and\nthe nature of the fluid.\nIt is obvious that when objects\nmove through fluids, they have to\novercome friction acting on them. In\nthis process they lose energy. Efforts\nare, therefore, made to minimise\nfriction. So, objects are given special\nshapes. Where do you think scientists\nget hints for these special shapes?\nFrom nature, of course. Birds and\nfishes have to move about in fluids\nall the time. Their bodies must have\nevolved to shapes which would make\nthem lose less energy in overcoming\nfriction. Look carefully at the shape\nof an aeroplane (Fig. 9.17). Do you\nfind any similarity in its shape and\nthat of a bird?

Now\nsuppose that we know the lengths of the sides of a scalene triangle and not the height.\nCan you still find its area? For instance, you have a triangular park whose sides are 40\nm, 32 m, and 24 m. How will you calculate its area? Definitely if you want to apply the\nformula, you will have to calculate its height. But we do not have a clue to calculate\nthe height. Try doing so. If you are not able to get it, then go to the next section.\nHeron was born in about 10AD possibly in Alexandria in\nEgypt. He worked in applied mathematics. His works on\nmathematical and physical subjects are so numerous and\nvaried that he is considered to be an encyclopedic writer\nin these fields. His geometrical works deal largely with\nproblems on mensuration written in three books. Book I\ndeals with the area of squares, rectangles, triangles,\ntrapezoids (trapezia), various other specialised\nquadrilaterals, the regular polygons, circles, surfaces of\ncylinders, cones, spheres etc. In this book, Heron has\nderived the famous formula for the area of a triangle in\nterms of its three sides.\nThe formula given by Heron about the area of a triangle, is also known as Hero’s\nformula . It is stated as:\nArea of a triangle = ( ) ( ) ( )s s a s b s c− − − (I)\nHeron (10 C.E. – 75 C.E.)\nFig. 10.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n132 MATHEMA TICS\nwher e a, b and c ar e the sides of the triangle , and s = semi-perimeter , i.e., half the\nperimeter of the triangle  = 2a b c+ +,\nThis formula is helpful where it is not possible to find the height of the triangle\neasily . Let us apply it to calculate the area of the triangular park ABC, mentioned\nabove (see Fig. 10.2).\nLet us take a = 40 m, b = 24 m, c = 32 m,\nso that we have s = 40 24 32\n2+ + m = 48 m.\ns – a = (48 – 40) m = 8 m,\ns – b = (48 – 24) m = 24 m,\ns – c = (48 – 32) m = 16 m.\nTherefore, area of the park ABC\n= ( ) ( ) ( )− − −s s a s b s c\n= 2 248 8 24 16 m 384m× × × =\nWe see that 322 + 242 = 1024 + 576 = 1600 = 402. Therefore, the sides of the park\nmake a right triangle. The largest side, i.e., BC which is 40 m will be the hypotenuse\nand the angle between the sides AB and AC will be 90°.\nWe can check that the area of the park is 1\n2 × 32 × 24 m2 = 384 m2.\nWe find that the area we have got is the same as we found by using Heron’ s\nformula.\nNow using Heron’ s formula, you verify this fact by finding the areas of other\ntriangles discussed earlier viz.,\n(i)equilateral triangle with side 10 cm.\n(ii)isosceles triangle with unequal side as 8 cm and each equal side as 5 cm.\nYou will see that\nFor (i), we have s = 10 10 10\n2+ + cm = 15 cm.Fig. 10.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\nHERON ’S FORMULA 133\nArea of triangle  = 15(15 10) (15 10) (15 10)− − −  cm2\n                         =2 215 5 5 5 cm 25 3 cm× × × =\nFor (ii), we have s = 8 5 5cm 9 cm2+ +=\nArea of triangle = 9(9 8) (9 5) (9 5)− − − cm2 = 2 29 1 4 4 cm 12 cm .× × × =\nLet us now solve some more examples:\nExample 1 :  Find the area of a triangle, two sides of which are 8 cm and 1 1 cm and\nthe perimeter is 32 cm (see Fig. 10.3).\nSolution :  Here we have perimeter of the triangle = 32 cm, a = 8 cm and b = 11 cm.\nThird side c = 32 cm – (8 + 1 1) cm = 13 cm\nSo, 2s =32, i.e., s = 16 cm,\ns – a =(16 – 8) cm = 8 cm,\ns – \nb =(16 – 1 1) cm = 5 cm,\ns – c =(16 – 13) cm = 3 cm.\nTherefore, area of the triangle = ( ) ( ) ( )s s a s b s c− − −\n=2 216 8 5 3 cm 8 30 cm× × × =\nExample 2 :  A triangular park ABC has sides 120m, 80m and 50m (see Fig. 10.4). A\ngardener Dhania  has to put a fence all around it and also plant grass inside. How\nmuch area does she need to plant? Find the cost of fencing it with barbed wire at the\nrate of `20 per metre leaving a space 3m wide for a gate on one side.\nSolution :  For finding area of the park, we have\n2s =50 m + 80 m + 120 m = 250 m.\ni.e., s =125 m\nNow,s – \na =(125 – 120) m = 5 m,\ns – b =(125 – 80) m = 45 m,\ns – c =(125 – 50) m = 75 m.Fig. 10.3\nFig. 10.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n134 MATHEMA TICS\nTherefore, area of the park  = ( ) ( ) ( )s s a s b s c− − −\n=125 5 45 75× × × m2\n=2375 15 m\nAlso, perimeter of the park =  AB + BC + CA  = 250 m\nTherefore, length of the wire needed for fencing = 250 m – 3 m (to be left for gate)\n=247 m\nAnd so the cost of fencing = `20 × 247 = `4940\nExample 3 :  The sides of a triangular plot are in the ratio of 3 : 5 : 7 and its perimeter\nis 300 m. Find its area.\nSolution :  Suppose that the sides, in metres, are 3 x, 5x and 7 x (see Fig. 10.5).\nThen, we know that 3 x + 5x + 7x = 300 (perimeter of the triangle)\nTherefore, 15 x = 300, which gives x = 20.\nSo the sides of the triangle are 3 × 20 m, 5 × 20 m and 7 × 20 m\ni.e., 60 m, 100 m and 140 m.\nCan you now find the area [Using Heron’ s formula]?\nWe have s = 60 100 140\n2+ + m = 150 m,\nand area will be 150(150 60) (150 100) (150 140)− − − m2\n=150 90 50 10× × × m2\n=21500 3 m\nEXERCISE 10.1\n1.A traffic signal board, indicating ‘ SCHOOL  AHEAD ’, is an equilateral triangle with\nside ‘ a’.

{"class": "9", "subject": "math", "chapter": "Chapter 12: statistics", "content": "STATISTICS 151\nCHAPTER 12\nSTATISTICS\n12.1 Graphical Representation of Data\nThe representation of data by tables has already been discussed. Now let us turn our\nattention to another representation of data, i.e., the graphical representation. It is well\nsaid that one picture is better than a thousand words. Usually comparisons among the\nindividual items are best shown by means of graphs. The representation then becomes\neasier to understand than the actual data. We shall study the following graphical\nrepresentations in this section.\n(A)Bar graphs\n(B)Histograms of uniform width, and of varying widths\n(C)Frequency polygons\n(A) Bar Graphs\nIn earlier classes, you have already studied and constructed bar graphs. Here we\nshall discuss them through a more formal approach. Recall that a bar graph is a\npictorial representation of data in which usually bars of uniform width are drawn with\nequal spacing between them on one axis (say , the x-axis), depicting the variable. The\nvalues of the variable are shown on the other axis (say , the y-axis) and the heights of\nthe bars depend on the values of the variable.\nExample 1 :  In a particular section of Class IX, 40 students were asked about the\nmonths of their birth and the following graph was prepared for the data so obtained:\nReprint 2025-26\n\n152 MATHEMA TICS\nFig. 12.1\nObserve the bar graph given above and answer the following questions:\n(i) How many students were born in the month of November?\n(ii) In which month were the maximum number of students born?\nSolution :  Note that the variable here is the ‘month of birth’, and the value of the\nvariable is the ‘Number of students born’.\n(i) 4 students were born in the month of November .\n(ii) The Maximum number of students were born in the month of August.\nLet us now recall how a bar graph is constructed by considering the following example.\nExample 2 :  A family with a monthly income of  ` 20,000 had planned the following\nexpenditures per month under various heads:\nTable 12.1\nHeads Expenditure\n(in thousand rupees)\nGrocery 4\nRent 5\nEducation of children 5\nMedicine 2\nFuel 2\nEntertainment 1\nMiscellaneous 1\nDraw a bar graph for the data above.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 153\nSolution :  We draw the bar graph of this data in the following steps. Note that the unit\nin the second column is thousand rupees. So, ‘4’ against ‘grocery’ means `4000.\n1.We represent the Heads (variable) on the horizontal axis choosing any scale,\nsince the width of the bar is not important. But for clarity , we take equal widths\nfor all bars and maintain equal gaps in between. Let one Head be represented by\none unit.\n2.We represent the expenditure (value) on the vertical axis. Since the maximum\nexpenditure is `5000, we can choose the scale as 1 unit = `1000.\n3.To represent our first Head, i.e., grocery , we draw a rectangular bar with width\n1 unit and height 4 units.\n4.Similarly , other Heads are represented leaving a gap of 1 unit in between two\nconsecutive bars.\nThe bar graph is drawn in Fig. 12.2.\nFig. 12.2\nHere, you can easily visualise the relative characteristics of the data at a glance, e.g.,\nthe expenditure on education is more than double that of medical expenses. Therefore,\nin some ways it serves as a better representation of data than the tabular form.\nActivity 1 :  Continuing with the same four groups of Activity 1, represent the data by\nsuitable bar graphs.\nLet us now see how a frequency distribution table for continuous  class intervals\ncan be represented graphically .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n154 MATHEMA TICS\n(B) Histogram\nThis is a form of representation like the bar graph, but it is used for continuous class\nintervals. For instance,  consider the frequency distribution Table 12.2, representing\nthe weights of 36 students of a class:\nTable 12.2\nWeights (in kg) Number of students\n30.5 - 35.5 9\n35.5 - 40.5 6\n40.5 - 45.5 15\n45.5 - 50.5 3\n50.5 - 55.5 1\n55.5 - 60.5 2\nTotal 36\nLet us represent the data given above graphically as follows:\n(i)We represent the weights on the horizontal axis on a suitable scale. We can choose\nthe scale as 1 cm = 5 kg. Also, since the first class interval is starting from 30.5\nand not zero, we show it on the graph by marking a kink or a break on the axis.\n(ii)We represent the number of students (frequency) on the vertical axis on a suitable\nscale. Since the maximum frequency is 15, we need to choose the scale to\naccomodate this maximum frequency .\n(iii)We now draw rectangles (or rectangular bars) of width equal to the class-size\nand lengths according to the frequencies of the corresponding class intervals. For\nexample, the rectangle for the class interval 30.5 - 35.5 will be of width 1 cm and\nlength 4.5 cm.\n(iv)In this way , we obtain the graph as shown in Fig. 12.3:\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 155\nFig. 12.3\nObserve that since there are no gaps in between consecutive rectangles, the resultant\ngraph appears like a solid figure. This is called a histogram , which is a graphical\nrepresentation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Also, unlike\na bar graph, the width of the bar plays a significant role in its construction.\nHere, in fact, areas of the rectangles erected are proportional to the corresponding\nfrequencies. However , since the widths of the rectangles are all equal, the lengths of\nthe rectangles are proportional to the frequencies. That is why , we draw the lengths\naccording to (iii) above.\nNow , consider a situation dif ferent from the one above.\nExample 3 :  A teacher wanted to analyse the performance of two sections of students\nin a mathematics test of 100 marks. Looking at their performances, she found that a\nfew students got under 20 marks and a few got 70 marks or above. So she decided to\ngroup them into intervals of varying sizes as follows: 0 - 20, 20 - 30, . . ., 60 - 70,\n70 - 100. Then she formed the following table:\nReprint 2025-26\n\n156 MATHEMA TICS\nTable 12.3\nMarks Number of students\n  0 - 20 7\n20 - 30 10\n30 - 40 10\n40 - 50 20\n50 - 60 20\n60 - 70 15\n     70 - above 8\nTotal 90\nA histogram for this table was prepared by a student as shown in Fig. 12.4.\nFig. 12.4\nCarefully examine this graphical representation. Do you think that it correctly represents\nthe data? No, the graph is giving us a misleading picture. As we have mentioned\nearlier , the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies in a histogram.\nEarlier this problem did not arise, because the widths of all the rectangles were equal.\nBut here, since the widths of the rectangles are varying, the histogram above does not\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 157\ngive a correct picture. For example, it shows a greater frequency in the interval\n70 - 100, than in 60 - 70, which is not the case.\nSo, we need to make certain modifications in the lengths of the rectangles so that\nthe areas are again proportional to the frequencies.\nThe steps to be followed are as given below:\n1.Select a class interval with the minimum class size. In the example above, the\nminimum class-size is 10.\n2.The lengths of the rectangles are then modified to be proportionate to the\nclass-size 10.\nFor instance, when the class-size is 20, the length of the rectangle is 7. So when\nthe class-size is 10, the length of the rectangle will be 7\n20× 10 = 3.5.\nSimilarly , proceeding in this manner , we get the following table:\nTable 12.4\nMarks Frequency Width of Length of the rectangle\nthe class\n0 - 20 7 207\n20 × 10 = 3.5\n20 - 30 10 1010\n10 × 10 = 10\n30 - 40 10 1010\n10 × 10 = 10\n40 - 50 20 1020\n10 × 10 = 20\n50 - 60 20 1020\n10 × 10 = 20\n60 - 70 15 1015\n10 × 10 = 15\n70 - 100 8 308\n30 × 10 = 2.67\nReprint 2025-26\n\n158 MATHEMA TICS\nSince we have calculated these lengths for an interval of 10 marks in each case,\nwe may call these lengths as “proportion of students per 10 marks interval”.\nSo, the correct histogram with varying width is given in Fig. 12.5.\nFig. 12.5\n(C) Frequency Polygon\nThere is yet another visual way of representing quantitative data and its frequencies.\nThis is a polygon. To see what we mean, consider the histogram represented by\nFig. 12.3. Let us join the mid-points of the upper sides of the adjacent rectangles of\nthis histogram by means of line segments. Let us call these mid-points B, C, D, E, F\nand G. When joined by line segments, we obtain the figure BCDEFG (see Fig. 12.6).\nTo complete the polygon, we assume that there is a class interval with frequency zero\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 159\nbefore 30.5 - 35.5, and one after 55.5 - 60.5, and their mid-points are A and H,\nrespectively . ABCDEFGH is the frequency polygon corresponding to the data shown\nin Fig. 12.3. We have shown this in Fig. 12.6.\nFig. 12.6\nAlthough, there exists no class preceding the lowest class and no class succeeding\nthe highest class, addition of the two class intervals with zero frequency enables us to\nmake the area of the frequency polygon the same as the area of the histogram. Why\nis this so? ( Hint :  Use the properties of congruent triangles.)\nNow , the question arises: how do we complete the polygon when there is no class\npreceding the first class? Let us consider such a situation.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n160 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 4 :  Consider the marks, out of 100, obtained by 51 students of a class in a\ntest, given in Table 12.5.\nTable 12.5\nMarks Number of students\n0 - 10 5\n10 - 20 10\n20 - 30 4\n30 - 40 6\n40 - 50 7\n50 - 60 3\n60 - 70 2\n70 - 80 2\n80 - 90 3\n90 - 100 9\nTotal 51\nDraw a frequency polygon corresponding to this frequency distribution table.\nSolution :  Let us first draw a histogram for this data and mark the mid-points of the\ntops of the rectangles as B, C, D, E, F , G, H, I, J, K, respectively . Here, the first class is\n0-10. So, to find the class preceeding 0-10, we extend the horizontal axis in the negative\ndirection and find the mid-point of the imaginary class-interval (–10) - 0. The first end\npoint, i.e., B is joined to this mid-point with zero frequency on the negative direction of\nthe horizontal axis. The point where this line segment meets the vertical axis is marked\nas A. Let L  be the mid-point of the class succeeding the last class of the given data.\nThen OABCDEFGHIJKL is the frequency polygon, which is shown in Fig. 12.7.\nFig. 12.7\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTATISTICS 161\nFrequency polygons can also be drawn independently without drawing\nhistograms.  For this, we require the mid-points of the class-intervals used in the data.\nThese mid-points of the class-intervals are called class-marks .\nTo find the class-mark of a class interval, we find the sum of the upper limit and\nlower limit of a class and divide it by 2.

You now have the\ncollection of whole numbers which is denoted by\nthe symbol W.\nNow , stretching in front of you are many , many negative integers. Put all the\nnegative integers into your bag. What is your new collection? Recall that it is the\ncollection of all integers , and it is denoted by the symbol Z.\nAre there some numbers still left on the line? Of course! There are numbers like\n1 3,\n2 4, or even 2005\n2006−.

The collection of rational numbers is denoted by Q.\n‘Rational’ comes from the word ‘ratio’, and Q comes from the word ‘quotient’.\nYou may recall the definition of rational numbers:\nA number ‘ r’ is called a rational number , if it can be written in the form p\nq,\nwhere p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. (Why do we insist that q ≠ 0?)\nNotice that all the numbers now in the bag can be written in the form p\nq, where p\nand q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, –25 can be written as 25;1− here p = –25\nand q = 1. Therefore, the rational numbers also include the natural numbers, whole\nnumbers and integers.\nYou also know that the rational numbers do not have a unique representation in\nthe form p\nq, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, 1\n2 = 2\n4 = 10\n20 = 25\n50\n= 47\n94, and so on. These are equivalent rational numbers (or fractions ). However ,\nwhen we say that p\nq is a rational number , or when we represent p\nq on the number\nline, we assume that q ≠ 0 and that  p and q have no common factors other than 1\n(that is, p and q are co-prime ). So, on the number line, among the infinitely many\nfractions equivalent to 1\n2, we will choose 1\n2 to represent all of them.\nNow , let us solve some examples about the dif ferent types of numbers, which you\nhave studied in earlier classes.\nExample 1 :  Are the following statements true or false? Give reasons for your answers.\n(i)Every whole number is a natural number .\n(ii)Every integer is a rational number .\n(iii)Every rational number is an integer .\nSolution :  (i)False, because zero is a whole number but not a natural number .\n(ii)True, because every integer m can be expressed in the form 1m, and so it is a\nrational number .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n4 MATHEMA TICS\n(iii)False, because 3\n5 is not an integer .\nExample 2 :  Find five rational numbers between 1 and 2.\nWe can approach this problem in at least two ways.\nSolution 1 :  Recall that to find a rational number between r and s, you can add r and\ns and divide the sum by 2, that is 2r s+ lies between r and s. So, 3\n2 is a number\nbetween 1 and 2. You can proceed in this manner to find four more rational numbers\nbetween 1 and 2. These four numbers are 5 11 13 7. , , and4 8 8 4\nSolution 2 :  The other option is to find all the five rational numbers in one step. Since\nwe want five numbers, we write 1 and 2 as rational numbers with denominator 5 + 1,\ni.e., 1 = 6\n6 and 2 = 12\n6. Then you can check that 7\n6, 8\n6, 9\n6, 10\n6 and 11\n6 are all rational\nnumbers between 1 and 2. So, the five numbers are 7 4 3 5 11,, , and6 3 2 3 6.\nRemark :  Notice that in Example 2, you were asked to find five rational numbers\nbetween 1 and 2. But, you must have realised that in fact there are infinitely many\nrational numbers between 1 and 2. In general, there are infinitely many rational\nnumbers between any two given rational numbers .\nLet us take a look at the number line again. Have you picked up all the numbers?\nNot, yet. The fact is that there are infinitely many more numbers left on the number\nline! There are gaps in between the places of the numbers you picked up, and not just\none or two but infinitely many . The amazing thing is that there are infinitely many\nnumbers lying between any two of these gaps too!\nSo we are left with the following questions:\n1.What are the numbers, that are left on the number\nline, called?\n2.How do we recognise them? That is, how do we\ndistinguish them from the rationals (rational\nnumbers)?\nThese questions will be answered in the next section.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 5\nEXERCISE 1.1\n1.Is zero a rational number?

Give reasons for your answers.\n(i)Every natural number is a whole number .\n(ii)Every integer is a whole number .\n(iii)Every rational number is a whole number .\n1.2 Irrational Numbers\nWe saw , in the previous section, that there may be numbers on the number line that\nare not rationals. In this section, we are going to investigate these numbers. So far , all\nthe numbers you have come across, are of the form p\nq, where p and q are integers\nand q ≠ 0. So, you may ask: are there numbers which are not of this form? There are\nindeed such numbers.\nThe Pythagoreans in Greece, followers of the famous\nmathematician and philosopher Pythagoras, were the first\nto discover the numbers which were not rationals, around\n400 BC. These numbers are called irrational numbers\n(irrationals ), because they cannot be written in the form of\na ratio of integers. There are many myths surrounding the\ndiscovery of irrational numbers by the Pythagorean,\nHippacus of Croton. In all the myths, Hippacus has an\nunfortunate end, either for discovering that 2 is irrational\nor for disclosing the secret about 2 to people outside the\nsecret Pythagorean sect!\n Let us formally define these numbers.\nA number ‘s’ is called irrational, if it cannot be written in the form p\nq, where p\nand q are integers and q ≠ 0.Pythagoras\n(569 BCE – 479 BCE)\nFig. 1.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n6 MATHEMA TICS\n200520063\n–516\n60999\n4\n–8–662558\n0\n277117\n981\n–12\n13\n89\n–672\n39\n14\n-65\n–66\n26\n-45036\n19R\nYou already know that there are infinitely many rationals. It turns out that there\nare infinitely many irrational numbers too. Some examples are:\n2, 3, 15, , π, 0.101 10111011110...\nRemark :  Recall that when we use the symbol , we assume that it is the\npositive square root of the number . So 4 = 2, though both 2 and –2 are square\nroots of 4.\nSome of the irrational numbers listed above are familiar to you. For example, you\nhave already come across many of the square roots listed above and the number π.\nThe Pythagoreans proved that 2 is irrational. Later in approximately 425 BC,\nTheodorus of Cyrene showed that 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13,  14, 15\nand 17 are also irrationals. Proofs of irrationality of 2, 3, 5, etc., shall be\ndiscussed in Class X.  As to π, it was known to various cultures for thousands of\nyears, it was proved to be irrational by Lambert and Legendre only in the late 1700s.\nIn the next section, we will discuss why 0.101 10111011110... and π are irrational.\nLet us return to the questions raised at the end of\nthe previous section. Remember the bag of rational\nnumbers. If we now put all irrational numbers into\nthe bag, will there be any number left on the number\nline? The answer is no! It turns out that the collection\nof all rational numbers and irrational numbers together\nmake up what we call the collection of real numbers ,\nwhich is denoted by R. Therefore, a real number is either rational or irrational. So, we\ncan say that every real number is represented by a unique point on the number\nline. Also, ever y point on the number  line r epresents a unique r eal number .\nThis is why we call the number line, the real number line .\nIn the 1870s two German mathematicians,\nCantor and Dedekind, showed that :\nCorresponding to every real number , there is a\npoint on the real number line, and corresponding\nto every point on the number line, there exists a\nunique real number .\nG. Cantor  (1845-1918)\nFig. 1.5R. Dedekind (1831-1916)\nFig. 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 7\nLet us see how we can locate some of the irrational numbers on the number line.\nExample 3 :  Locate 2 on the number line.\nSolution :  It is easy to see how the Greeks might have discovered\n2. Consider a square OABC, with each side 1 unit in length (see\nFig. 1.6). Then you can see by the Pythagoras theorem that\nOB = 2 21 1 2+ = . How do we represent 2 on the number line?\nThis is easy . Transfer Fig. 1.6 onto the number line making sure that the vertex O\ncoincides with zero (see Fig. 1.7).\nFig. 1.7\nWe have just seen that OB = 2. Using a compass with centre O and radius OB,\ndraw an arc intersecting the number line at the point P . Then P  corresponds to 2 on\nthe number line.\nExample 4 :  Locate 3 on the number line.\nSolution :  Let us return to Fig. 1.7.\nFig. 1.8\nConstruct BD of unit length perpendicular to OB (as in Fig. 1.8). Then using the\nPythagoras theorem, we see that OD = ( )222 1 3+ = . Using a compass, with\ncentre O and radius OD, draw an arc which intersects the number line at the point Q.\nThen Q corresponds to 3.Fig. 1.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8 MATHEMA TICS\nIn the same way , you can locate n for any positive integer n, after 1n− has been\nlocated.\nEXERCISE 1.2\n1.State whether the following statements are true or false.

We will look at the decimal expansions of real numbers and see if we\ncan use the expansions to distinguish between rationals and irrationals. We will also\nexplain how to visualise the representation of real numbers on the number line using\ntheir decimal expansions. Since rationals are more familiar to us, let us start with\nthem. Let us take three examples : 10 7 1, ,3 8 7.\nPay special attention to the remainders and see if you can find any pattern.Fig. 1.9 : Constructing\nsquare root spiral\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 9\nExample 5 :  Find the decimal expansions of 10\n3, 7\n8 and 1\n7.\nSolution :\n    3.333...     0.875       0.142857...\n310 87.0 71.0\n     9     64         7\n     10       60         30\n      9       56         28\n     10         40           20\n       9         40           14\n       10          0             60\n         9             56\n         1              40\n             35\n               50\n               49\n       1\nRemainders : 1, 1, 1, 1, 1...

You should have noticed at least three things:\n(i) The remainders either become 0 after a certain stage, or start repeating themselves.\n(ii) The number of entries in the repeating string of remainders is less than the divisor\n(in 10\n3 one number repeats itself and the divisor is 3, in 1\n7 there are six entries\n326451 in the repeating string of remainders and 7 is the divisor).\n(iii) If the remainders repeat, then we get a repeating block of digits in the quotient\n(for 10\n3, 3 repeats in the quotient and for 1\n7, we get the repeating block 142857\nin the quotient).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n10 MATHEMA TICS\nAlthough we have noticed this pattern using only the examples above, it is true for all\nrationals of the form p\nq (q ≠ 0). On division of p by q, two main things happen – either\nthe remainder becomes zero or never becomes zero and we get a repeating string of\nremainders. Let us look at each case separately .\nCase (i) :  The remainder becomes zero\nIn the example of 7\n8, we found that the remainder becomes zero after some steps and\nthe decimal expansion of 7\n8 = 0.875. Other examples are 1\n2 = 0.5, 639\n250 = 2.556. In all\nthese cases, the decimal expansion terminates or ends after a finite number of steps.\nWe call the decimal expansion of such numbers terminating .\nCase (ii) :  The remainder never becomes zero\nIn the examples of 10\n3 and 1\n7, we notice that the remainders repeat after a certain\nstage forcing the decimal expansion to go on for ever . In other words, we have a\nrepeating block of digits in the quotient. We say that this expansion is non-terminating\nrecurring. For example, 10\n3 = 3.3333... and 1\n7 = 0.142857142857142857...\nThe usual way of showing that 3 repeats in the quotient of 10\n3 is to write it as 3.3.\nSimilarly , since the block of digits 142857 repeats in the quotient of 1\n7, we write 1\n7 as\n0. 142857 , where the bar above the digits indicates the block of digits that repeats.\nAlso 3.57272... can be written as 3.572 . So, all these examples give us non-terminating\nrecurring (repeating ) decimal expansions.\nThus, we see that the decimal expansion of rational numbers have only two choices:\neither they are terminating or non-terminating recurring.\nNow suppose, on the other hand, on your walk on the number line, you come across a\nnumber like 3.142678 whose decimal expansion is terminating or a number like\n1.272727... that is, 1.27 , whose decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring, can\nyou conclude that it is a rational number? The answer is yes!\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 11\nWe will not prove it but illustrate this fact with a few examples. The terminating cases\nare easy .\nExample 6 :  Show that 3.142678 is a rational number . In other words, express 3.142678\nin the form p\nq, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\nSolution :  We have 3.142678 = 3142678\n1000000, and hence is a rational number .\nNow , let us consider the case when the decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring.\nExample 7 :  Show that 0.3333... = 0 3. can be expressed in the form p\nq, where p and\nq are integers and q ≠ 0.\nSolution :  Since we do not know what 0 3. is , let us call it ‘ x’ and so\nx =0.3333...\nNow here is where the trick comes in. Look at\n10 x =10 × (0.333...) = 3.333...\nNow, 3.3333... = 3 + x, since x = 0.3333...\nTherefore, 10 x =3 + x\nSolving for x, we get\n9x =3, i.e., x = 1\n3\nExample 8 :  Show that 1.272727... = 1 27. can be expressed in the form p\nq, where p\nand q are integers and q ≠ 0.\nSolution :  Let x = 1.272727... Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 100 to\nget\n100 x =127.2727...\nSo, 100 x =126 + 1.272727... = 126 + x\nTherefore, 100 x – x =126, i.e., 99 x = 126\nReprint 2025-26\n\n12 MATHEMA TICS\ni.e., x =126 14\n99 11=\nYou can check the reverse that 14\n11 = 1 27..\nExample 9 :  Show that 0.2353535... = 0 235.  can be expressed in the form p\nq,\nwhere p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\nSolution :  Let x  = 0 235. . Over here, note that 2 does not repeat, but the block 35\nrepeats. Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 100 to get\n100 x =23.53535...\nSo, 100 x =23.3 + 0.23535... = 23.3 + x\nTherefore, 99 x =23.3\ni.e., 99 x =233\n10, which gives x = 233\n990\nYou can also check the reverse that 233\n990 = 0 235. .\nSo, every number with a non-terminating recurring decimal expansion can be expressed\nin the form p\nq (q ≠ 0), where p and q are integers. Let us summarise our results in the\nfollowing form :\nThe decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non-\nterminating r ecur ring. Mor eover , a number whose decimal expansion is\nterminating or non-terminating r ecurring is rational.\nSo, now we know what the decimal expansion of a rational number can be. What\nabout the decimal expansion of irrational numbers? Because of the property above,\nwe can conclude that their decimal expansions are non-terminating non-r ecurring.\nSo, the property for irrational numbers, similar to the property stated above for rational\nnumbers, is\nThe decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-r ecurring.\nMoreover , a number whose decimal expansion is non-terminating non-r ecurring\nis irrational.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 13\nRecall s = 0.101 10111011110... from the previous section. Notice that it is non-\nterminating and non-recurring. Therefore, from the property above, it is irrational.\nMoreover , notice that you can generate infinitely many irrationals similar to s.\nWhat about the famous irrationals 2 and π? Here are their decimal expansions up\nto a certain stage.\n2 = 1.4142135623730950488016887242096...\n   π = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950...\n(Note that, we often take 22\n7 as an approximate value for π, but π ≠ 22\n7.)\nOver the years, mathematicians have developed various techniques to produce more\nand more digits in the decimal expansions of irrational numbers. For example, you\nmight have learnt to find digits in the decimal expansion of 2 by the division method.\nInterestingly , in the Sulbasutras (rules of chord), a mathematical treatise of the Vedic\nperiod (800 BC - 500 BC), you find an approximation of 2 as follows:\n2 = 1 1 1 1 1 11 1 41421563 4 3 34 4 3.   + + × − × × =       \nNotice that it is the same as the one given above for the first five decimal places. The\nhistory of the hunt for digits in the decimal expansion of π is very interesting.\nThe Greek genius Archimedes was the first to compute\ndigits in the decimal expansion of π. He showed 3.140845\n< π < 3.142857. Aryabhatta (476 – 550 C.E.), the great\nIndian mathematician and astronomer , found the value\nof π correct to four decimal places (3.1416). Using high\nspeed computers and advanced algorithms, π has been\ncomputed to over 1.24 trillion decimal places!\nNow , let us see how to obtain irrational numbers.\nExample 10 :  Find an irrational number between 1\n7 and 2\n7.\nSolution :  We saw that 1\n7 = 0142857. . So, you can easily calculate 20 2857147.= .\nTo find an irrational number between 1\n7 and 2\n7, we find a number which isArchimedes (287 BCE – 212 BCE)\nFig. 1.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\n14 MATHEMA TICS\nnon-terminating non-recurring lying between them. Of course, you can find infinitely\nmany such numbers.\nAn example of such a number is 0.150150015000150000...\nEXERCISE 1.3\n1.Write the following in decimal form and say what kind of decimal expansion each\nhas :\n(i)36\n100(ii)1\n11(iii)148\n(iv)3\n13(v)2\n11(vi)329\n400\n2.You know that 1\n7 = 0142857. .

Moreover , if we add,\nsubtract, multiply or divide (except by zero) two rational numbers, we still get a rational\nnumber (that is, rational numbers are ‘closed’ with respect to addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication and division). It turns out that irrational numbers also satisfy the\ncommutative, associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. However ,\nthe sum, difference, quotients and products of irrational numbers are not always\nirrational. For example, ()() 6 6+ − ,()()()() 2 2 3 3 , − ⋅  and 17\n17 are\nrationals.\nLet us look at what happens when we add and multiply a rational number with an\nirrational number . For example, 3 is irrational. What about 2 3+  and 2 3 ? Since\n3 has a non-terminating  non-recurring decimal expansion, the same is true for\n2 3+  and 2 3 . Therefore, both 2 3+  and 2 3  are also irrational numbers.\nExample 1 1 : Check whether 7 5 , 72 21 2\n5, , + π −  are irrational numbers or\nnot.\nSolution :  5 = 2.236... , 2 = 1.4142..., π = 3.1415...\nThen 7 5  = 15.652..., 7\n5 = 7 5 7 5\n5 5 5=  = 3.1304...\n2 + 21 = 22.4142..., π – 2 = 1.1415...\nAll these are non-terminating non-recurring decimals. So, all these are irrational numbers.\nNow , let us see what generally happens if we add, subtract, multiply , divide, take\nsquare roots and even nth roots of these irrational numbers, where n is any natural\nnumber . Let us look at some examples.\nExample 12 :  Add 2 2 5 3 +  and 2 3 3– .\nSolution :  ( )( ) 2 2 5 3 2 3 3 – + +  = ( )( ) 2 2 2 5 3 3 3 – + +\n                 = (2 + 1) 2 (5 3) 3 3 2 2 3 + − = +\nReprint 2025-26\n\n16 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 13 :  Multiply 6 5  by 2 5 .\nSolution :  6 5  × 2 5  = 6 × 2 × 5 × 5 = 12 × 5 = 60\nExample 14 :  Divide 8 15  by 2 3 .\nSolution :  8 3 58 15 2 3 4 5\n2 3×÷ = =\nThese examples may lead you to expect the following facts, which are true :\n(i)The sum or difference of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.\n(ii)The product or quotient of a non-zero rational number with an irrational number is\nirrational.\n(iii)If we add, subtract, multiply or divide two irrationals, the result may be rational or\nirrational.\nWe now turn our attention to the operation of taking square roots of real numbers.\nRecall that, if a is a natural number , then a b= means b2 = a and b > 0. The same\ndefinition can be extended for positive real numbers.\nLet a > 0 be a real number . Then a = b means b2 = a and b > 0.\nIn Section 1.2, we saw how to represent n for any positive integer n on the number\nline. We now show how to find x for any given positive real number x geometrically .\nFor example, let us find it for x = 3.5, i.e., we find 3 5. geometrically .\nFig. 1.1 1\nMark the distance 3.5 units from a fixed point A on a given line to obtain a point B such\nthat AB = 3.5 units (see Fig. 1.1 1). From B, mark a distance of 1 unit and mark the\nnew point as C. Find the mid-point of AC and mark that point as O. Draw a semicircle\nwith centre O and radius OC. Draw a line perpendicular to AC passing through B and\nintersecting the semicircle at D. Then, BD = 3.5.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 17\nMore generally , to find x, for any positive real\nnumber x, we mark B so that AB = x units, and, as in\nFig. 1.12, mark C so that BC = 1 unit. Then, as we\nhave done for the case x = 3.5, we find BD = x\n(see Fig. 1.12). We can prove this result using the\nPythagoras Theorem.\nNotice that, in Fig. 1.12, ∆ OBD is a right-angled triangle. Also, the radius of the circle\nis 1\n2x+ units.\nTherefore, OC = OD = OA = 1\n2x+ units.\nNow , OB = 1 1\n2 2x xx+ − − = ⋅  \nSo, by the Pythagoras Theorem, we have\nBD2 = OD2 – OB2 = 2 21 1 4\n2 2 4x x xx+ −   − = =       .\nThis shows that BD = x.\nThis construction gives us a visual, and geometric way of showing that x exists for\nall real numbers x > 0. If you want to know the position of x on the number line,\nthen let us treat the line BC as the number line, with B as zero, C as 1, and so on.\nDraw an arc with centre B and radius BD, which intersects the number line in E\n(see Fig. 1.13). Then, E represents x.\nFig. 1.13Fig. 1.12\nReprint 2025-26\n\n18 MATHEMA TICS\nWe would like to now extend the idea of square roots to cube roots, fourth roots,\nand in general nth roots, where n is a positive integer . Recall your understanding of\nsquare roots and cube roots from earlier classes.\nWhat is 38? Well, we know it has to be some positive number whose cube is 8, and\nyou must have guessed 38 = 2. Let us try 5243. Do you know some number b such\nthat b5 = 243? The answer is 3. Therefore, 5243 = 3.\nFrom these examples, can you define na for a real number a > 0 and a positive\ninteger n?\nLet a > 0 be a real number and n be a positive integer . Then na = b, if bn = a and\nb > \n0. Note that the symbol ‘ ’ used in 32, 8,na, etc. is called the radical sign .\nWe now list some identities relating to square roots, which are useful in various\nways. You are already familiar with some of these from your earlier classes. The\nremaining ones follow from the distributive law of multiplication over addition of real\nnumbers, and from the identity ( x + y) (x – y) = x2 – y2, for any real numbers x and y.\nLet a and b be positive real numbers.

Look at 1\n2⋅ Can you tell\nwhere it shows up on the number line? You know that it is irrational. May be it is easier\nto handle if the denominator is a rational number . Let us see, if we can ‘rationalise’  the\ndenominator , that is, to make the denominator into a rational number . To do so, we\nneed the identities involving square roots. Let us see how .\nExample 16 :  Rationalise the denominator of 1\n2⋅\nSolution :  We want to write 1\n2 as an equivalent expression in which the denominator\nis a rational number . We know that 2.2 is rational. We also know that multiplying\n1\n2 by 2\n2 will give us an equivalent expression, since 2\n2 = 1. So, we put these two\nfacts together to get\n1 1 2 2\n2 2 2 2= × = ⋅\nIn this form, it is easy to locate 1\n2 on the number line.

You also have studied how to factorise some algebraic\nexpressions. You may recall the algebraic identities :\n(x + y)2 =x2 + 2xy + y2\n(x – y)2 =x2 – 2xy + y2\nand x2 – y2 =(x + y) (x – y)\nand their use in factorisation. In this chapter , we shall start our study with a particular\ntype of algebraic expression, called polynomial,  and the terminology related to it. We\nshall also study the Remainder Theor em and Factor Theor em and their use in the\nfactorisation of polynomials. In addition to the above, we shall study some more algebraic\nidentities and their use in factorisation and in evaluating some given expressions.\n2.2 Polynomials in One Variable\nLet us begin by recalling that a variable is denoted by a symbol that can take any real\nvalue. We use the letters x, y, z, etc. to denote variables. Notice that 2 x, 3x, – x, –1\n2x\nare algebraic expressions. All these expressions are of the form (a constant) × x. Now\nsuppose we want to write an expression which is (a constant) × (a variable) and we do\nnot know what the constant is. In such cases, we write the constant as a, b, c, etc. So\nthe expression will be ax , say.\nHowever , there is a dif ference between a letter denoting a constant and a letter\ndenoting a variable. The values of the constants remain the same throughout a particular\nsituation, that is, the values of the constants do not change in a given problem, but the\nvalue of a variable can keep changing.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n26 MATHEMA TICS\nNow , consider a square of side 3 units (see Fig. 2.1).\nWhat is its perimeter?  You know that the perimeter of a square\nis the sum of the lengths of its four sides. Here, each side is\n3 units. So, its perimeter is 4 × 3, i.e., 12 units. What will be the\nperimeter if each side of the square is 10 units? The perimeter\nis 4 × 10, i.e., 40 units. In case the length of each side is x\nunits (see Fig. 2.2), the perimeter is given by 4 x units. So, as\nthe length of the side varies, the perimeter varies.\nCan you find the area of the square PQRS? It is\nx × x = x2 square units. x2 is an algebraic expression. You are\nalso familiar with other algebraic expressions like\n2x, x2 + 2x,x3 – x2 + 4x + 7. Note that, all the algebraic\nexpressions we have considered so far have only whole\nnumbers as the exponents of the variable. Expressions of this\nform are called polynomials in one variable . In the examples\nabove, the variable is x. For instance, x3 – x2 + 4x + 7 is a\npolynomial in x. Similarly , 3y2 + 5y is a polynomial in the\nvariable y and t2 + 4 is a polynomial in the variable t.\nIn the polynomial x2 + 2x, the expressions x2 and 2 x are called the terms  of the\npolynomial. Similarly , the polynomial 3 y2 + 5y + 7 has three terms, namely , 3y2, 5y and\n7. Can you write the terms of the polynomial – x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2 ? This polynomial has\n4 terms, namely , –x3, 4x2, 7x and –2.\nEach term of a polynomial has a coefficient . So, in – x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2, the\ncoefficient of x3 is –1, the coefficient of x2 is 4, the coefficient of x is 7 and –2 is the\ncoefficient of x0 (Remember , x0 = 1). Do you know the coef ficient of x in x2 – x + 7?\nIt is –1.\n2 is also a polynomial. In fact, 2, –5, 7, etc. are examples of constant polynomials .\nThe constant polynomial 0 is called the zero polynomial\n. This plays a very important\nrole in the collection of all polynomials, as you will see in the higher classes.\nNow , consider algebraic expressions such as x + 2 31, 3 and .+ +x y yx Do you\nknow that you can write x + 1\nx = x + x–1? Here, the exponent of the second term, i.e.,\nx–1 is –1, which is not a whole number . So, this algebraic expression is not a polynomial.\nAgain, 3x+ can be written as 1\n23 x+. Here the exponent of x is 1\n2, which is\nnot a whole number . So, is 3x+ a polynomial? No, it is not. What about\n3y + y2? It is also not a polynomial (Why?).Fig. 2.1\nFig. 2.233 33\nxx xxS R\nP Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 27\nIf the variable in a polynomial is x, we may denote the polynomial by p(x), or q(x),\nor r(x), etc. So, for example, we may write :\np(x) =2x2 + 5x – 3\nq(x) =x3 –1\nr(y) =y3 + y + 1\ns(u) =2 – u – u2 + 6u5\nA polynomial can have any (finite) number of terms. For instance, x150 + x149 + ...\n+ x2 + x + 1 is a polynomial with 151 terms.\nConsider the polynomials 2 x, 2, 5 x3, –5x2, y and u4. Do you see that each of these\npolynomials has only one term? Polynomials having only one term are called monomials\n(‘mono’ means ‘one’).\nNow observe each of the following polynomials:\np(x) = x + 1, q(x) = x2 – x, r(y) = y9 + 1, t(u) = u15 – u2\nHow many terms are there in each of these? Each of these polynomials has only\ntwo terms. Polynomials having only two terms are called binomials  (‘bi’ means ‘two’).\nSimilarly , polynomials having only three terms are called trinomials\n(‘tri’ means ‘three’). Some examples of trinomials are\np(x) = x + x2 + π, q(x) = 2 + x – x2,\nr(u) = u + u2 – 2, t(y) = y4 + y + 5.\nNow , look at the polynomial p(x) = 3 x7 – 4x6 + x + 9. What is the term with the\nhighest power of x ? It is 3 x7. The exponent of x in this term is 7. Similarly , in the\npolynomial q(y) = 5 y6 – 4y2 – 6, the term with the highest power of y is 5y6 and the\nexponent of y in this term is 6. We call the highest power of the variable in a polynomial\nas the degree of the polynomial . So, the degree of the polynomial 3 x7 – 4x6 + x + 9\nis 7 and the degree of the polynomial 5 y6 – 4y2 – 6 is 6. The degree of a non-zero\nconstant polynomial is zero .\nExample 1 :  Find the degree of each of the polynomials given below:\n(i)x5 – x4 + 3 (ii) 2 – y2 – y3 + 2y8(iii) 2\nSolution :  (i) The highest power of the variable is 5. So, the degree of the polynomial\nis 5.\n(ii)The highest power of the variable is 8. So, the degree of the polynomial is 8.\n(iii)The only term here is 2 which can be written as 2 x0. So the exponent of x is 0.\nTherefore, the degree of the polynomial is 0.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n28 MATHEMA TICS\nNow observe the polynomials p (x) = 4 x + 5, q(y) = 2 y, r(t) = t + 2and\ns(u) = 3 – u. Do you see anything common among all of them? The degree of each of\nthese polynomials is one. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial .\nSome more linear polynomials in one variable are 2 x – 1, 2y + 1, 2 – u . Now , try and\nfind a linear polynomial in x with 3 terms? You would not be able to find it because a\nlinear polynomial in x can have at most two terms. So, any linear polynomial in x will\nbe of the form ax + b, where a and b are constants and a ≠ 0 (why?). Similarly ,\nay + b is a linear polynomial in y.\nNow consider the polynomials :\n2x2 + 5, 5x2 + 3x + π,x2 and x2 + 2\n5x\nDo you agree that they are all of degree two? A polynomial of degree two is called\na quadratic polynomial. Some examples of a quadratic polynomial are 5 – y2,\n4y + 5y2 and 6 – y – y2. Can you write a quadratic polynomial in one variable with four\ndifferent terms? You will find that a quadratic polynomial in one variable will have at\nmost 3 terms. If you list a few more quadratic polynomials, you will find that any\nquadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are\nconstants. Similarly , quadratic polynomial in y will be of the form ay2 + by + c, provided\na ≠ 0 and a, b, \nc are constants.\nWe call a polynomial of degree three a cubic polynomial . Some examples of a\ncubic polynomial in x are 4 x3, 2x3 + 1, 5 x3 + x2, 6x3 – x, 6 – x3, 2x3 + 4x2 + 6x + 7. How\nmany terms do you think a cubic polynomial in one variable can have? It can have at\nmost 4 terms. These may be written in the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, where a ≠ 0 and\na, b, c and d are constants.\nNow , that you have seen what a polynomial of degree 1, degree 2, or degree 3\nlooks like, can you write down a polynomial in one variable of degree n for any natural\nnumber n? A polynomial in one variable x of degree n is an expression of the form\n anxn + an–1xn–1 + . . . + a1x + a0\nwhere a0, a1, a2, . . ., an are constants and an ≠ 0.\nIn particular , if a0 = a1 = a2 = a3 = . . . = an = 0 (all the constants are zero), we get\nthe zero polynomial , which is denoted by 0. What is the degree of the zero polynomial?\nThe degree of the zero polynomial is not defined .\nSo far we have dealt with polynomials in one variable only . We can also have\npolynomials in more than one variable. For example, x2 + y2 + xyz (where variables\nare x, y and z) is a polynomial in three variables. Similarly p2 + q10 + r (where the\nvariables are p, q and r), u3 + v2 (where the variables are u and v) are polynomials in\nthree and two variables, respectively . You will be studying such polynomials in detail\nlater.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 29\nEXERCISE 2.1\n1.Which of the following expressions are polynomials in one variable and which are\nnot?

Note that :  p(1) = 1 – 1 = 0.\nAs p(1) = 0, we say that 1 is a zero of the polynomial p(x).\nSimilarly , you can check that 2 is a zero of q(x), where q(x) = x – 2.\nIn general, we say that a zero of a polynomial p(x) is a number c such that p(c) = 0.\nYou must have observed that the zero of the polynomial x – 1 is obtained by\nequating it to 0, i.e., x – 1 = 0, which gives x = 1. We say p(x) = 0 is a polynomial\nequation and 1 is the root of the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. So we say 1 is the zero\nof the polynomial x – 1, or a root of the polynomial equation x – 1 = 0.\nNow , consider the constant polynomial 5. Can you tell what its zero is? It has no\nzero because replacing x by any number in 5 x0 still gives us 5. In fact, a non-zer o\nconstant polynomial has no zer o. What about the zeroes of the zero polynomial? By\nconvention,  ever y real number is a zer o of the zer o polynomial .\nExample 3 :  Check whether –2 and 2 are zeroes of the polynomial x + 2.\nSolution :  Letp(x) = x + 2.\nThen p(2) = 2 + 2 = 4, p(–2) = –2 + 2 = 0\nTherefore, –2 is a zero of the polynomial x + 2, but 2 is not.\nExample 4 :  Find a zero of the polynomial p(x) = 2 x + 1.\nSolution :  Finding a zero of p(x), is the same as solving the equation\np(x) =0\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 31\nNow, 2x + 1 = 0 gives us x = 1–2\nSo, 1–2 is a zero of the polynomial 2 x + 1.\nNow , if p(x) = ax  + b, a ≠ 0, is a linear polynomial, how can we find a zero of\np(x)? Example 4 may have given you some idea. Finding a zero of the polynomial p(x),\namounts to solving the polynomial equation p(x) = 0.\nNow , p(x) = 0 means ax + b =0, a ≠ 0\nSo, ax =–b\ni.e., x =–b\na.\nSo, x = b\na− is the only zero of p(x), i.e., a linear polynomial has one and only one zer o.\nNow we can say that 1 is the zero of x – 1, and –2 is the zero of x + 2.\nExample 5 :  Verify whether 2 and 0 are zeroes of the polynomial x2 – 2x.\nSolution :  Let p(x) =x2 – 2x\nThen p(2) = 22 – 4 = 4 – 4 = 0\nand p(0) = 0 – 0 = 0\nHence, 2 and 0 are both zeroes of the polynomial x2 – 2x.\nLet us now list our observations:\n(i)A zero of a polynomial need not be 0.\n(ii)0 may be a zero of a polynomial.\n(iii) Every linear polynomial has one and only one zero.\n(iv) A polynomial can have more than one zero.\nEXERCISE 2.2\n1.Find the value of the polynomial 5 x – 4x2 + 3 at\n(i)x = 0 (ii)x = –1 (iii)x = 2\n2.Find p(0), p(1) and p(2) for each of the following polynomials:\n(i)p(y) = y2 – y + 1 (ii)p(t) = 2 + t + 2t2 – t3\n(iii)p(x) = x3(iv)p(x) = (x – 1) ( x + 1)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n32 MATHEMA TICS\n3.Verify whether the following are zeroes of the polynomial, indicated against them.\n(i)p(x) = 3x + 1, x = 1–3(ii)p(x) = 5x – π,x = 4\n5\n(iii)p(x) = x2 – 1, x = 1, –1 (iv)p(x) = (x  + 1) ( x – 2), x = – 1, 2\n(v)p(x) = x2,x = 0 (vi)p(x) = lx + m,x = –m\nl\n(vii)p(x) = 3x2 – 1, x = 1 2,\n3 3− (viii) p(x) = 2x + 1, x = 1\n2\n4.Find the zero of the polynomial in each of the following cases:\n(i)p(x) = x + 5 (ii)p(x) = x – 5 (iii)p(x) = 2x + 5\n(iv)p(x) = 3x – 2 (v)p(x) = 3x (vi)p(x) = ax, a ≠ 0\n(vii)p(x) = cx + d, c ≠ 0, c, d are real numbers.\n2.4 Factorisation of Polynomials\nLet us now look at the situation of Example 10 above more closely . It tells us that since\nthe remainder , 1\n2q −   = 0, (2 t + 1) is a factor of q(t), i.e., q(t) = (2 t + 1) g(t)\nfor some polynomial g(t). This is a particular case of the following theorem.\nFactor  Theor em :  If p(x) is a polynomial of degree n > 1 and a is any real number ,\nthen (i) x – a is a factor of p(x), if p(a) = 0, and (ii) p(a) = 0, if x – a is a factor of p(x).\nProof:  By the Remainder Theorem, p(x)=(x – a) q(x) + p(a).\n(i)If p(a) = 0, then p(x) = (x – a) q(x), which shows that x – a is a factor of p(x).\n(ii)Since x – a  is a factor of p(x), p(x) = (x – a) g(x) for same polynomial g(x).\nIn this case, p(a) = (a – a) g(a) = 0.\nExample 6 :  Examine whether x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6 and of 2 x + 4.\nSolution :  The zero of x + 2 is –2. Let p(x) = x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6 and s(x) = 2 x + 4\nThen, p(–2) = (–2)3 + 3(–2)2 + 5(–2) + 6\n=–8 + 12 – 10 + 6\n=0\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 33\nSo, by the Factor Theorem, x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6.\nAgain, s(–2) = 2(–2) + 4 = 0\nSo, x + 2 is a factor of 2 x + 4. In fact, you can check this without applying the Factor\nTheorem, since 2 x + 4 = 2( x + 2).\nExample 7 :  Find the value of k, if x – 1 is a factor of 4 x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k.\nSolution :  As x – 1 is a factor of p(x) = 4 x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k, p(1) = 0\nNow, p(1) = 4(1)3 + 3(1)2 – 4(1) + k\nSo, 4 + 3 – 4 + k =0\ni.e., k =–3\nWe will now use the Factor Theorem to factorise some polynomials of degree 2 and 3.\nYou are already familiar with the factorisation of a quadratic polynomial like\nx2 + lx + m. You had factorised it by splitting the middle term lx as ax + bx so that\nab = m. Then x2 + lx + m = (x + a) (x + b). We shall now try to factorise quadratic\npolynomials of the type ax2 + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are constants.\nFactorisation of the polynomial ax2 + bx + c by splitting the middle term  is as\nfollows:\nLet its factors be ( px + q) and ( rx + s). Then\nax2 + bx + c = (px + q) (rx + s) = pr x2 + (ps + qr) x + qs\nComparing the coef ficients of x2, we get a = pr.\nSimilarly , comparing the coef ficients of x, we get b = ps + qr.\nAnd, on comparing the constant terms, we get c = \nqs.\nThis shows us that b is the sum of two numbers ps and qr, whose product is\n(ps)(qr) = ( pr)(qs) = ac.\nTherefore, to factorise ax2 + bx + c, we have to write b as the sum of two\nnumbers whose product is ac. This will be clear from Example 13.\nExample 8 :  Factorise 6 x2 + 17 x + 5 by splitting the middle term, and by using the\nFactor Theorem.\nSolution 1 : (By splitting method)  : If we can find two numbers p and q such that\np + q = 17 and pq = 6 × 5 = 30, then we can get the factors.\nSo, let us look for the pairs of factors of 30. Some are 1 and 30, 2 and 15, 3 and 10, 5\nand 6. Of these pairs, 2 and 15 will give us p + q = 17.23x\nx= 3x = first term of quotient\nReprint 2025-26\n\n34 MATHEMA TICS\nSo, 6 x2 + 17 x + 5 =6x2 + (2 + 15) x + 5\n=6x2 + 2x + 15 x + 5\n=2x(3x + 1) + 5(3 x + 1)\n=(3x + 1) (2 x + 5)\nSolution 2 :  (Using the Factor Theorem)\n6x2 + 17 x + 5 = 217 566 6x x + +   = 6 p(x), say . If a and b are the zeroes of p(x), then\n6x2 + 17 x + 5 = 6( x – a) (x – b). So, ab = 5.\n6 Let us look at some possibilities for a and\nb. They could be 1 1 5 5,, , , 12 3 3 2± ± ± ± ± . Now , 1 1 17 1 5\n2 4 6 2 6p   = + +       ≠ 0. But\n1\n3p− \n   = 0. So, 1\n3x +   is a factor of p(x). Similarly , by trial, you can find that\n5\n2x +   is a factor of p(x).\nTherefore, 6x2 + 17 x + 5 = 61 5\n3 2x x  + +    \n=3 1 2 563 2x x+ +  \n    \n=(3x + 1) (2 x + 5)\nFor the example above, the use of the splitting method appears more ef ficient. However ,\nlet us consider another example.\nExample 9 :  Factorise y2 – 5y + 6 by using the Factor Theorem.\nSolution :  Let p(y) = y2 – 5y + 6. Now , if p(y) = (y – a) (y – b), you know that the\nconstant term will be ab. So, ab = 6. So, to look for the factors of p(y), we look at the\nfactors of 6.\nThe factors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3.\nNow ,p(2) = 22 – (5 × 2) + 6 = 0\nSo, y – 2 is a factor of p(y).\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 35\nAlso, p(3) = 32 – (5 × 3) + 6 = 0\nSo, y – 3 is also a factor of y2 – 5y + 6.\nTherefore, y2 – 5y + 6 = ( y – 2)( y – 3)\nNote that y2 – 5y + 6 can also be factorised by splitting the middle term –5 y.\nNow , let us consider factorising cubic polynomials. Here, the splitting method will not\nbe appropriate to start with. We need to find at least one factor first, as you will see in\nthe following example.\nExample 10 :  Factorise x3 – 23 x2 + 142 x – 120.\nSolution :  Let p(x) =x3 – 23 x2 + 142 x – 120\nWe shall now look for all the factors of –120. Some of these are ±1, ±2, ±3,\n±4, ±5, ±6, ±8, ±10, ±12, ±15, ±20, ±24, ±30, ±60.\nBy trial, we find that p(1) = 0. So x – 1 is a factor of p(x).\nNow we see that x3 – 23 x2 + 142 x – 120 = x3 – x2 – 22\nx2 + 22 x + 120 x – 120\n                                            = x2(x –1) – 22 x(x – 1) + 120( x – 1) (Why?)\n                                            = (x – 1) ( x2 – 22 x + 120) [Taking ( x – 1) common]\nWe could have also got this by dividing p(x) by x – 1.\nNow x2 – 22 x + 120 can be factorised either by splitting the middle term or by using\nthe Factor theorem. By splitting the middle term, we have:\nx2 – 22 x + 120 = x2 – 12 x – 10 x + 120\n=x(x – 12) – 10( x – 12)\n=(x – 12) ( x – 10)\nSo, x3 – 23 x2 – 142 x – 120 = (x – 1)( x – 10)( x – 12)\nEXERCISE 2.3\n1.Determine which of the following polynomials has ( x + 1) a factor :\n(i)x3 + x2 + x + 1 (ii)x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1\n(iii)x4 + 3x3 + 3x2 + x + 1 (iv)x3 – x2 – () 2 2 2 x+ +\n2.Use the Factor Theorem to determine whether g(x) is a factor of p(x) in each of the\nfollowing cases:\n(i)p(x) = 2x3 + x2 – 2x – 1, g(x) = x + 1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n36 MATHEMA TICS\n(ii)p(x) = x3 + 3x2 + 3x + 1, g(x) = x + 2\n(iii)p(x) = x3 – 4x2 + x + 6, g(x) = x – 3\n3.Find the value of k, if x – 1 is a factor of p(x) in each of the following cases:\n(i)p(x) = x2 + x + k (ii)p(x) = 2x2 + kx + 2\n(iii)p(x) = kx2 – 2x + 1 (iv)p(x) = kx2 – 3x + k\n4.Factorise :\n(i)12x2 – 7x + 1 (ii)2x2 + 7x + 3\n(iii)6x2 + 5x – 6 (iv)3x2 – x – 4\n5.Factorise :\n(i)x3 – 2x2 – x + 2 (ii)x3 – 3x2 – 9x – 5\n(iii)x3 + 13 x2 + 32x + 20 (iv)2y3 + y2 – 2y – 1\n2.5 Algebraic Identities\nFrom your earlier classes, you may recall that an algebraic identity is an algebraic\nequation that is true for all values of the variables occurring in it.

You also know how\nto describe the position of a point on the line. There are many other situations, in which\nto find a point we are required to describe its position with reference to more than one\nline. For example, consider the following situations:\nI. In Fig. 3.1, there is a main road running\nin the East-W est direction and streets with\nnumbering from West to East. Also, on each\nstreet, house numbers are marked. To look for\na friend’ s house here, is it enough to know only\none reference point? For instance, if we only\nknow that she lives on Street 2, will we be able\nto find her house easily? Not as easily as when\nwe know two pieces of information about it,\nnamely , the number of the street on which it is\nsituated, and the house number . If we want to\nreach the house which is situated in the 2nd\nstreet and has the number 5, first of all we\nwould identify the 2nd street and then the house\nnumbered 5 on it. In Fig. 3.1, H shows the\nlocation of the house. Similarly , P shows the\nlocation of the house corresponding to Street\nnumber 7 and House number 4.Fig. 3.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n44 MATHEMA TICS\nII. Suppose you put a dot on a sheet of paper [Fig.3.2 (a)]. If we ask you to tell us\nthe position of the dot on the paper , how will you do this? Perhaps you will try in some\nsuch manner: “The dot is in the upper half of the paper”, or “It is near the left edge of\nthe paper”, or “It is very near the left hand upper corner of the sheet”. Do any of\nthese statements fix the position of the dot precisely? No! But, if you say “ The dot is\nnearly 5 cm away from the left edge of the paper”, it helps to give some idea but still\ndoes not fix the position of the dot. A little thought might enable you to say that the dot\nis also at a distance of 9 cm above the bottom line. We now know exactly where the dot is!\nFig. 3.2\nFor this purpose, we fixed the position of the dot by specifying its distances from two\nfixed lines, the left edge of the paper and the bottom line of the paper [Fig.3.2 (b)]. In\nother words, we need two independent informations for finding the position of the dot.\nNow , perform the following classroom activity known as ‘Seating Plan’.\nActivity 1 (Seating Plan) :  Draw a plan of the seating in your classroom, pushing all\nthe desks together . Represent each desk by a square. In each square, write the name\nof the student occupying the desk, which the square represents. Position of each\nstudent in the classroom is described precisely by using two independent informations:\n(i)the column in which she or he sits,\n(ii)the row in which she or he sits.\nIf you are sitting on the desk lying in the 5th column and 3rd row (represented by\nthe shaded square in Fig. 3.3), your position could be written as (5, 3), first writing the\ncolumn number , and then the row number . Is this the same as (3, 5)? Write down the\nnames and positions of other students in your class. For example, if Sonia is sitting in\nthe 4th column and 1st row, write S(4,1). The teacher ’s desk is not part of your seating\nplan. We are treating the teacher just as an observer .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCOORDINA TE GEOMETR Y 45\nFig. 3.3\nIn the discussion above, you observe that position of any object lying in a plane\ncan be represented with the help of two perpendicular lines. In case of ‘dot’, we\nrequire distance of the dot from bottom line as well as from left edge of the paper . In\ncase of seating plan, we require the number of the column and that of the row . This\nsimple idea has far reaching consequences, and has given rise to a very important\nbranch of Mathematics known as Coor dinate Geometr y. In this chapter , we aim to\nintroduce some basic concepts of coordinate geometry . You will study more about\nthese in your higher classes. This study was initially developed by the French philosopher\nand mathematician René Déscartes .\nRené Déscartes, the great French mathematician of the\nseventeenth century , liked to lie in bed and think! One\nday, when resting in bed, he solved the problem of\ndescribing the position of a point in a plane. His method\nwas a development of the older idea of latitude and\nlongitude. In honour of Déscartes, the system used for\ndescribing the position of a point in a plane is also\nknown as the Cartesian system.\nEXERCISE 3.1\n1.How will you describe the position of a table lamp on your study table to another\nperson?\n2.(Street Plan) :  A city has two main roads which cross each other at the centre of the\ncity. These two roads are along the North-South direction and East-W est direction.René Déscartes (1596 -1650)\nFig. 3.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n46 MATHEMA TICS\nAll the other streets of the city run parallel to these roads and are 200 m apart. There\nare 5 streets in each direction. Using 1cm = 200 m, draw a model of the city on your\nnotebook. Represent the roads/streets by single lines.\nThere are many cross- streets in your model. A particular cross-street is made by\ntwo streets, one running in the North - South direction and another in the East - West\ndirection. Each cross street is referred to in the following manner : If the 2nd street\nrunning in the North - South direction and 5th in the East - West direction meet at some\ncrossing, then we will call this cross-street (2, 5). Using this convention, find:\n(i)how many cross - streets can be referred to as (4, 3).\n(ii)how many cross - streets can be referred to as (3, 4).\n3.2 Cartesian System\nYou have studied the number line  in the chapter on ‘Number System’. On the number\nline, distances from a fixed point are marked in equal units positively in one direction\nand negatively in the other . The point from which the distances are marked is called\nthe origin . We use the number line to represent the numbers by marking points on a\nline at equal distances. If one unit distance represents the number ‘1’, then 3 units\ndistance represents the number ‘3’, ‘0’ being at the origin. The point in the positive\ndirection at a distance r from the origin represents the number r. The point in the\nnegative direction at a distance r from the origin represents the number −r. Locations\nof different numbers on the number line are shown in Fig. 3.5.\nFig. 3.5\nDescartes invented the idea of placing two such lines perpendicular to each other\non a plane, and locating points on the plane by referring them to these lines. The\nperpendicular lines may be in any direction such as in Fig.3.6. But, when we choose\nFig. 3.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCOORDINA TE GEOMETR Y 47\nthese two lines to locate a point in a plane in this chapter , one line\nwill be horizontal and the other will be vertical, as in Fig. 3.6(c).\nThese lines are actually obtained as follows : Take two number\nlines, calling them X ′X and Y′Y. Place X′X horizontal [as in Fig. 3.7(a)]\nand write the numbers on it just as written on the number line. We do\nthe same thing with Y′Y except that Y′Y is vertical, not horizontal\n[Fig. 3.7(b)].\nFig. 3.7\nCombine both the lines in such\na way that the two lines cross each\nother at their zeroes, or origins\n(Fig. 3.8). The horizontal line X ′X\nis called the x - axis and the vertical\nline YY′ is called the y - axis. The\npoint where X ′X and Y′Y cross is\ncalled the origin , and is denoted\nby O. Since the positive numbers\nlie on the directions OX and OY ,\nOX and OY are called the positive\ndirections  of the x - axis and the\ny - axis, respectively . Similarly , OX′\nand OY′ are called the negative\ndirections  of the x - axis and the\ny - axis, respectively .\nFig. 3.8\nReprint 2025-26\n\n48 MATHEMA TICS\nYou observe that the axes (plural of the word\n‘axis’) divide the plane into four parts. These four\nparts are called the quadrants  (one fourth part),\nnumbered I, II, III and IV anticlockwise from OX\n(see Fig.3.9). So, the plane consists of the axes and\nthese quadrants. We call the plane, the Cartesian\nplane,  or the coordinate plane,  or the xy-plane.\nThe axes are called the coordinate axes .\nNow , let us see why this system is so basic to mathematics, and how it is useful.\nConsider the following diagram where the axes are drawn on graph paper . Let us see\nthe distances of the points P and Q from the axes. For this, we draw perpendiculars\nPM on the x - axis and PN on the y - axis. Similarly , we draw perpendiculars QR and\nQS as shown in Fig. 3.10.\nFig.3.10\nYou find that\n(i)The perpendicular distance of the point P from the y - axis measured along the\npositive direction of the x - axis is PN = OM = 4 units.\n(ii)The perpendicular distance of the point P from the x - axis measured along the\npositive direction of the y - axis is PM = ON = 3 units.Fig. 3.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCOORDINA TE GEOMETR Y 49\n(iii)The perpendicular distance of the point Q from the y - axis measured along\nthe negative direction of the x - axis is OR = SQ = 6 units.\n(iv)The perpendicular distance of the point Q from the x - axis measured along\nthe negative direction of the y - axis is OS = RQ = 2 units.\nNow , using these distances, how can we describe the points so that there is no\nconfusion?\nWe write the coordinates of a point,  using the following conventions:\n(i)The x - coor dinate  of a point is its perpendicular distance from the y - axis\nmeasured along the x -axis (positive along the positive direction of the x - axis\nand negative along the negative direction of the  x - axis). For the point P , it is\n+ 4 and for Q, it is – 6. The x - coordinate is also called the abscissa .\n(ii)The y - coor dinate  of a point is its perpendicular distance from the x - axis\nmeasured along the y - axis (positive along the positive direction of the y - axis\nand negative along the negative  direction of the y - axis). For the point P , it is\n+ 3 and for Q, it is –2. The y - coordinate is also called the ordinate .\n(iii)In stating the coordinates of a point in the coordinate plane, the x - coordinate\ncomes first, and then the  y - coordinate . We place the coordinates in brackets.\nHence, the coordinates of P are (4, 3) and the coordinates of Q are (– 6, – 2).\nNote that the coordinates describe a point in the plane uniquely . (3, 4) is not the\nsame as (4, 3).\nExample 1 :  See Fig. 3.1 1 and complete the following statements:\n(i) The abscissa and the ordinate of the point B are _ _ _ and _ _ _, respectively .\nHence, the coordinates of B are (_ _, _ _).\n(ii) The x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the point M are _ _ _ and _ _ _,\nrespectively . Hence, the coordinates of M are (_ _, _ _).\n(iii) The x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the point L are _ _ _ and _ _ _,\nrespectively . Hence, the coordinates of L  are (_ _, _ _).\n(iv) The x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the point S are _ _ _ and _ _ _,\nrespectively . Hence, the coordinates of S are (_ _, _ _).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n50 MATHEMA TICS\nFig. 3.1 1\nSolution:  (i) Since the distance of the point B from the y - axis is 4 units, the\nx - coordinate or abscissa of the point B is 4.

Why?\nSince every point on the x - axis has no distance (zero distance) from the x - axis,\ntherefore, the y - coordinate of every point lying on the x - axis is always zero. Thus, the\ncoordinates of any point on the x - axis are of the form ( x, 0), where x is the distance of\nthe point from the \ny - axis. Similarly , the coordinates of any point on the y - axis are of\nthe form (0, y), where y is the distance of the point from the x - axis. Why?\nWhat are the coordinates of the origin O?

Can you write\ndown a linear equation in one variable? You may say that x + 1 = 0, x + 2 = 0 and\n2y + 3 = 0 are examples of linear equations in one variable. You also know that\nsuch equations have a unique (i.e., one and only one) solution. You may also remember\nhow to represent the solution on a number line. In this chapter , the knowledge of linear\nequations in one variable shall be recalled and extended to that of two variables. You\nwill be considering questions like: Does a linear equation in two variables have a\nsolution? If yes, is it unique? What does the solution look like on the Cartesian plane?\nYou shall also use the concepts you studied in Chapter 3 to answer these questions.\n4.2 Linear Equations\nLet us first recall what you have studied so far . Consider the following equation:\n2x + 5 = 0\nIts solution, i.e., the root of the equation, is 5\n2−. This can be represented on the\nnumber line as shown below:\nFig. 4.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n56 MATHEMA TICS\nWhile solving an equation, you must always keep the following points in mind:\nThe solution of a linear equation is not affected when:\n(i)the same number is added to (or subtracted from) both the sides of the equation.\n(ii)you multiply or divide both the sides of the equation by the same non-zero\nnumber .\nLet us now consider the following situation:\nIn a One-day International Cricket match between India and Sri Lanka played in\nNagpur , two Indian batsmen together scored 176 runs. Express this information in the\nform of an equation.\nHere, you can see that the score of neither of them is known, i.e., there are two\nunknown quantities. Let us use x and y to denote them. So, the number of runs scored\nby one of the batsmen is x, and the number of runs scored by the other is y. We know\nthat\nx + y =176,\nwhich is the required equation.\nThis is an example of a linear equation in two variables. It is customary to denote\nthe variables in such equations by x and y, but other letters may also be used. Some\nexamples of linear equations in two variables are:\n1.2s + 3t = 5, p + 4q =7, πu + 5v = 9 and 3 = 2x – 7y.\nNote that you can put these equations in the form 1.2 s + 3 t – 5 = 0,\np + 4q – 7 = 0, πu + 5v – 9 = 0 and 2x – 7y – 3 = 0, respectively .\nSo, any equation which can be put in the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c\nare real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two\nvariables . This means that you can think of many many such equations.\nExample 1 :  Write each of the following equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and\nindicate the values of a, b and c in each case:\n(i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 (ii) x – 4 = 3y (iii) 4 = 5 x – 3y (iv) 2 x = y\nSolution :  (i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 can be written as 2 x + 3y – 4.37 = 0. Here a = 2, b = 3\nand c = – 4.37.\n(ii) The equation x – 4 = 3y can be written as x – 3y – 4 = 0. Here a = 1,\nb = – 3 and c = – 4.\n(iii) The equation 4 = 5 x – 3y can be written as 5 x – 3y – 4 = 0. Here a = 5, b = –3\nand c = – 4. Do you agree that it can also be written as –5 x + 3y + 4 = 0 ? In this\ncase a = –5, b = 3 and c = 4.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINEAR  EQUA TIONS  IN TWO VARIABLES 57\n(iv) The equation 2 x = y can be written as 2 x – y + 0 = 0. Here a = 2, b = –1 and\nc = 0.\nEquations of the type ax + b = 0 are also examples of linear equations in two variables\nbecause they can be expressed as\nax + 0. y + b =0\nFor example, 4 – 3 x = 0 can be written as –3 x + 0.y + 4 = 0.\nExample 2 :  Write each of the following as an equation in two variables:\n(i) x = –5 (ii) y = 2 (iii) 2 x = 3 (iv) 5 y = 2\nSolution :  (i) x = –5 can be written as 1. x + 0. y = –5, or 1. x + 0.y + 5 = 0.\n(ii) y = 2 can be written as 0. x + 1.y = 2, or0.x + 1.y – 2 = 0.\n(iii) 2 x = 3 can be written as 2 x + 0.y – 3 = 0.\n(iv) 5 y = 2 can be written as 0. x + 5y – 2 = 0.\nEXERCISE 4.1\n1.The cost of a notebook is twice the cost of a pen. Write a linear equation in two\nvariables to represent this statement.\n(Take the cost of a notebook to be ` x and that of a pen to be ` y).\n2.Express the following linear equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and indicate the\nvalues of a, b and c in each case:\n(i)2x + 3y = 9.35 (ii)x – 5y – 10 = 0 (iii)–2x + 3y = 6 (iv)x = 3y\n(v)2x = –5 y (vi)3x + 2 = 0 (vii) y – 2 = 0 (viii) 5 = 2x\n4.3 Solution of a Linear Equation\nYou have seen that every linear equation in one variable has a unique solution. What\ncan you say about the solution of a linear equation involving two variables? As there\nare two variables in the equation, a solution means a pair of values, one for x and one\nfor y which satisfy the given equation. Let us consider the equation 2 x + 3y = 12.\nHere, x = 3 and y = 2 is a solution because when you substitute x = 3 and y = 2 in the\nequation above, you find that\n2x + 3y =(2 × 3) + (3 × 2) = 12\nThis solution is written as an ordered pair (3, 2), first writing the value for x and\nthen the value for y. Similarly , (0, 4) is also a solution for the equation above.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n58 MATHEMA TICS\nOn the other hand, (1, 4) is not a solution of 2 x + 3y = 12, because on putting\nx = 1 and y = 4 we get 2 x + 3y = 14, which is not 12. Note that (0, 4) is a solution but\nnot (4, 0).\nYou have seen at least two solutions for 2 x + 3y = 12, i.e., (3, 2) and (0, 4). Can\nyou find any other solution? Do you agree that (6, 0) is another solution? Verify the\nsame. In fact, we can get many many solutions in the following way . Pick a value of\nyour choice for x (say x = 2) in 2 x + 3y = 12. Then the equation reduces to 4 + 3 y = 12,\nwhich is a linear equation in one variable. On solving this, you get y = 8\n3. So 82,3 \n   is\nanother solution of 2 x + 3y = 12. Similarly , choosing x = – 5, you find that the equation\nbecomes –10 + 3 y = 12. This gives y = 22\n3. So, 225,3 −   is another solution of\n2x + 3y = 12. So there is no end to different solutions of a linear equation in two\nvariables. That is, a linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions.\nExample 3 :  Find four different solutions of the equation x + 2y = 6.\nSolution :  By inspection, x = 2, y = 2 is a solution because for x = 2, y = 2\nx + 2y =2 + 4 = 6\nNow , let us choose x = 0. With this value of x, the given equation reduces to 2 y = 6\nwhich has the unique solution y = 3. So x = 0, y = 3 is also a solution of x + 2y = 6.\nSimilarly , taking y = 0, the given equation reduces to x = 6. So, x = 6, y  = 0 is a solution\nof x + 2y = 6 as well. Finally , let us take y = 1. The given equation now reduces to\nx + 2 = 6, whose solution is given by x = 4. Therefore, (4, 1) is also a solution of the\ngiven equation. So four of the infinitely many solutions of the given equation are:\n(2, 2), (0, 3), (6, 0) and (4, 1).\nRemark :  Note that an easy way of getting a solution is to take x = 0 and get the\ncorresponding value of y. Similarly , we can put y = 0 and obtain the corresponding\nvalue of x.\nExample 4 :  Find two solutions for each of the following equations:\n(i)4x + 3y = 12\n(ii)2x + 5y = 0\n(iii)3y + 4 = 0\nSolution :  (i) Taking x = 0, we get 3 y = 12, i.e., y = 4. So, (0, 4) is a solution of the\ngiven equation. Similarly , by taking y = 0, we get x = 3. Thus, (3, 0) is also a solution.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINEAR  EQUA TIONS  IN TWO VARIABLES 59\n(ii) Taking x = 0, we get 5 y = 0, i.e., y = 0. So (0, 0) is a solution of the given equation.\nNow , if you take y = 0, you again get (0, 0) as a solution, which is the same as the\nearlier one. To get another solution, take x = 1, say . Then you can check that the\ncorresponding value of y is 2.\n5− So 21,5 −   is another solution of 2 x + 5y = 0.\n(iii) Writing the equation 3 y + 4 = 0 as 0. x + 3y  + 4 = 0, you will find that y = 4–3 for\nany value of x. Thus, two solutions can be given as 4 40, – and 1, –3 3   \n      .\nEXERCISE 4.2\n1.Which one of the following options is true, and why?\ny = 3x + 5 has\n(i) a unique solution, (ii) only two solutions, (iii) infinitely many solutions\n2.Write four solutions for each of the following equations:\n(i)2x + y = 7 (ii)πx + y = 9 (iii)x = 4y\n3.Check which of the following are solutions of the equation x – 2y = 4 and which are\nnot:\n(i)(0, 2) (ii)(2, 0) (iii)(4, 0)\n(iv)() 2 , 4 2 (v)(1, 1)\n4.Find the value of k, if x = 2, y = 1 is a solution of the equation 2 x + 3y = k.\n4.4 Summary\nIn this chapter , you have studied the following points:\n1.An equation of the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c are real numbers, such that a and\nb are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two variables.\n2.A linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions.\n3.Every point on the graph of a linear equation in two variables is a solution of the linear\nequation.

Geometry appears to have originated from\nthe need for measuring land. This branch of mathematics was studied in various\nforms in every ancient civilisation, be it in Egypt, Babylonia, China, India, Greece,\nthe Incas, etc. The people of these civilisations faced several practical problems\nwhich required the development of geometry in various ways.\nFor example, whenever the river Nile\noverflowed, it wiped out the boundaries between\nthe adjoining fields of dif ferent land owners. After\nsuch flooding, these boundaries had to be\nredrawn. For this purpose, the Egyptians\ndeveloped a number of geometric techniques and\nrules for calculating simple areas and also for\ndoing simple constructions. The knowledge of\ngeometry was also used by them for computing\nvolumes of granaries, and for constructing canals\nand pyramids. They also knew the correct formula\nto find the volume of a truncated pyramid (see\nFig. 5.1).Y ou know that a pyramid is a solid figure,\nthe base of which is a triangle, or square, or some\nother polygon, and its side faces are triangles\nconverging to a point at the top.Fig. 5.1 :  A Truncated Pyramid\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO EUCLID ’S GEOMETRY 61\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, etc.\nshow that the Indus Valley Civilisation (about 3000 BCE) made extensive use of\ngeometry . It was a highly or ganised society . The cities were highly developed and\nvery well planned. For example, the roads were parallel to each other and there was\nan underground drainage system. The houses had many rooms of different types. This\nshows that the town dwellers were skilled in mensuration and practical arithmetic.\nThe bricks used for constructions were kiln fired and the ratio length : breadth : thickness,\nof the bricks was found to be 4 : 2 : 1.\nIn ancient India, the Sulbasutras  (800 BCE to 500 BCE) were the manuals of\ngeometrical constructions. The geometry of the Vedic period originated with the\nconstruction of altars (or vedis ) and fireplaces for performing Vedic rites. The location\nof the sacred fires had to be in accordance to the clearly laid down instructions about\ntheir shapes and areas, if they were to be effective instruments. Square and circular\naltars were used for household rituals, while altars whose shapes were combinations\nof rectangles, triangles and trapeziums were required for public worship. The sriyantra\n(given in the Atharvaveda ) consists of nine interwoven isosceles triangles. These\ntriangles are arranged in such a way that they produce 43 subsidiary triangles. Though\naccurate geometric methods were used for the constructions of altars, the principles\nbehind them were not discussed.\nThese examples show that geometry was being developed and applied everywhere\nin the world. But this was happening in an unsystematic manner . What is interesting\nabout these developments of geometry in the ancient world is that they were passed\non from one generation to the next, either orally or through palm leaf messages, or by\nother ways. Also, we find that in some civilisations like Babylonia, geometry remained\na very practical oriented discipline, as was the case in India and Rome. The geometry\ndeveloped by Egyptians mainly consisted of the statements of results. There were no\ngeneral rules of the procedure. In fact, Babylonians and Egyptians used geometry\nmostly for practical purposes and did very little to develop it as a systematic science.\nBut in civilisations like Greece, the emphasis was on the reasoning  behind why certain\nconstructions work. The Greeks were interested in establishing the truth of the\nstatements they discovered using deductive reasoning (see Appendix 1).\nA Greek mathematician, Thales is credited with giving the\nfirst known proof. This proof was of the statement that a circle\nis bisected (i.e., cut into two equal parts) by its diameter . One of\nThales’ most famous pupils was Pythagoras (572 BCE), whom\nyou have heard about. Pythagoras and his group discovered many\ngeometric properties and developed the theory of geometry to a\ngreat extent. This process continued till 300 BCE. At that time\nEuclid, a teacher of mathematics at Alexandria in Egypt, collected\nall the known work and arranged it in his famous treatise,Thales\n(640 BCE – 546 BCE)\nFig. 5.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n62 MATHEMA TICS\ncalled ‘Elements’. He divided the ‘Elements’ into thirteen\nchapters, each called a book. These books influenced\nthe whole world’ s understanding of geometry for\ngenerations to come.\nIn this chapter , we shall discuss Euclid’ s approach\nto geometry and shall try to link it with the present day\ngeometry .\n5.2 Euclid’ s Definitions, Axioms and Postulates\nThe Greek mathematicians of Euclid’ s time thought of geometry as an abstract model\nof the world in which they lived. The notions of point, line, plane (or surface) and so on\nwere derived from what was seen around them. From studies of the space and solids\nin the space around them, an abstract geometrical notion of a solid object was developed.\nA solid has shape, size, position, and can be moved from one place to another . Its\nboundaries are called surfaces. They separate one part of the space from another ,\nand are said to have no thickness. The boundaries of the surfaces are curves  or\nstraight lines.  These lines end in points .\nConsider the three steps from solids to points (solids-surfaces-lines-points). In\neach step we lose one extension, also called a dimension . So, a solid has three\ndimensions, a surface has two, a line has one and a point has none. Euclid summarised\nthese statements as definitions. He began his exposition by listing 23 definitions in\nBook 1 of the ‘Elements’. A few of them are given below :\n1.A point  is that which has no part.\n2.A line is breadthless length.\n3.The ends of a line are points.\n4.A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.\n5.A surface is that which has length and breadth only .\n6.The edges of a surface are lines.\n7.A plane surface  is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.\nIf you carefully study these definitions, you find that some of the terms like part,\nbreadth, length, evenly , etc. need to be further explained clearly . For example, consider\nhis definition of a point. In this definition, ‘a part’ needs to be defined. Suppose if you\ndefine ‘a part’ to be that which occupies ‘area’, again ‘an area’ needs to be defined.\nSo, to define one thing, you need to define many other things, and you may get a long\nchain of definitions without an end. For such reasons, mathematicians agree to leaveEuclid (325 BCE – 265 BCE)\nFig. 5.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO EUCLID ’S GEOMETRY 63\nsome geometric terms undefined . However , we do have a intuitive feeling for the\ngeometric concept of a point than what the ‘definition’ above gives us. So, we represent\na point as a dot, even though a dot has some dimension.\nA similar problem arises in Definition 2 above, since it refers to breadth and length,\nneither of which has been defined. Because of this, a few terms are kept undefined\nwhile developing any course of study . So, in geometry , we take a point, a line and a\nplane (in Euclid‘s wor ds a plane surface ) as undefined terms . The only thing is\nthat we can represent them intuitively , or explain them with the help of ‘physical\nmodels’.\nStarting with his definitions, Euclid assumed certain properties, which were not to\nbe proved. These assumptions are actually ‘obvious universal truths’. He divided them\ninto two types: axioms and postulates. He used the term ‘ postulate ’ for the assumptions\nthat were specific to geometry . Common notions (often called axioms ), on the other\nhand, were assumptions used throughout mathematics and not specifically linked to\ngeometry . For details about axioms and postulates, refer to Appendix 1. Some of\nEuclid’ s axioms , not in his order , are given below :\n(1)Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another .\n(2)If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.\n(3)If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.\n(4)Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another .\n(5)The whole is greater than the part.\n(6)Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another .\n(7)Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another .\nThese ‘common notions’ refer to magnitudes of some kind. The first common\nnotion could be applied to plane figures. For example, if an area of a triangle equals the\narea of a rectangle and the area of the rectangle equals that of a square, then the area\nof the triangle also equals the area of the square.\nMagnitudes of the same kind can be compared and added, but magnitudes of\ndifferent kinds cannot be compared. For example, a line cannot be compared to a\nrectangle, nor can an angle be compared to a pentagon.\nThe 4th axiom given above seems to say that if two things are identical (that is,\nthey are the same), then they are equal. In other words, everything equals itself. It is\nthe justification of the principle of superposition. Axiom (5) gives us the definition of\n‘greater than’. For example, if a quantity B is a part of another quantity A, then A can\nbe written as the sum of B and some third quantity C. Symbolically , A > B means that\nthere is some C such that A = B + C.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n64 MATHEMA TICS\nNow let us discuss Euclid’ s five postulates.  They are :\nPostulate 1 :  A straight line may be drawn fr om any one point to any other point.\nNote that this postulate tells us that at least one straight line passes through two\ndistinct points, but it does not say that there cannot be more than one such line. However ,\nin his work, Euclid has frequently assumed, without mentioning, that there is a unique\nline joining two distinct points. We state this result in the form of an axiom as follows:\nAxiom 5.1 :  Given two distinct points, ther e is a unique line that passes thr ough\nthem .\nHow many lines passing through P also pass through Q (see Fig. 5.4)? Only one,\nthat is, the line PQ. How many lines passing through Q also pass through P? Only one,\nthat is, the line PQ. Thus, the statement above is self-evident, and so is taken as an\naxiom.\nFig. 5.4\nPostulate 2 :  A terminated line can be pr oduced indefinitely .\nNote that what we call a line segment now-a-days is what Euclid called a terminated\nline. So, according to the present day terms, the second postulate says that a line\nsegment can be extended on either side to form a line (see Fig. 5.5).\nFig. 5.5\nPostulate 3 : A circle can be drawn with any centr e and any radius .\nPostulate 4 : All right angles ar e equal to one another .\nPostulate 5 : If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior\nangles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the\ntwo straight lines, if pr oduced indefinitely , meet on that side on which the sum of\nangles is less than two right angles.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO EUCLID ’S GEOMETRY 65\nFor example, the line PQ in Fig. 5.6 falls on lines\nAB and CD such that the sum of the interior angles 1\nand 2 is less than 180° on the left side of PQ.\nTherefore, the lines AB and CD will eventually\nintersect on the left side of PQ.\nA brief look at the five postulates brings to your notice that Postulate 5 is far more\ncomplex than any other postulate. On the other hand, Postulates 1 through 4 are so\nsimple and obvious that these are taken as ‘self-evident truths’. However , it is not\npossible to prove them. So, these statements are accepted without any proof\n(see Appendix 1). Because of its complexity , the fifth postulate will be given more\nattention in the next section.\nNow-a-days, ‘postulates’ and ‘axioms’ are terms that are used interchangeably\nand in the same sense. ‘Postulate’ is actually a verb. When we say “let us postulate”,\nwe mean, “let us make some statement based on the observed phenomenon in the\nUniverse”. Its truth/validity is checked afterwards. If it is true, then it is accepted as a\n‘Postulate’.\nA system of axioms is called consistent (see Appendix 1), if it is impossible to\ndeduce from these axioms a statement that contradicts any axiom or previously proved\nstatement. So, when any system of axioms is given, it needs to be ensured that the\nsystem is consistent.\nAfter Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results.\nThen using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive reasoning.\nThe statements that were proved are called propositions or theorems . Euclid\ndeduced 465 propositions in a logical chain using his axioms, postulates, definitions and\ntheorems proved earlier in the chain. In the next few chapters on geometry , you will\nbe using these axioms to prove some theorems.\nNow, let us see in the following examples how Euclid used his axioms and postulates\nfor proving some of the results:\nExample 1 :  If A, B and C are three points on a line, and B lies between A and C\n(see Fig. 5.7), then prove that AB + BC = AC.\nFig. 5.7Fig. 5.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n66 MATHEMA TICS\nSolution :  In the figure given above, AC coincides with AB + BC.\nAlso, Euclid’ s Axiom (4) says that things which coincide with one another are equal to\none another . So, it can be deduced that\nAB + BC = AC\nNote that in this solution, it has been assumed that there is a unique line passing\nthrough two points.\nExample 2 :  Prove that an equilateral triangle can be constructed on any given line\nsegment.\nSolution :  In the statement above, a line segment of any length is given, say AB\n[see Fig. 5.8(i)].\nFig. 5.8\nHere, you need to do some construction. Using Euclid’ s Postulate 3, you can draw a\ncircle with point A as the centre and AB as the radius [see Fig. 5.8(ii)]. Similarly , draw\nanother circle with point B as the centre and BA as the radius. The two circles meet at\na point, say C. Now , draw the line segments AC and BC to form ∆ ABC\n[see Fig. 5.8 (iii)].\nSo, you have to prove that this triangle is equilateral, i.e., AB = AC = BC.\nNow, AB = AC, since they are the radii of the same circle (1)\nSimilarly ,AB = BC (Radii of the same circle) (2)\nFrom these two facts, and Euclid’ s axiom that things which are equal to the same thing\nare equal to one another , you can conclude that AB = BC = AC.\nSo, ∆ ABC is an equilateral triangle.\nNote that here Euclid has assumed, without mentioning anywhere, that the two circles\ndrawn with centres A and B will meet each other at a point.\nNow we prove a theorem, which is frequently used in different results:\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO EUCLID ’S GEOMETRY 67\nTheor em 5.1 :  Two distinct lines cannot have mor e than one point in common.\nProof :  Here we are given two lines l and m. We need to prove that they have only one\npoint in common.\nFor the time being, let us suppose that the two lines intersect in two distinct points,\nsay P and Q. So, you have two lines passing through two distinct points P and Q. But\nthis assumption clashes with the axiom that only one line can pass through two distinct\npoints. So, the assumption that we started with, that two lines can pass through two\ndistinct points is wrong.\nFrom this, what can we conclude? We are forced to conclude that two distinct\nlines cannot have more than one point in common.\nEXERCISE 5.1\n1.Which of the following statements are true and which are false? Give reasons for your\nanswers.\n(i)Only one line can pass through a single point.\n(ii)There are an infinite number of lines which pass through two distinct points.\n(iii)A terminated line can be produced indefinitely on both the sides.\n(iv)If two circles are equal, then their radii are equal.\n(v)In Fig. 5.9, if AB = PQ and PQ = XY , then AB = XY .\nFig. 5.9\n2.Give a definition for each of the following terms. Are there other terms that need to be\ndefined first? What are they , and how might you define them?\n(i)parallel lines (ii)perpendicular lines (iii)line segment\n(iv)radius of a circle (v)square\n3.Consider two ‘postulates’ given below:\n(i)Given any two distinct points A and B, there exists a third point C which is in\nbetween A and B.\n(ii)There exist at least three points that are not on the same line.\nDo these postulates contain any undefined terms? Are these postulates consistent?\nDo they follow from Euclid’ s postulates? Explain.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n68 MATHEMA TICS\n4.If a point C lies between two points A and B such that AC = BC, then prove that\nAC = 1\n2AB. Explain by drawing the figure.\n5.In Question 4, point C is called a mid-point of line segment AB. Prove that every line\nsegment has one and only one mid-point.\n6.In Fig. 5.10, if AC = BD, then prove that AB = CD.\nFig. 5.10\n7.Why is Axiom 5, in the list of Euclid’ s axioms, considered a ‘universal truth’? (Note that\nthe question is not about the fifth postulate.)\n5.3 Summary\nIn this chapter , you have studied the following points:\n1.Though Euclid defined a point, a line, and a plane, the definitions are not accepted by\nmathematicians. Therefore, these terms are now taken as undefined.\n2.Axioms or postulates are the assumptions which are obvious universal truths. They are not\nproved.\n3.Theorems are statements which are proved, using definitions, axioms, previously proved\nstatements and deductive reasoning.\n4.Some of Euclid’ s axioms were :\n(1)Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another .\n(2)If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.\n(3)If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.\n(4)Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another .\n(5)The whole is greater than the part.\n(6)Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another .\n(7)Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another .\n5.Euclid’ s postulates were :\nPostulate 1 :  A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.\nPostulate 2 :  A terminated line can be produced indefinitely .\nPostulate 3 :  A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.\nPostulate  4 :  All right angles are equal to one another .\nReprint 2025-26\n"}

You have also studied some axioms and, with the help of these axioms, you\nproved some other statements. In this chapter , you will study the properties of the\nangles formed when two lines intersect each other , and also the properties of the\nangles formed when a line intersects two or more parallel lines at distinct points.\nFurther you will use these properties to prove some statements using deductive reasoning\n(see Appendix 1). You have already verified these statements through some activities\nin the earlier classes.\nIn your daily life, you see different types of angles formed between the edges of\nplane surfaces. For making a similar kind of model using the plane surfaces, you need\nto have a thorough knowledge of angles. For instance, suppose you want to make a\nmodel of a hut to keep in the school exhibition using bamboo sticks. Imagine how you\nwould make it? You would keep some of the sticks parallel to each other , and some\nsticks would be kept slanted. Whenever an architect has to draw a plan for a multistoried\nbuilding, she has to draw intersecting lines and parallel lines at dif ferent angles. Without\nthe knowledge of the properties of these lines and angles, do you think she can draw\nthe layout of the building?\nIn science, you study the properties of light by drawing the ray diagrams.\nFor example, to study the refraction property of light when it enters from one medium\nto the other medium, you use the properties of intersecting lines and parallel lines.\nWhen two or more forces act on a body , you draw the diagram in which forces are\nrepresented by directed line segments to study the net effect of the forces on the\nbody . At that time, you need to know the relation between the angles when the rays\n(or line segments) are parallel to or intersect each other . To find the height of a tower\nor to find the distance of a ship from the light house, one needs to know the angle\nReprint 2025-26\n\n70 MATHEMA TICS\nformed between the horizontal and the line of sight. Plenty of other examples can be\ngiven where lines and angles are used. In the subsequent chapters of geometry , you\nwill be using these properties of lines and angles to deduce more and more useful\nproperties.\nLet us first revise the terms and definitions related to lines and angles learnt in\nearlier classes.\n6.2 Basic Terms and Definitions\nRecall that a part (or portion) of a line with two end points is called a line-segment\nand a part of a line with one end point is called a ray. Note that the line segment AB is\ndenoted by AB, and its length is denoted by AB. The ray AB is denoted by AB\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002, and\na line is denoted by AB\u0003\u0001\u0001\u0002. However , we will not use these symbols , and will denote\nthe line segment AB, ray AB, length AB and line AB by the same symbol, AB. The\nmeaning will be clear from the context. Sometimes small letters l, m, n, etc. will be\nused to denote lines.\nIf three or more points lie on the same line, they are called collinear points ;\notherwise they are called non-collinear points .\nRecall that an angle is formed when two rays originate from the same end point.\nThe rays making an angle are called the arms  of the angle and the end point is called\nthe vertex of the angle. You have studied dif ferent types of angles, such as acute\nangle, right angle, obtuse angle, straight angle and reflex angle in earlier classes\n(see Fig. 6.1).\n(i) acute angle : 0° < x < 90° (ii) right angle : y = 90° (iii) obtuse angle : 90° < z < 180°\n(iv) straight angle : s = 180° (v) reflex angle : 180° < t < 360°\nFig. 6.1 : Types of Angles\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 71\nAn acute angle measures between 0° and 90°, whereas a right  angle is exactly\nequal to 90°. An angle greater than 90° but less than 180° is called an obtuse angle .\nAlso, recall that a straight angle is equal to 180°. An angle which is greater than 180°\nbut less than 360° is called a reflex angle . Further , two angles whose sum is 90° are\ncalled complementary angles , and two angles whose sum is 180° are called\nsupplementary angles .\nYou have also studied about adjacent angles\nin the earlier classes (see Fig. 6.2). Two angles\nare adjacent , if they have a common vertex, a\ncommon arm and their non-common arms are\non different sides of the common arm. In\nFig. 6.2, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are adjacent\nangles. Ray BD is their common arm and point\nB is their common vertex. Ray BA and ray BC\nare non common arms. Moreover , when two\nangles are adjacent, then their sum is always\nequal to the angle formed by the two non-\ncommon arms. So, we can write\n∠ ABC = ∠ ABD + ∠ DBC.\nNote that ∠ ABC and ∠ ABD are not\nadjacent angles. Why? Because their non-\ncommon arms BD and BC lie on the same side\nof the common arm BA.\nIf the non-common arms BA and BC in\nFig. 6.2, form a line then it will look like Fig. 6.3.\nIn this case, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are called\nlinear pair of angles .\nYou may also recall the vertically opposite\nangles  formed when two lines, say AB and CD,\nintersect each other , say at the point O\n(see Fig. 6.4). There are two pairs of vertically\nopposite angles.\nOne pair is ∠AOD and ∠BOC. Can you\nfind the other pair?Fig. 6.2 : Adjacent angles\nFig. 6.3 : Linear pair of angles\nFig. 6.4 : Vertically opposite\nangles\nReprint 2025-26\n\n72 MATHEMA TICS\n6.3 Intersecting Lines and Non-intersecting Lines\nDraw two dif ferent lines PQ and RS on a paper . You will see that you can draw them\nin two different ways as shown in Fig. 6.5 (i) and Fig. 6.5 (ii).\n(i) Intersecting lines (ii) Non-intersecting (parallel) lines\nFig. 6.5 : Different ways of drawing two lines\nRecall the notion of a line, that it extends indefinitely in both directions. Lines PQ\nand RS in Fig. 6.5 (i) are intersecting lines and in Fig. 6.5 (ii) are parallel lines. Note\nthat the lengths of the common perpendiculars at different points on these parallel\nlines is the same. This equal length is called the distance between two parallel lines .\n6.4 Pairs of Angles\nIn Section 6.2, you have learnt the definitions of\nsome of the pairs of angles such as\ncomplementary angles, supplementary angles,\nadjacent angles, linear pair of angles, etc. Can\nyou think of some relations between these\nangles? Now , let us find out the relation between\nthe angles formed when a ray stands on a line.\nDraw a figure in which a ray stands on a line as\nshown in Fig. 6.6. Name the line as AB and the\nray as OC. What are the angles formed at the\npoint O? They are ∠ AOC, ∠ BOC and ∠ AOB.\nCan we write ∠ AOC + ∠ BOC = ∠ AOB? (1)\nYes! (Why? Refer to adjacent angles in Section 6.2)\nWhat is the measure of ∠ AOB? It is 180°. (Why?) (2)\nFrom (1) and (2), can you say that ∠ AOC + ∠ BOC = 180°? Yes! (Why?)\nFrom the above discussion, we can state the following Axiom:Fig. 6.6 : Linear pair of angles\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 73\nAxiom 6.1 :  If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of two adjacent angles so\nformed is 180°.\nRecall that when the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then they are called a\nlinear pair of angles .\nIn Axiom 6.1, it is given that ‘a ray stands on a line’. From this ‘given’, we have\nconcluded that ‘the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is 180°’. Can we write\nAxiom 6.1 the other way? That is, take the ‘conclusion’  of Axiom 6.1 as ‘given’  and\nthe ‘given’ as the ‘conclusion’. So it becomes:\n(A) If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then a ray stands on a line (that is,\nthe non-common arms form a line).\nNow you see that the Axiom 6.1 and statement (A) are in a sense the reverse of\neach others. We call each as converse of the other . We do not know whether the\nstatement (A) is true or not. Let us check. Draw adjacent angles of different measures\nas shown in Fig. 6.7. Keep the ruler along one of the non-common arms in each case.\nDoes the other non-common arm also lie along the ruler?\nFig. 6.7 : Adjacent angles with dif ferent measur es\nReprint 2025-26\n\n74 MATHEMA TICS\nYou will find that only in Fig. 6.7 (iii), both the non-common arms lie along the\nruler, that is, points A, O and B lie on the same line and ray OC stands on it. Also see\nthat ∠ AOC + ∠ COB = 125° + 55° = 180°. From this, you may conclude that statement\n(A) is true. So, you can state in the form of an axiom as follows:\nAxiom 6.2 :  If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°,  then the non-common arms\nof the angles form a line .\nFor obvious reasons, the two axioms above together is called the Linear Pair\nAxiom .\nLet us now examine the case when two lines intersect each other .\nRecall, from earlier classes,  that when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite\nangles are equal. Let us prove this result now . See Appendix 1 for the ingredients of a\nproof, and keep those in mind while studying the proof given below .\nTheor em 6.1 :  If two lines intersect each other , then the ver tically opposite\nangles ar e equal .\nProof :  In the statement above, it is given\nthat ‘two lines intersect each other ’. So, let\nAB and CD be two lines intersecting at O as\nshown in Fig. 6.8. They lead to two pairs of\nvertically opposite angles, namely ,\n(i) ∠ AOC and ∠ BOD (ii) ∠ AOD and\n∠ BOC.\nWe need to prove that ∠ AOC = ∠ BOD\nand ∠ AOD = ∠ BOC.\nNow , ray OA  stands on line CD.\nTherefore, ∠ AOC + ∠ AOD = 180° (Linear pair axiom) (1)\nCan we write ∠ AOD + ∠ BOD = 180°? Yes! (Why?) (2)\nFrom (1) and (2), we can write\n                                  ∠ AOC + ∠ AOD = ∠ AOD + ∠ BOD\nThis implies that ∠ AOC = ∠ BOD (Refer Section 5.2, Axiom 3)\nSimilarly , it can be proved that ∠AOD = ∠BOC\nNow , let us do some examples based on Linear Pair Axiom and Theorem 6.1.Fig. 6.8 : Vertically opposite angles\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 75\nFig. 6.9Example 1 : In Fig. 6.9, lines PQ and RS\nintersect each other at point O. If\n∠ POR : ∠ ROQ = 5 : 7, find all the angles.\nSolution : ∠ POR + ∠ ROQ = 180°\n(Linear pair of angles)\nBut ∠ POR : ∠ ROQ = 5 : 7\n(Given)\nTherefore, ∠ POR =5\n12 × 180° = 75°\nSimilarly , ∠ ROQ =7\n12 × 180° = 105°\nNow, ∠ POS = ∠ROQ = 105° (Vertically opposite angles)\nand ∠ SOQ = ∠POR = 75° (Vertically opposite angles)\nExample 2 :  In Fig. 6.10, ray OS stands on a line POQ. Ray OR and ray OT are\nangle bisectors of ∠ POS and ∠ SOQ, respectively . If ∠ POS = x, find ∠ ROT .\nSolution :  Ray OS stands on the line POQ.\nTherefore, ∠ POS + ∠ SOQ = 180°\nBut, ∠ POS = x\nTherefore, x + ∠ SOQ = 180°\nSo, ∠ SOQ = 180° – x\nNow , ray OR bisects ∠ POS, therefore,\n∠ ROS =1\n2 × ∠ POS\n=1\n2 × x = 2x\nSimilarly , ∠ SOT =1\n2 × ∠ SOQ\n=1\n2 × (180° – x)\n=902x° −Fig. 6.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\n76 MATHEMA TICS\nNow, ∠ ROT = ∠ ROS + ∠ SOT\n= 90 –2 2x x+ °\n=90°\nExample 3 :  In Fig. 6.1 1, OP , OQ, OR and OS are\nfour rays. Prove that ∠ POQ + ∠ QOR + ∠ SOR +\n∠ POS = 360°.\nSolution :  In Fig. 6.1 1, you need to produce any of\nthe rays OP , OQ, OR or OS backwards to a point.\nLet us produce ray OQ backwards to a point T so\nthat TOQ is a line (see Fig. 6.12).\nNow , ray OP  stands on line TOQ.\nTherefore, ∠ TOP + ∠ POQ = 180° (1)\n(Linear pair axiom)\nSimilarly , ray OS stands on line TOQ.\nTherefore, ∠ TOS + ∠ SOQ = 180° (2)\nBut ∠ SOQ = ∠ SOR + ∠ QOR\nSo, (2) becomes\n∠ TOS + ∠ SOR + ∠ QOR = 180° (3)\nNow , adding (1) and (3), you get\n∠ TOP + ∠ POQ + ∠ TOS + ∠ SOR + ∠ QOR = 360° (4)\nBut ∠ TOP + ∠ TOS = ∠ POS\nTherefore, (4) becomes\n∠ POQ + ∠ QOR + ∠ SOR + ∠ POS = 360°\nEXERCISE 6.1\n1.In Fig. 6.13, lines AB and CD intersect at O.

Let us\ncheck it. See Fig. 6.18 in which line m || line l and line n || line l.\nLet us draw a line t transversal for the lines, l, m and n. It is given that\nline m || line l and line n || line l.\nTherefore, ∠ 1 = ∠ 2and ∠ 1 = ∠ 3\n(Corresponding angles axiom)\nSo, ∠ 2 = ∠ 3 (Why?)\nBut ∠ 2 and ∠ 3 are corresponding angles and they\nare equal.\nTherefore, you can say that\nLine m || Line n\n(Converse of corresponding angles axiom)\nThis result can be stated in the form of the following theorem:\nTheor em 6.6 :  Lines which ar e parallel to the same line ar e parallel to each\nother .\nNote : The property above can be extended to more than two lines also.\nNow , let us solve some examples related to parallel lines.\nExample 4 :  In Fig. 6.19, if PQ || RS, ∠ MXQ = 135° and ∠ MYR = 40°, find ∠ XMY .\nFig. 6.19 Fig. 6.20\nSolution :  Here, we need to draw a line AB parallel to line PQ, through point M as\nshown in Fig. 6.20.

Ray BE is the bisector of ∠ ABQ and ray CG is the bisector of\n∠ BCS; and BE || CG.\nWe are to prove that PQ || RS.\nIt is given that ray BE is the bisector of ∠ ABQ.\nTherefore, ∠ ABE =1\n2 ∠ ABQ  (1)\nSimilarly , ray CG is the bisector of ∠ BCS.\nTherefore, ∠ BCG =1\n2 ∠ BCS  (2)\nBut BE || CG and AD is the transversal.\nTherefore, ∠ ABE = ∠ BCG\n            (Corresponding angles axiom)  (3)\nSubstituting (1) and (2) in (3), you get\n1\n2 ∠ ABQ =1\n2 ∠ BCS\nThat is, ∠ ABQ = ∠ BCSFig. 6.21\nReprint 2025-26\n\n80 MATHEMA TICS\nBut, they are the corresponding angles formed by transversal AD with PQ and RS;\nand are equal.\nTherefore, PQ || RS\n(Converse of corresponding angles axiom)\nExample 6 :  In Fig. 6.22, AB || CD and CD || EF .

For\nexample, in triangle ABC, denoted as ∆ ABC (see Fig. 7.1); AB, BC, CA  are the three\nsides, ∠ A, ∠ B, ∠ C are the three angles and A, B, C are three vertices.\nIn Chapter 6, you have also studied some properties\nof triangles.

You will observe that the squares are\ncongruent to each other and so are the\nequilateral triangles.\nYou may wonder why we are studying congruence. You all must have seen the ice\ntray in your refrigerator . Observe that the moulds for making ice are all congruent.\nThe cast used for moulding in the tray also has congruent depressions (may be all are\nrectangular or all circular or all triangular). So, whenever identical objects have to be\nproduced, the concept of congruence is used in making the cast.\nSometimes, you may find it difficult to replace the refill in your pen by a new one\nand this is so when the new refill is not of the same size as the one you want to\nremove. Obviously , if the two refills are identical or congruent, the new refill fits.\nSo, you can find numerous examples where congruence of objects is applied in\ndaily life situations.\nCan you think of some more examples of congruent figures?\nNow , which of the following figures are not congruent to the square in\nFig 7.3 (i) :\nFig. 7.3\nThe large squares in Fig. 7.3 (ii) and (iii) are obviously not congruent to the one in\nFig 7.3 (i), but the square in Fig 7.3 (iv) is congruent to the one given in Fig 7.3 (i).\nLet us now discuss the congruence of two triangles.\nYou already know that two triangles are congruent if the sides and angles of one\ntriangle are equal to the corresponding sides and angles of the other triangle.Fig. 7.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 85\nNow , which of the triangles given below are congruent to triangle ABC in\nFig. 7.4 (i)?\nFig. 7.4\nCut out each of these triangles from Fig. 7.4 (ii) to (v) and turn them around and\ntry to cover ∆ ABC. Observe that triangles in Fig. 7.4 (ii), (iii) and (iv) are congruent\nto ∆ ABC while ∆ TSU of Fig 7.4 (v) is not congruent to ∆ ABC.\nIf ∆ PQR is congruent to ∆ ABC, we write ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC.\nNotice that when ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC, then sides of ∆ PQR fall on corresponding\nequal sides of ∆ ABC and so is the case for the angles.\nThat is, PQ covers AB, QR covers BC and RP  covers CA; ∠ P  covers ∠ A,\n∠ Q covers ∠ B and ∠ R covers ∠ C. Also, there is a one-one correspondence\nbetween the vertices. That is, P  corresponds to A, Q to B, R to C and so on which is\nwritten as\nP ↔\n A, Q ↔ B,R ↔ C\nNote that under this correspondence, ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC; but it will not be correct to\nwrite ∆QRP  ≅ ∆ ABC.\nSimilarly , for Fig. 7.4 (iii),\nReprint 2025-26\n\n86 MATHEMA TICS\nFD ↔ AB, DE ↔ BC and EF ↔ CA\nand F ↔ A, D ↔ Band E ↔ C\nSo, ∆ FDE ≅ ∆ ABC but writing ∆ DEF ≅ ∆ ABC is not correct.\nGive the correspondence between the triangle in Fig. 7.4 (iv) and ∆ ABC.\nSo, it is necessary to write the correspondence of vertices correctly for writing of\ncongruence of triangles in symbolic form.\nNote that in congruent triangles  corresponding parts are equal and we write\nin short ‘CPCT’  for corresponding par ts of congr uent triangles .\n7.3 Criteria for  Congruence of Triangles\nIn earlier classes, you have learnt four criteria for congruence of triangles. Let us\nrecall them.\nDraw two triangles with one side 3 cm. Are these triangles congruent? Observe\nthat they are not congruent (see Fig. 7.5).\nFig. 7.5\nNow , draw two triangles with one side 4 cm and one angle 50° (see Fig. 7.6). Are\nthey congruent?\nFig. 7.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 87\nSee that these two triangles are not congruent.\nRepeat this activity with some more pairs of triangles.\nSo, equality of one pair of sides or one pair of sides and one pair of angles is not\nsufficient to give us congruent triangles.\nWhat would happen if the other pair of arms (sides) of the equal angles are also\nequal?\nIn Fig 7.7, BC = QR, ∠ B = ∠ Q and also, AB = PQ. Now , what can you say\nabout congruence of ∆ABC and ∆PQR?\nRecall from your earlier classes that, in this case, the two triangles are congruent.\nVerify this for ∆ ABC and ∆ PQR in Fig. 7.7.\nRepeat this activity with other pairs of triangles. Do you observe that the equality\nof two sides and the included angle is enough for the congruence of triangles? Yes, it\nis enough.\nFig. 7.7\nThis is the first criterion for congruence of triangles.\nAxiom 7.1  (SAS congruence rule) :  Two triangles ar e congr uent if two sides\nand the included angle of one triangle ar e equal to the two sides and the included\nangle of the other triangle.\nThis result cannot be proved with the help of previously known results and so it is\naccepted true as an axiom (see Appendix 1).\nLet us now take some examples.\nExample 1 :  In Fig. 7.8, OA = OB and OD = OC. Show that\n(i) ∆ AOD ≅ ∆ BOC and (ii) AD || BC.\nSolution :  (i) You may observe that in ∆ AOD and ∆ BOC,\nOA = OB(Given)\nOD = OC\nFig. 7.8\n\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n88 MATHEMA TICS\nAlso, since ∠ AOD and ∠ BOC form a pair of vertically opposite angles, we have\n∠ AOD = ∠ BOC.\nSo, ∆ AOD ≅∆ BOC (by the SAS congruence rule)\n(ii)In congruent triangles AOD and BOC, the other corresponding parts are also\nequal.\nSo, ∠ OAD = ∠ OBC and these form a pair of alternate angles for line segments\nAD and BC.\nTherefore, AD || BC.\nExample 2 :  AB is a line segment and line l is its perpendicular bisector . If a point P\nlies on l, show that P  is equidistant from A and B.\nSolution :  Line l ⊥ AB and passes through C which\nis the mid-point of AB (see Fig. 7.9). You have to\nshow that P A = PB. Consider ∆ PCA  and ∆ PCB.\nWe have AC = BC (C is the mid-point of AB)\n∠ PCA = ∠ PCB = 90°  (Given)\nPC = PC  (Common)\nSo, ∆ PCA ≅ ∆ PCB (SAS rule)\nand so, P A = PB, as they are corresponding sides of\ncongruent triangles.\nNow , let us construct two triangles, whose sides are 4 cm and 5 cm and one of the\nangles is 50° and this angle is not included in between the equal sides (see Fig. 7.10).\nAre the two triangles congruent?\nFig. 7.10Fig. 7.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 89\nNotice that the two triangles are not congruent.\nRepeat this activity with more pairs of triangles. You will observe that for triangles\nto be congruent, it is very important that the equal angles are included between the\npairs of equal sides.\nSo, SAS congr uence r ule holds but not ASS or SSA  rule.\nNext, try to construct the two triangles in which two angles are 60° and 45° and\nthe side included between these angles is 4 cm (see Fig. 7.1 1).\nFig. 7.1 1\nCut out these triangles and place one triangle on the other . What do you observe?\nSee that one triangle covers the other completely; that is, the two triangles are congruent.\nRepeat this activity with more pairs of triangles. You will observe that equality of two\nangles and the included side is sufficient for congruence of triangles.\nThis result is the Angle-Side-Angle criterion for congruence and is written as\nASA  criterion. You have verified this criterion in earlier classes, but let us state and\nprove this result.\nSince this result can be proved, it is called a theorem and to prove it, we use the\nSAS axiom for congruence.\nTheor em 7.1   (ASA  congruence rule) :  Two triangles ar e congr uent if two angles\nand the included side of one triangle ar e equal to two angles and the included\nside of other triangle .\nProof :  We are given two triangles ABC and DEF in which:\n∠ B = ∠ E, ∠ C = ∠ F\nand BC = EF\nWe need to prove that ∆ ABC ≅∆ DEF\nFor proving the congruence of the two triangles see that three cases arise.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n90 MATHEMA TICS\nCase (i) : Let AB = DE (see Fig. 7.12).\nNow what do you observe? You may observe that\nAB = DE (Assumed)\n∠ B = ∠ E (Given)\nBC = EF (Given)\nSo, ∆ ABC ≅∆ DEF (By SAS rule)\nFig. 7.12\nCase (ii) :  Let if possible AB > DE. So, we can take a point P on AB such that\nPB = DE. Now consider ∆ PBC and ∆ DEF (see Fig. 7.13).\nFig. 7.13\nObserve that in ∆ PBC and ∆ DEF,\nPB = DE (By construction)\n∠ B =∠ E (Given)\nBC = EF (Given)\nSo, we can conclude that:\n∆ PBC ≅ ∆ DEF, by the SAS axiom for congruence.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 91\nSince the triangles are congruent, their corresponding parts will be equal.\nSo, ∠ PCB = ∠ DFE\nBut, we are given that\n∠ ACB = ∠ DFE\nSo, ∠ ACB = ∠ PCB\nIs this possible?\nThis is possible only if P  coincides with A.\nor, BA = ED\nSo, ∆ ABC ≅∆ DEF (by SAS axiom)\nCase (iii) :  If AB < DE, we can choose a point M on DE such that ME = AB and\nrepeating the ar guments as given in Case (ii),  we can conclude that AB = DE and so,\n∆ ABC ≅ ∆ DEF.\nSuppose, now in two triangles two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding\nsides are equal but the side is not included between the corresponding equal pairs of\nangles. Are the triangles still congruent? You will observe that they are congruent.\nCan you reason out why?\nYou know that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180°. So if two pairs of\nangles are equal, the third pair is also equal (180° – sum of equal angles).\nSo, two triangles ar e congr uent if any two pairs of angles and one pair of\ncorresponding sides ar e equal . We may call it as the AAS Congruence Rule .\nNow let us perform the following activity :\nDraw triangles with angles 40°, 50° and 90°. How many such triangles can you\ndraw?\nIn fact, you can draw as many triangles as you want with different lengths of\nsides (see Fig. 7.14).\nFig. 7.14\nReprint 2025-26\n\n92 MATHEMA TICS\nObserve that the triangles may or may not be congruent to each other .\nSo, equality of three angles is not sufficient for congruence of triangles. Therefore,\nfor congruence of triangles out of three equal parts, one has to be a side.\nLet us now take some more examples.\nExample 3 :  Line-segment AB is parallel to another line-segment CD. O is the\nmid-point of AD (see Fig. 7.15). Show that (i) ∆AOB ≅ ∆DOC (ii) O is also the\nmid-point of BC.\nSolution :  (i) Consider ∆ AOB and ∆ DOC.\n∠ ABO = ∠ DCO\n(Alternate angles as AB || CD\n     and BC is the transversal)\n∠ AOB = ∠ DOC\n(Vertically opposite angles)\nOA = OD (Given)\nTherefore, ∆AOB ≅∆DOC (AAS rule)\n(ii) OB = OC (CPCT)\nSo, O is the mid-point of BC.\nEXERCISE 7.1\n1.In quadrilateral ACBD,\nAC = AD and AB bisects ∠A\n(see Fig. 7.16).

Let us\nnow apply these results to study some properties related to a triangle whose two sides\nare equal.Fig. 7.22\nFig. 7.23Fig. 7.21\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 95\nPerform the activity given below:\nConstruct a triangle in which two sides are\nequal, say each equal to 3.5 cm and the third side\nequal to 5 cm (see Fig. 7.24). You have done such\nconstructions in earlier classes.\nDo you remember what is such a triangle\ncalled?\nA triangle in which two sides are equal is called\nan isosceles triangle . So, ∆ ABC of Fig. 7.24 is\nan isosceles triangle with AB = AC.\nNow , measure ∠ B and ∠ C. What do you observe?\nRepeat this activity with other isosceles triangles with different sides.\nYou may observe that in each such triangle, the angles opposite to the equal sides\nare equal.\nThis is a very important result and is indeed true for any isosceles triangle. It can\nbe proved as shown below .\nTheor em 7.2 :  Angles opposite to equal sides of an isosceles triangle ar e equal.\nThis result can be proved in many ways. One of\nthe proofs is given here.\nProof :  We are given an isosceles triangle ABC\nin which AB = AC. We need to prove that\n∠ B = ∠ C.\nLet us draw the bisector of ∠ A and let D be\nthe point of intersection of this bisector of\n∠ A and BC (see Fig. 7.25).\nIn ∆ BAD and ∆ CAD,\nAB = AC (Given)\n∠ BAD = ∠ CAD (By construction)\nAD = AD (Common)\nSo, ∆ BAD ≅∆ CAD (By SAS rule)\nSo, ∠ ABD = ∠ ACD, since they are corresponding angles of congruent triangles.\nSo, ∠ B =∠ CFig. 7.24\nFig. 7.25\nReprint 2025-26\n\n96 MATHEMA TICS\nIs the converse also true? That is:\nIf two angles of any triangle are equal, can we conclude that the sides opposite to\nthem are also equal?\nPerform the following activity .\nConstruct a triangle ABC with BC of any length and ∠ B = ∠ C = 50°. Draw the\nbisector of ∠ A and let it intersect BC at D (see Fig. 7.26).\nCut out the triangle from the sheet of paper and fold it along AD so that vertex C\nfalls on vertex B.\nWhat can you say about sides AC and AB?\nObserve that AC covers AB completely\nSo, AC = AB\nRepeat this activity with some more triangles.\nEach time you will observe that the sides opposite\nto equal angles are equal. So we have the\nfollowing:\nTheor em 7.3 : The sides opposite to equal angles of a triangle ar e equal .\nThis is the converse of Theorem 7.2.\nYou can prove this theorem by ASA  congruence rule.\nLet us take some examples to apply these results.\nExample 4 :  In ∆ ABC, the bisector AD of ∠ A is perpendicular to side BC\n(see Fig. 7.27). Show that AB = AC and ∆ ABC is isosceles.\nSolution :  In ∆ABD and ∆ACD,\n∠ BAD = ∠ CAD (Given)\nAD = AD (Common)\n∠ ADB = ∠ ADC = 90° (Given)\nSo, ∆ ABD ≅∆ ACD (ASA rule)\nSo, AB = AC (CPCT)\nor,∆ ABC is an isosceles triangle.Fig. 7.26\nFig. 7.27\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 97\nExample 5 :  E and F are respectively the mid-points\nof equal sides AB and AC of ∆ ABC (see Fig. 7.28).\nShow that BF = CE.\nSolution :  In ∆ ABF and ∆ ACE,\nAB = AC (Given)\n∠ A =∠ A (Common)\nAF = AE (Halves of equal sides)\nSo, ∆ ABF ≅∆ ACE (SAS rule)\nTherefore, BF = CE (CPCT)\nExample 6 :  In an isosceles triangle ABC with AB = AC, D and E are points on BC\nsuch that BE = CD (see Fig. 7.29). Show that AD = AE.\nSolution :  In ∆ ABD and ∆ ACE,\nAB = AC (Given) (1)\n∠ B = ∠ C\n(Angles opposite to equal sides)   (2)\nAlso, BE = CD\nSo, BE – DE = CD – DE\nThat is, BD = CE (3)\nSo, ∆ ABD ≅∆ ACE\n(Using (1), (2), (3) and SAS rule).\nThis gives AD = AE (CPCT)\nEXERCISE 7.2\n1.In an isosceles triangle ABC, with AB = AC, the bisectors of ∠ B and ∠ C intersect\neach other at O.

You\nmay wonder whether equality of three sides of one triangle to three sides of another\ntriangle is enough for congruence of the two triangles. You have already verified in\nearlier classes that this is indeed true.\nTo be sure, construct two triangles with sides 4 cm, 3.5 cm and 4.5 cm\n(see Fig. 7.35). Cut them out and place them on each other . What do you observe?\nThey cover each other completely , if the equal sides are placed on each other . So, the\ntriangles are congruent.\nFig. 7.35\nRepeat this activity with some more triangles. We arrive at another rule for\ncongruence.\nTheor em 7.4  (SSS congruence rule) :  If thr ee sides of one triangle ar e equal to\nthe thr ee sides of another triangle, then the two triangles ar e congr uent.\nThis theorem can be proved using a suitable construction.\nYou have already seen that in the SAS congruence rule, the pair of equal angles\nhas to be the included angle between the pairs of corresponding pair of equal sides and\nif this is not so, the two triangles may not  be congruent.\nPerform this activity:\nConstruct two right angled triangles with hypotenuse equal to 5 cm and one side\nequal to 4 cm each (see Fig. 7.36).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n100 MATHEMA TICS\nFig. 7.36\nCut them out and place one triangle over the other with equal side placed on each\nother . Turn the  triangles, if necessary . What do you observe?\nThe two triangles cover each other completely and so they are congruent. Repeat\nthis activity with other pairs of right triangles. What do you observe?\nYou will find that two right triangles are congruent if one pair of sides and the\nhypotenuse are equal. You have verified this in earlier classes.\nNote that, the right angle is not the included angle in this case.\nSo, you arrive at the following congruence rule:\nTheorem 7.5  (RHS congruence rule) :  If in two right triangles the hypotenuse\nand one side of one triangle ar e equal to the hypotenuse and one side of the\nother triangle, then the two triangles ar e congr uent.\nNote that RHS stands for Right angle - Hypotenuse - Side.\nLet us now take some examples.\nExample 7 :  AB is a line-segment. P  and Q are\npoints on opposite sides of AB such that each of them\nis equidistant from the points A and B (see Fig. 7.37).\nShow that the line PQ is the perpendicular bisector\nof AB.\nSolution :  You are given that P A = PB and\nQA = QB and you are to show that PQ ⊥ AB and\nPQ bisects AB. Let PQ intersect AB at C.\nCan you think of two congruent triangles in this figure?\nLet us take ∆ PAQ and ∆ PBQ.\nIn these triangles,Fig. 7.37\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIANGLES 101\nAP = BP  (Given)\nAQ = BQ  (Given)\nPQ = PQ  (Common)\nSo, ∆ PAQ ≅∆ PBQ (SSS rule)\nTherefore, ∠ APQ = ∠ BPQ (CPCT).\nNow let us consider ∆PAC and ∆PBC.\nYou have : AP = BP (Given)\n∠ APC = ∠ BPC (∠ APQ = ∠ BPQ proved above)\nPC = PC (Common)\nSo, ∆ PAC ≅∆ PBC (SAS rule)\nTherefore, AC = BC (CPCT) (1)\nand ∠ ACP = ∠ BCP (CPCT)\nAlso, ∠ ACP + ∠ BCP = 180° (Linear pair)\nSo, 2∠ ACP  = 180°\nor, ∠ ACP  = 90° (2)\nFrom (1) and (2), you can easily conclude that PQ is the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n[Note that, without showing the congruence of ∆PAQ and ∆PBQ, you cannot show\nthat ∆PAC ≅ ∆PBC even though AP = BP (Given)\nPC = PC  (Common)\nand ∠ PAC = ∠ PBC (Angles opposite to equal sides in\n∆APB)\nIt is because these results give us SSA rule which is not always valid or true for\ncongruence of triangles. Also the angle is not included between the equal pairs of\nsides.]\nLet us take some more examples.\nExample 8 :  P is a point equidistant from two lines l and m intersecting at point A\n(see Fig. 7.38). Show that the line AP bisects the angle between them.\nSolution :  You are given that lines l and m intersect  each other at A. Let PB ⊥ \nl,\nPC ⊥ m.

You already know that whatever is given\nin a theorem, the same is to be proved in the converse and whatever is proved in the\ntheorem it is given in the converse. Thus, Theorem 8.2 can be stated as given below :\nIf a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal. So\nits converse is :\nTheorem 8.3 :  If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it\nis a parallelogram .\nCan you reason out why?\nLet sides AB and CD of the quadrilateral ABCD\nbe equal and also  AD = BC (see Fig. 8.3). Draw\ndiagonal AC.\nClearly , ∆ ABC ≅∆ CDA (Why?)\nSo, ∠ BAC = ∠ DCA\nand ∠ BCA = ∠ DAC (Why?)\nCan you now say that ABCD is a parallelogram? Why?Fig. 8.2\nFig. 8.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n106 MATHEMA TICS\nYou have just seen that in a parallelogram each pair of opposite sides is equal and\nconversely if each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it is a\nparallelogram. Can we conclude the same result for the pairs of opposite angles?\nDraw a parallelogram and measure its angles. What do you observe?\nEach pair of opposite angles is equal.\nRepeat this with some more parallelograms. We arrive at yet another result as\ngiven below .\nTheor em 8.4 :  In a parallelogram, opposite angles ar e equal .\nNow , is the converse of this result also true? Yes. Using the angle sum property of\na quadrilateral and the results of parallel lines intersected by a transversal, we can see\nthat the converse is also true. So, we have the following theorem :\nTheorem 8.5 :  If in a quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is equal, then\nit is a parallelogram .\nThere is yet another property of a parallelogram. Let us study the same. Draw a\nparallelogram ABCD and draw both its diagonals intersecting at the point O\n(see Fig. 8.4).\nMeasure the lengths of OA, OB, OC and OD.\nWhat do you observe? You will observe that\nOA = OC and OB = OD.\nor,O is the mid-point of both the diagonals.\nRepeat this activity with some more parallelograms.\nEach time you will find that O is the mid-point of\nboth the diagonals.\nSo, we have the following theorem :\nTheor em 8.6 :  The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other .\nNow , what would happen, if in a quadrilateral the diagonals bisect each other?\nWill it be aparallelogram? Indeed this is true.\nThis result is the converse of the result of Theorem 8.6. It is given below:\nTheor em 8.7 :  If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other , then it is a\nparallelogram .\nYou can reason out this result as follows:Fig. 8.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nQUADRILA TERALS 107\nNote that in Fig. 8.5, it is given that OA = OC\nand OB = OD.\nSo,          ∆ AOB ≅ ∆ COD (Why?)\nTherefore, ∠ ABO = ∠ CDO (Why?)\nFrom this, we get AB || CD\nSimilarly ,         BC || AD\nTherefore ABCD is a parallelogram.\nLet us now take some examples.\nExample 1 :  Show that each angle of a rectangle is a right angle.\nSolution :  Let us recall what a rectangle is.\nA rectangle is a parallelogram in which one angle is a right angle.\n Let ABCD be a rectangle in which ∠ A = 90°.\nWe have to show that ∠ B = ∠ C = ∠ D = 90°\nWe have, AD || BC and AB is a transversal\n(see Fig. 8.6).\nSo, ∠ A + ∠ B = 180° (Interior angles on the same\n side of the transversal)\nBut, ∠ A =90°\nSo, ∠ B = 180° – ∠ A = 180° – 90° = 90°\nNow, ∠ C = ∠ Aand ∠ D = ∠ B\n(Opposite angles of the parallellogram)\nSo, ∠ C = 90° and ∠ D = 90°.\nTherefore, each of the angles of a rectangle is a right angle.\nExample 2 :  Show that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other .\nSolution :  Consider the rhombus ABCD (see Fig. 8.7).\nYou know that  AB = BC = CD = DA  (Why?)\nNow , in ∆ AOD and ∆ COD,\nOA = OC (Diagonals of a parallelogram\nbisect each other)\nOD = OD (Common)\nAD = CDFig. 8.5\nFig. 8.6\nFig. 8.7\nReprint 2025-26\n\n108 MATHEMA TICS\nTherefore, ∆ AOD ≅ ∆ COD\n(SSS congruence rule)\nThis gives, ∠ AOD = ∠ COD (CPCT)\nBut, ∠ AOD + ∠ COD = 180° (Linear pair)\nSo, 2∠ AOD = 180°\nor, ∠ AOD = 90°\nSo, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other .\nExample 3 :  ABC is an isosceles triangle in which AB = AC. AD bisects exterior\nangle P AC and CD || AB (see Fig. 8.8). Show that\n(i) ∠ DAC = ∠ BCA and (ii) ABCD is a parallelogram.\nSolution :  (i) ∆ ABC is isosceles in which AB = AC (Given)\nSo, ∠ ABC = ∠ ACB (Angles opposite to equal sides)\nAlso, ∠ PAC = ∠ ABC + ∠ ACB\n(Exterior angle of a triangle)\nor, ∠ PAC = 2∠ ACB (1)\nNow , AD bisects ∠ PAC.\nSo, ∠ PAC = 2∠ DAC (2)\nTherefore,\n2∠ DAC = 2∠ ACB [From (1) and (2)]\nor, ∠ DAC = ∠ ACB\n(ii) Now , these equal angles form a pair of alternate angles when line segments BC\nand AD are intersected by a transversal AC.\nSo, BC || AD\nAlso, BA || CD (Given)\nNow , both pairs of opposite sides of quadrilateral ABCD are parallel.\nSo, ABCD is a parallelogram.\nExample 4 :  Two parallel lines l \nand m are intersected by a transversal p\n(see Fig. 8.9).

Similarly , ∠ PQR = 90° and ∠ SRQ = 90°.\nSo, PQRS is a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles.\nCan we conclude that it is a rectangle? Let us examine. We have shown that\n∠ PSR = ∠ PQR = 90° and ∠ SPQ = ∠ SRQ = 90°. So both pairs of opposite angles\nare equal.\nTherefore, PQRS is a parallelogram in which one angle (in fact all angles) is 90° and\nso, PQRS is a rectangle.\nEXERCISE 8.1\n1.If the diagonals of a parallelogram are equal, then show that it is a rectangle.\n2.Show that the diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at right angles.\n3.Diagonal AC of a parallelogram ABCD bisects\n∠ A (see Fig. 8.1 1).

Join PR and QR\n(see Fig. 9.1). Then  ∠ PRQ is called the angle subtended by the line segment PQ at\nthe point R. What are angles POQ, PRQ and PSQ called in Fig. 9.2? ∠ POQ is the\nangle subtended by the chord PQ at the centre O, ∠ PRQ and ∠ \nPSQ are respectively\nthe angles subtended by PQ at points R and S on the major and minor arcs PQ.\nFig. 9.1             Fig. 9.2\nLet us examine the relationship between the size of the chord and the angle\nsubtended by it at the centre. You may see by drawing dif ferent chords of a circle\nand  angles subtended by them at the centre that the longer is the chord, the bigger\nwill be the angle subtended by it at the centre. What will happen if you take two\nequal chords of a circle? Will the angles subtended at the centre be the same\nor not?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 117\nDraw two or more equal chords of a circle and\nmeasure the angles subtended by them at the centre\n(see Fig.9.3). You will find that the angles subtended\nby them at the centre are equal. Let us give a proof\nof this fact.\nTheor em 9.1 :  Equal chor ds of a cir cle subtend\nequal angles at the centr e.\nProof :  You are given two equal chords AB and CD\nof a circle with centre O (see Fig.9.4). \nYou want to\nprove that ∠ AOB = ∠ COD.\nIn triangles AOB and COD,\nOA = OC (Radii of a circle)\nOB = OD (Radii of a circle)\nAB = CD (Given)\nTherefore, ∆ AOB ≅∆ COD (SSS rule)\nThis gives ∠ AOB = ∠ COD\n               (Corresponding parts of congruent triangles)\nRemark :  For convenience, the abbreviation CPCT will be used in place of\n‘Corresponding parts of congruent triangles’, because we use this very frequently as\nyou will see.\nNow if two chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre, what can you\nsay about the chords? Are they equal or not? Let us examine this by the following\nactivity:\nTake a tracing paper and trace a circle on it. Cut\nit along the circle to get a disc. At its centre O, draw\nan angle AOB where A, B are points on the circle.\nMake another angle POQ at the centre equal to\n∠AOB. Cut the disc along AB and PQ\n(see Fig. 9.5). You will get two segments ACB and\nPRQ of the circle. If you put one on the other , what\ndo you observe? They cover each other , i.e., they\nare congruent. So AB  = PQ.Fig. 9.3\nFig. 9.4\nFig. 9.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\n118 MATHEMA TICS\nThough you have seen it for this particular case, try it out for other equal angles\ntoo. The chords will all turn out to be equal because of the following theorem:\nTheor em 9.2 :  If the angles subtended by the chor ds of a cir cle at the centr e are\nequal, then the chor ds ar e equal.\nThe above theorem is the converse of the Theorem 9.1. Note that in Fig. 9.4, if\nyou take ∠ AOB = ∠ COD, then\n           ∆  AOB ≅ ∆ COD (Why?)\nCan you now see that AB = CD?\nEXERCISE 9.1\n1.Recall that two circles are congruent if they have the same radii. Prove that equal\nchords of congruent circles subtend equal angles at their centres.\n2.Prove that if chords of congruent circles subtend equal angles at their centres, then\nthe chords are equal.\n9.2 Perpendicular from the Centre to a Chord\nActivity :  Draw a circle on a tracing paper . Let O\nbe its centre. Draw a chord AB. Fold the paper along\na line through O so that a portion of the chord falls on\nthe other . Let the crease cut AB at the point M. Then,\n∠ OMA = ∠ OMB = 90° or OM is perpendicular to\nAB. Does the point B coincide with A (see Fig.9.6)?\nYes it will. So MA  = MB.\nGive a proof yourself by joining OA and OB and proving the right triangles OMA\nand OMB to be congruent. This example is a particular instance of the following\nresult:\nTheor em 9.3 :  The perpendicular fr om the centr e of a cir cle to a chor d bisects\nthe chor d.\nWhat is the converse of this theorem? To write this, first let us be clear what is\nassumed in Theorem 9.3 and what is proved. Given that the perpendicular from the\ncentre of a circle to a chord is drawn and to prove that it bisects the chord. Thus in the\nconverse, what the hypothesis is ‘if a line from the centre bisects a chord of a\ncircle’ and what is to be proved is ‘the line is perpendicular to the chord’. So the\nconverse is:Fig. 9.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 119\nTheor em 9.4 :  The line drawn thr ough the centr e of a cir cle to bisect a chor d is\nperpendicular to the chor d.\nIs this  true? Try it for few cases and see. You will\nsee that it is true for these cases. See if it is true, in\ngeneral, by doing the following exercise. We will write\nthe stages and you give the reasons.\nLet AB be a chord of a circle with centre O and\nO is joined to the mid-point M of AB. You have to\nprove that OM ⊥ AB. Join OA  and OB\n(see Fig. 9.7). In triangles OAM and OBM,\nOA = OB (Why ?)\nAM = BM (Why ?)\nOM = OM (Common)\nTherefore, ∆OAM ≅∆OBM (How ?)\nThis gives ∠OMA = ∠OMB = 90°    (Why ?)\n9.3 Equal Chords and their Distances from the Centre\nLet AB be a line and P  be a point. Since there are\ninfinite numbers of points on a line, if you join these\npoints to P , you will get infinitely many line segments\nPL1, PL2, PM, PL3, PL4, etc. Which of these is the\ndistance of AB from P? You may think a while and\nget the answer . Out of these line segments, the\nperpendicular from P  to AB, namely PM in Fig. 9.8,\nwill be the least. In Mathematics, we define this least\nlength PM to be the distance of AB fr om P\n. So you\nmay say that:\nThe length of the perpendicular fr om a point to a line is the distance of the\nline fr om the point .\nNote that if the point lies on the line, the distance of the line from the point is zero.\nA circle can have infinitely many chords. You may observe by drawing chords of\na circle that longer chord is nearer to the centre than the smaller chord. You may\nobserve it by drawing several chords of a circle of different lengths and measuring\ntheir distances from the centre.  What is the distance of the diameter , which is theFig. 9.7\nFig. 9.8\nReprint 2025-26\n\n120 MATHEMA TICS\nlongest chord from the centre? Since the centre lies on it, the distance is zero. Do you\nthink that there is some relationship between the length of chords and their distances\nfrom the centre? Let us see if this is so.\nFig. 9.9\nActivity :  Draw a circle of any radius on a tracing paper . Draw two equal chords\nAB and CD of it and also the perpendiculars OM and ON on them from the centre\nO. Fold the figure so that D falls on B and C falls on A [see Fig.9.9 (i)]. You may\nobserve that O lies on the crease and N falls on M. Therefore, OM = ON. Repeat\nthe activity by drawing congruent circles with centres O and O ′ and taking equal\nchords AB and CD one on each. Draw perpendiculars OM and O ′N on them [see\nFig. 9.9(ii)]. Cut one circular disc and put it on the other so that AB coincides with\nCD. Then you will find that O coincides with O ′ and M coincides with N. In this\nway you verified the following:\nTheor em 9.5 :  Equal chor ds of a cir cle (or of congr uent cir cles) are equidistant\nfrom the centr e (or centr es).\nNext, it will be seen whether the converse of this theorem is true or not. For\nthis, draw a circle with centre O. From the centre O, draw two line segments OL\nand OM of equal length and lying inside the circle [see Fig. 9.10(i)]. Then draw\nchords PQ and RS of the circle perpendicular to OL and OM respectively [see Fig\n9.10(ii)]. Measure the lengths of PQ and RS. Are these dif ferent? No, both are\nequal. Repeat the activity for more equal line segments and drawing the chords\nperpendicular to them. This verifies the converse of the Theorem 9.5 which is stated\nas follows:\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 121\nTheor em 9.6 :  Chor ds equidistant fr om the centr e of a cir cle ar e equal in length.\nWe now take an example to illustrate the use of the above results:\nExample 1 :  If two intersecting chords of a circle make equal angles with the diameter\npassing through their point of intersection, prove that the chords are equal.\nSolution :  Given that AB and CD are two chords of\na circle, with centre O intersecting at a point E.

Find the length of the common chord.\n2.If two equal chords of a circle intersect within the circle, prove that the segments of\none chord are equal to corresponding segments of the other chord.\n3.If two equal chords of a circle intersect within the circle, prove that the line\njoining the point of intersection to the centre makes equal angles with the chords.\n4.If a line intersects two concentric circles (circles\nwith the same centre) with centre O at A, B, C and\nD, prove that AB = CD (see Fig. 9.12).\n5.Three girls Reshma, Salma and Mandip are\nplaying a game by standing on a circle of radius\n5m drawn in a park. Reshma throws a ball to\nSalma, Salma to Mandip, Mandip to Reshma. If\nthe distance between Reshma and Salma and\nbetween Salma and Mandip is 6m each, what is\nthe distance between Reshma and Mandip?\n6. A circular park of radius 20m is situated in a colony . Three boys Ankur , Syed and\nDavid are sitting at equal distance on its boundary each having a toy telephone in\nhis hands to talk each other . Find the length of the string of each phone.\n9.4 Angle Subtended by an Arc of a Cir cle\nYou have seen that the end points of a chord other than diameter of a circle cuts it into\ntwo arcs – one major and other minor . If you take two equal chords, what can you say\nabout the size of arcs? Is one arc made by first chord equal to the corresponding arc\nmade by another chord? In fact, they are more than just equal in length. They are\ncongruent in the sense that if one arc is put on the other , without bending or twisting,\none superimposes the other completely .\nYou can verify this fact by cutting the arc,\ncorresponding to the chord CD from the circle along\nCD and put it on the corresponding arc made by equal\nchord AB. You will find that the arc CD superimpose\nthe arc AB completely  (see Fig. 9.13). This shows\nthat equal chords make congruent arcs and\nconversely congruent arcs make equal chords of a\ncircle. You can state it as follows:\nIf two chor ds of a cir cle ar e equal, then their cor responding ar cs ar e congr uent\nand conversely , if two ar cs ar e congr uent, then their cor responding chor ds ar e equal.Fig. 9.12\nFig. 9.13\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 123\nAlso the angle subtended by an arc at the centre\nis defined to be angle subtended by the corresponding\nchord at the centre in the sense that the minor arc\nsubtends the angle and the major arc subtends the\nreflex angle. Therefore, in Fig 9.14, the angle\nsubtended by the minor arc PQ at O is ∠POQ and\nthe angle subtended by the major arc PQ at O is\nreflex angle POQ.\n In view of the property above and Theorem 9.1,\nthe following result is true:\nCongr uent ar cs (or equal ar cs) of a cir cle subtend equal angles at the centr e.\nTherefore, the angle subtended by a chord of a circle at its centre is equal to the\nangle subtended by the corresponding (minor) arc at the centre. The following theorem\ngives the relationship between the angles subtended by an arc at the centre and at a\npoint on the circle.\nTheor em 9.7 :  The angle subtended by an ar c at the centr e is double the angle\nsubtended by it at any point on the r emaining par t of the cir cle.\nProof :  Given an arc PQ of a circle subtending angles POQ at the centre O and\nPAQ at a point A on the remaining part of the circle. We need to prove that\n∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PAQ.\nFig. 9.15\nConsider the three different cases as given in Fig. 9.15. In (i), arc PQ is minor; in (ii),\narc PQ is a semicircle and in (iii), arc PQ is major .\nLet us begin by joining AO and extending it to a point B.\nIn all the cases,\n∠ BOQ = ∠ OAQ + ∠ AQO\nbecause an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite\nangles.Fig. 9.14\nReprint 2025-26\n\n124 MATHEMA TICS\nAlso in ∆ OAQ,\nOA = OQ (Radii of a circle)\nTherefore, ∠ OAQ = ∠ OQA (Theorem 7.5)\nThis gives ∠ BOQ = 2 ∠ OAQ (1)\nSimilarly , ∠ BOP = 2 ∠ OAP (2)\nFrom (1) and (2), ∠ BOP + ∠ BOQ = 2(∠ OAP + ∠ OAQ)\nThis is the same as ∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PAQ (3)\nFor the case (iii), where PQ is the major arc, (3) is replaced by\nreflex angle POQ = 2 ∠ PAQ\nRemark :  Suppose we join points P and Q and\nform a chord PQ in the above figures. Then\n∠ PAQ is also called the angle formed in the\nsegment P AQP .\nIn Theorem 9.7, A can be any point on the\nremaining part of the circle. So if you take any\nother point C on the remaining part of the circle\n(see Fig. 9.16), you have\n∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PCQ = 2 ∠ PAQ\nTherefore, ∠ PCQ = ∠ PAQ.\nThis proves the following:\nTheor em 9.8 :  Angles in the same segment of a cir cle ar e equal.\nAgain let us discuss the case (ii) of Theorem 10.8 separately . Here ∠PAQ is an angle\nin the segment, which is a semicircle. Also, ∠ PAQ = 1\n2 ∠ POQ = 1\n2 × 180° = 90°.\nIf you take any other point C on the semicircle, again you get that\n∠ PCQ = 90°\nTherefore, you find another property of the circle as:\nAngle in a semicir cle is a right angle.\nThe converse of Theorem 9.8 is also true. It can be stated as:\nTheorem 9.9 :  If a line segment joining two points subtends equal angles at two\nother points lying on the same side of the line containing the line segment, the\nfour points lie on a cir cle (i.e. they ar e concyclic ).Fig. 9.16\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 125\nYou can see the truth of this result as follows:\nIn Fig. 9.17, AB is a line segment, which subtends equal angles at two points C and D.\nThat is\n∠ ACB =  ∠ ADB\nTo show that the points A, B, C and D lie on a circle\nlet us draw a circle through the points A, C and B.\nSuppose it does not pass through the point D. Then it\nwill intersect AD (or extended AD) at a point, say E\n(or E ′).\nIf points A, C, E and B lie on a circle,\n∠ ACB = ∠ AEB (Why?)\nBut it is given that ∠ ACB = ∠ ADB.\nTherefore, ∠ AEB = ∠ ADB.\nThis is not possible unless E coincides with D. (Why?)\nSimilarly , E′ should also coincide with D.\n9.5 Cyclic Quadrilaterals\nA quadrilateral ABCD is called cyclic  if all the four vertices\nof it lie on a circle (see Fig 9.18). You will find a peculiar\nproperty in such quadrilaterals. Draw several cyclic\nquadrilaterals of different sides and name each of these\nas ABCD. (This can be done by drawing several circles\nof different radii and taking four points on each of them.)\nMeasure the opposite angles and write your observations\nin the following table.\n  S.No. of Quadrilateral ∠ A ∠ B ∠ C ∠ D ∠ A +∠ C∠ B +∠ D\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\nWhat do you infer from the table?Fig. 9.17\nFig. 9.18\nReprint 2025-26\n\n126 MATHEMA TICS\nYou find that ∠A + ∠C = 180° and ∠B + ∠D = 180°, neglecting the error in\nmeasurements. This verifies the following:\nTheorem 9.10 :  The sum of either pair of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral\nis 180º.\nIn fact, the converse of this theorem, which is stated below is also true.\nTheor em 9.1 1 : If the sum of a pair of opposite angles of a quadrilateral is 180º,\nthe quadrilateral is cyclic.\nYou can see the truth of this theorem by following a method similar to the method\nadopted for Theorem 9.9.\nExample 2 :  In Fig. 9.19, AB is a diameter of the circle, CD is a chord equal to the\nradius of the circle. AC and BD when extended intersect at a point E. Prove that\n∠ AEB = 60°.\nSolution :  Join OC, OD and BC.\nTriangle ODC is equilateral (Why?)\nTherefore, ∠ COD = 60°\nNow, ∠ CBD  =1\n2 ∠ COD (Theorem 9.7)\nThis gives ∠ CBD = 30°\nAgain, ∠ ACB = 90° (Why ?)\nSo, ∠ BCE = 180° – ∠ ACB = 90°\nWhich gives ∠ CEB = 90° – 30° = 60°, i.e., ∠ AEB = 60°\nExample 3 :  In Fig 9.20, ABCD is a cyclic\nquadrilateral in which AC and BD are its diagonals.\nIf ∠ DBC = 55° and ∠ BAC = 45°, find ∠ BCD.\nSolution : ∠ CAD = ∠ DBC = 55°\n(Angles in the same segment)\nTherefore, ∠ DAB = ∠ CAD + ∠ BAC\n=55° + 45° = 100°\nBut ∠ DAB + ∠ BCD = 180°\n(Opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral)\nSo, ∠ BCD = 180° – 100° = 80°Fig. 9.19\nFig. 9.20\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCIRCLES 127\nExample 4 :  Two circles intersect at two points A\nand B. AD and AC are diameters to the two circles\n(see Fig. 9.21). Prove that B lies on the line segment\nDC.\nSolution :  Join AB.\n∠ ABD = 90° (Angle in a semicircle)\n∠ ABC = 90° (Angle in a semicircle)\nSo, ∠ ABD + ∠ ABC = 90° + 90° = 180°\nTherefore, DBC is a line. That is B lies on the line segment DC.\nExample 5 :  Prove that the quadrilateral formed (if possible) by the internal angle\nbisectors of any quadrilateral is cyclic.\nSolution :  In Fig. 9.22, ABCD is a quadrilateral in\nwhich the angle bisectors AH, BF , CF and DH of\ninternal angles A, B, C and D respectively form a\nquadrilateral EFGH.\nNow , ∠ FEH = ∠ AEB = 180° – ∠ EAB – ∠ EBA (Why ?)\n           = 180° – 1\n2 (∠ A + ∠ B)\nand ∠ FGH = ∠ CGD = 180 ° – ∠ GCD – ∠ GDC (Why ?)\n                      = 180° – 1\n2 (∠ C + ∠ D)\nTherefore, ∠ FEH + ∠ FGH = 180 ° – 1\n2 (∠ A + ∠ B) + 180 ° – 1\n2 (∠ C + ∠ D)\n                 = 360 ° – 1\n2 (∠ A+ ∠ B +∠ C +∠ D) = 360 ° – 1\n2 × 360°\n                 = 360° – 180° = 180°\nTherefore, by Theorem 9.1 1, the quadrilateral EFGH is cyclic.\nEXERCISE 9.3\n1.In Fig. 9.23, A,B and C are three points on a circle\nwith centre  O such that ∠ BOC = 30° and\n∠ AOB = 60°.

Living beings\nhave to per form several basic activities to\nsurvive.  W e call such activities ‘life pr ocesses’.\nThe ener gy for these pr ocesses comes fr om\nfood. W e need ener gy for other activities like\nplaying, singing, r eading, writing, thinking,\njumping, cycling and running.  Activities that\nare strenuous r\nequir e more ener gy.\nAnimals too get engaged in activities.  For\nexample, they may jump and run.  They have\nto fight, move away fr om enemies, find food\nor find a safe place to live. Also, we engage\nsome animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull\ncarts or plough fields.  All such activities\nrequir e ener gy.\nThink of machines. List the machines that\nyou have come across. What do they need for\ntheir working? Why do some engines r equir e\nfuel like petr ol and diesel?  Why do living\nbeings and machines need energy?\n10.1Work\nWhat is work? There is a dif ference in the\nway we use the ter m ‘work’ in day-to-day life\nand the way we use it in science.  T o make\nthis point clear let us consider a few examples.\n10.1.1 NOT MUCH  ‘WORK ’ IN SPITE OF\nWORKING  HARD !\nKamali is pr eparing for examinations. She\nspends lot of time in studies. She r eads books,draws diagrams, organises her thoughts,\ncollects question papers, attends classes,\ndiscusses pr oblems with her friends, and\nperforms experiments.  She expends a lot of\nenergy on these activities. In common\nparlance, she is ‘working har d’. All this ‘har d\nwork’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by\nthe scientific definition of work.\nYou ar e working har d to push a huge r ock.\nLet us say the r ock does not move despite all\nthe ef fort. Y ou get completely exhausted.\nHowever , you have not done any work on the\nrock as there is no displacement of the r ock.\nYou stand still for a few minutes with a\nheavy load on your head.   Y ou get tired. Y ou\nhave exerted yourself and have spent quite a\nbit of your energy. Ar e you doing work on the\nload?  The way we understand the ter m ‘work’\nin science, work is not done.\nYou climb up the steps of a stair case and\nreach the second floor of a building just to\nsee the landscape fr om ther e.  You may even\nclimb up a tall tr ee.  If we apply the scientific\ndefinition, these activities involve a lot of work.\nIn day-to-day life, we consider any useful\nphysical or mental labour as work. Activities\nlike playing in a field, talking with friends,\nhumming a tune, watching a movie, attending\na function ar e sometimes not consider ed to\nbe work.  What constitutes ‘work’ depends\non the way we define it. W e use and define\nthe ter m work dif ferently in science.  T o\nunderstand this let us do the following\nactivities:\nActivity _____________ 10.1\n•We have discussed in the above\nparagraphs a number of activities\nwhich we nor mally consider to be work10\nW WW WWORK ORKORK ORKORK     AND ANDAND ANDAND E  E E  E ENERGY NERGYNERGY NERGYNERGYChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 114Activity _____________ 10.3\n•Think of situations when the object\nis not displaced in spite of a force\nacting on it.\n•Also think of situations when an object\ngets displaced in the absence of a for ce\nacting on it.\n•List all the situations that you can\nthink of for each.\n•Discuss with your friends whether\nwork is done in these situations.\n10.1.3 WORK DONE  BY A CONSTANT\nFORCE\nHow is work defined in science? T o\nunderstand this, we shall first consider the\ncase when the for ce is acting in the dir ection\nof displacement.\nLet a constant for ce, F\n act on an object.\nLet the object be displaced through a\ndistance, s  in the direction of the force (Fig.\n10.1). Let W be the work done. W e define work\nto be equal to the pr oduct of the for ce and\ndisplacement.\nWork done =force × displacement\nW=F s  (10.1)in day-to-day life. For each of these\nactivities, ask the following questions\nand answer them:\n(i)What is the work being done on?\n(ii)What is happening to the object?\n(iii)Who (what) is doing the work?\n10.1.2 SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION  OF WORK\nTo understand the way we view work and\ndefine work fr om the point of view of science,\nlet us consider some situations:\nPush a pebble lying on a sur face. The\npebble moves thr ough a distance. Y ou exerted\na for ce on the pebble and the pebble got\ndisplaced. In this situation work is done.\nA girl pulls a tr olley and the tr olley moves\nthrough a distance.  The girl has exerted a\nforce on the trolley and it is displaced.\nTherefor e, work is done.\nLift a book thr ough a height. T o do this\nyou must apply a for ce.  The book rises up.\nThere is a for ce applied on the book and the\nbook has moved.  Hence, work is done.\nA closer look at the above situations\nreveals that two conditions need to be\nsatisfied for work to be done: (i) a for ce should\nact on an object, and (ii) the object must be\ndisplaced.\nIf any one of the above conditions does\nnot exist, work is not done. This is the way\nwe view work in science.\nA bullock is pulling a cart.  The cart\nmoves. Ther e is a force on the cart and the\ncart has moved. Do you think that work is\ndone in this situation?\nActivity _____________ 10.2\n•Think of some situations from your\ndaily life involving work.\n•List them.\n•Discuss with your friends whether\nwork is being done in each situation.\n•Try to r eason out your response.\n•If work is done, which is the for ce acting\non the object?\n•What is the object on which the work\nis done?\n•What happens to the object on which\nwork is done?Fig. 10.1\nThus, work done by a force acting on an\nobject is equal to the magnitude of the for ce\nmultiplied by the distance moved in the\ndirection of the for ce. W ork has only\nmagnitude and no dir ection.\nIn Eq. (10.1), if F\n = 1 N and s = 1 m then\nthe work done by the for ce will be 1 N m.\nHere the unit of work is newton metr e (N m)\nor joule  (J).  Thus 1 J is the amount of work\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWORK AND  ENERGY 115done on an object when a for ce of 1 N\ndisplaces it by 1 m along the line of action of\nthe for ce.\nLook at Eq. (10.1) carefully.  What is the\nwork done when the for ce on the object is\nzero? What would be the work done when\nthe displacement of the object is zer o? Refer\nto the conditions that ar e to be satisfied to\nsay that work is done.\nExample  10.1 A force of 5 N is acting on\nan object. The object is displaced\nthrough 2 m in the direction of the force\n(Fig. 10.2). If the force acts on the object\nall through the displacement, then work\ndone is 5 N \n× 2 m  =10 N m or 10 J.Fig. 10.4\nConsider a situation in which an object is\nmoving with a uniform velocity along a\nparticular dir ection. Now a r etarding for ce, F,\nis applied in the opposite direction. That is,\nthe angle between the two directions is 180º.\nLet the object stop after a displacement s. In\nsuch a situation, the work done by the force,\nF is taken as negative and denoted by the\nminus sign. The work done by the force is\nF × (–s) or (–F × s).\nIt is clear from the above discussion that\nthe work done by a for ce can be either positive\nor negative. T o understand this, let us do the\nfollowing activity:\nActivity _____________ 10.4\n•Lift an object up. W ork is done by the\nforce exerted by you on the object.  The\nobject moves upwar ds. The for ce you\nexerted is in the dir ection of\ndisplacement. However , ther e is the\nforce of gravity acting on the object.\n•Which one of these for ces is doing\npositive work?\n•Which one is doing negative work?\n•Give r easons.\nWork done is negative when the for ce acts\nopposite to the dir ection of displacement.\nWork done is positive when the for ce is in the\ndirection of displacement.\nExample  10.2  A porter lifts a luggage of\n15 kg from the ground and puts it on\nhis head 1.5 m above the ground.\nCalculate the work done by him on the\nluggage.\nSolution:\nMass of luggage, m = 15 kg and\ndisplacement, \ns = 1.5 m.Fig. 10.2\nuestion\n1.A force of 7 N acts on an object.\nThe displacement is, say 8 m, in\nthe dir ection of the for ce\n(Fig. 10.3).  Let us take it that the\nforce acts on the object thr ough\nthe displacement. What is the\nwork done in this case?\nFig. 10.3\nConsider another situation in which the\nforce and the displacement are in the same\ndirection:  a baby pulling a toy car parallel to\nthe ground, as shown in Fig. 10.4.  The baby\nhas exerted a for ce in the dir ection of\ndisplacement of the car . In this situation, the\nwork done will be equal to the pr oduct of the\nforce and displacement. In such situations,\nthe work done by the force is taken as positive.Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 116raised hammer falls on a nail placed on a piece\nof wood, it drives the nail into the wood . We\nhave also observed children winding a toy\n(such as a toy car) and when the toy is placed\non the floor , it starts moving. When a balloon\nis filled with air and we press it we notice a\nchange in its shape. As long as we press it\ngently, it can come back to its original shape\nwhen the for ce is withdrawn. However , if we\npress the balloon hard, it can even explode\nproducing a blasting sound. In all these\nexamples, the objects  acquire, through\ndifferent means, the capability of\n doing work.\nAn object having a capability to do work is\nsaid to possess ener gy. The object which does\nthe work loses ener gy and the object on which\nthe work is done gains ener gy.\nHow does an object with ener gy do work?\nAn object that possesses ener gy can exert a\nforce on another object. When this happens,\nenergy is transferred fr om the for mer to the\nlatter . The second object may move as it\nreceives ener gy and ther efore do some work.\nThus, the first object had a capacity  to do\nwork. This implies that any object that\npossesses ener gy can do work.\nThe energy possessed by a n object  is thus\nmeasur ed in  terms of  its  capacity of doing\nwork. The unit of ener gy is, ther efore, the same\nas that of work , that is, joule (J).  1 J is the\nenergy requir ed to do 1 joule of work.\nSometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo\njoule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J.\n10.2.1 FORMS  OF ENERGY\nLuckily the world we live in provides energy in\nmany different forms.  The various forms\ninclude mechanical ener gy (potential energy\n+ kinetic ener gy), heat ener gy, chemical\nenergy, electrical ener gy and light energy.\nThink it over !\nHow do you know that some entity is a\nform of ener gy? Discuss with your friends\nand teachers.Work done, W = F × s = mg × s\n=15 kg × 10 m s-2 × 1.5 m\n=225 kg m s-2 m\n=225 N m =  225 J\nWork done is 225 J.\nuestions\n1.When do we say that work is\ndone?\n2.Write an expr ession for the work\ndone when a for ce is acting on\nan object in the direction of its\ndisplacement.\n3.Define 1 J  of work.\n4.A pair of bullocks exerts a for ce\nof 140 N on a plough.

Where do we\nget ener gy fr om? The Sun is the biggest\nnatural sour ce of ener gy to us. Many of our\nenergy sources ar e derived fr om the Sun.  W e\ncan also get energy fr om the nuclei of atoms,\nthe interior of the earth, and the tides.  Can\nyou think of other sour ces of ener gy?\nActivity _____________ 10.5\n•A few sources of energy are listed\nabove. There are many other sources\nof energy. List them.\n•Discuss in small gr oups how certain\nsources of ener gy ar e due to the Sun.\n•Are ther e sour ces of ener gy which ar e\nnot due to the Sun?\nThe wor d ener gy is very often used in our\ndaily life, but in science we give it a definite\nand pr ecise meaning. Let us consider the\nfollowing examples: when a fast moving\ncricket ball hits a stationary wicket, the wicket\nis thr own away. Similarly, an object when\nraised to a certain height gets the capability\nto do work. Y ou must have seen that when aQ\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWORK AND  ENERGY 117Fig. 10.5\n•The trolley moves forward and hits the\nwooden block.\n•Fix a stop on the table in such a\nmanner that the tr olley stops after\nhitting the block.

In which case is the\ndisplacement mor e?\n•In which case is the work done mor e?\n•In this activity, the moving tr olley does\nwork and hence it possesses ener gy.\nA moving object can do work.  An object\nmoving faster can do mor e work than an\nidentical object moving r elatively slow. A\nmoving bullet, blowing wind, a r otating wheel,\na speeding stone can do work. How does a\nbullet pier\nce the target? How does the wind\nmove the blades of a windmill?  Objects in\nmotion possess energy. W e call this ener gy\nkinetic ener gy.\nA falling coconut, a speeding car , a rolling\nstone, a flying air craft, flowing water , blowing\nwind, a running athlete etc. possess kinetic\nenergy.  In short, kinetic ener gy is the energy\npossessed by an object due to its motion. The\nkinetic energy of an object increases with its\nspeed.\nHow much ener gy is possessed by a\nmoving body by virtue of its motion?

Consider\nan object of mass, m moving with a unifor m\nvelocity, u. Let it now be displaced thr ough a\ndistance s   \n  when a constant for ce, F acts on it\nin the dir ection of its displacement.  Fr om\nEq. (10.1), the work done, W\n is F s. The work\ndone on the object will cause a change in its\nvelocity. Let its velocity change fr om u to v.\nLet a be the acceleration produced.\nWe studied thr ee equations of motion. The\nrelation connecting the initial velocity ( u)\nand final velocity ( v) of an object moving\nwith a uniform acceleration a, and the\ndisplacement, s is\nv2 – u2 = 2a s\nThis gives\n2 2v – us =\n2a(10.2)\nFrom section 9.4, we know F = m a. Thus,\nusing (Eq. 10.2) in Eq.

This is because work is\ndone on it against gravity while it is being\nraised. The energy present in such an object\nis the gravitational potential energy.\nThe gravitational potential ener gy of an\nobject at a point above the gr ound is defined\nas the work done in raising it fr om the gr ound\nto that point against gravity.\nIt is easy to arrive at an expr ession for\nthe gravitational potential ener gy of an object\nat a height.\nFig. 10.7\nConsider an object of mass, m. Let it be\nraised thr ough a height, h fr\nom the gr ound.\nA force is r equir ed to do this. The minimum\nforce requir ed to raise the object is equal to\nthe weight of the object, mg. The object gains\nenergy equal to the work done on it.  Let the\nwork done on the object against gravity be\nW. That is,\nwork done, W=force ×  displacement\n= mg × h\n= mgh\nSince work done on the object is equal to\nmgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained\nby the object. This is the potential energy ( EP)\nof the object.\nEp = mgh (10.6)\nMore to knowThe potential energy of an object at\na height depends on the ground level\nor the zero level you choose.  An\nobject in a given position can have a\ncertain potential energy with respect\nto one level and a different value of\npotential energy with respect to\nanother level.\nIt is useful to note that the work done by\ngravity depends on the difference in vertical\nheights of the initial and final positions of\nthe object and not on the path along which\nthe object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case\nwhere a block is raised fr om position A to B\nby taking two dif ferent paths. Let the height\nAB = h. In both the situations the work done\non the object is mgh.\nFig. 10.8\nExample 10.5  Find the energy possessed\nby an object of mass 10 kg when it is at\na height of 6 m above the gr ound. Given,\ng = 9.8 m s–2.\nSolution:\nMass of the object, m = 10 kg,\ndisplacement (height), h = 6 m, and\nacceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m s–2.\nFrom Eq. (10.6),\nPotential ener\ngy = mgh\n=10 kg × 9.8 m s–2 × 6 m\n=588 J.\nThe potential ener gy  is 588 J.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWORK AND  ENERGY 121Example 10.6  An object of mass 12 kg is\nat a certain height above the gr ound.\nIf the  potential ener gy of the object is\n480 J, find the height at which the\nobject is with r espect to the gr ound.\nGiven,  g\n = 10 m s–2.\nSolution:\nMass of the object, m  = 12 kg,\npotential energy, Ep = 480 J.\n     Ep=mgh\n480 J =12 kg ×  10 m s–2 × h\n      h = –2480 J\n120 kg ms = 4 m.\nThe object is at the height of 4 m.\n10.2.5 ARE VARIOUS\n ENERGY FORMS\nINTERCONVERTIBLE ?\nCan we convert ener gy fr om one for m to\nanother? W e find in natur e a number of\ninstances of conversion of ener gy from one\nform to another .\nActivity ___________ 10.13\n•Sit in small groups.\n•Discuss the various ways of ener gy\nconversion in natur e.\n•Discuss following questions in your\ngroup:\n(a)How do gr een plants pr oduce food?\n(b)Wher e do they get their ener gy from?\n(c)Why does the air move fr om place\nto place?\n(d)How ar e fuels, such as coal and\npetroleum for med?\n(e)What kinds of energy conversions\nsustain the water cycle?\nActivity ___________ 10.14\n•Many of the human activities and the\ngadgets we use involve conversion of\nenergy from one for m to another .\n•Make a list of such activities and\ngadgets.\n•Identify in each activity/gadget the\nkind of energy conversion that takes\nplace.10.2.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION  OF ENERGY\nIn activities 10.13 and 10.14, we learnt that\nthe form of energy can be changed from one\nform to another . What happens to the total\nenergy of a system during or after the process?\nWhenever energy gets transformed, the total\nenergy remains unchanged. This is the law of\nconservation of energy. According to this law,\nenergy can only be converted from one form\nto another; it can neither be created or\ndestroyed. The total energy before and after\nthe transformation remains the same. The law\nof conservation of energy is valid                  in\nall situations and for all kinds of\ntransformations.\nConsider a simple example. Let an object\nof mass, m be made to fall freely from a     height,\nh. At the start, the potential energy is  mgh and\nkinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic\nenergy zero? It is zero because its velocity is\nzero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh.\nAs it falls, its potential energy will change into\nkinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object\nat a given instant, the kinetic energy would be\n½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the\npotential energy would decrease while the\nkinetic energy would increase. When the object\nis about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v  will\nbe the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy\nwould be the largest and potential energy the\nleast.  However , the sum of the potential ener gy\nand kinetic energy of the object would be the\nsame at all points. That is,\npotential energy + kinetic energy = constant\n   or\n1constant.\n22mgh + mv = (10.7)\nThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy\nof an object is its total mechanical energy.\nWe find that during the fr ee fall of the object,\nthe decrease in potential energy, at any point\nin its path, appears as an equal amount of\nincrease in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of\nair resistance on the motion of the object has\nbeen ignored.) There is thus a continual\ntransformation of gravitational potential\nenergy into kinetic energy.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 122A stronger person may do certain work in\nrelatively less time. A more powerful vehicle\nwould complete a journey in a shorter time\nthan a less power ful one. W e talk of the power\nof machines like motorbikes and motor cars.\nThe speed with which these vehicles change\nenergy or do work is a basis for their\nclassification.  Power measur es the speed of\nwork done, that is, how fast or slow work is\ndone. Power is defined as the rate of doing\nwork or the rate of transfer of ener gy. If an\nagent does a work W  in time t, then power is\ngiven by:\nPower = work/time\norWP =\nt(10.8)\nThe unit of power is watt [in honour of\nJames W att (1736 – 1819)] having the symbol\nW. 1 watt is the power of an agent, which\ndoes work at the rate of 1 joule per second.\nWe can also say that power is 1 W when the\nrate of consumption of ener gy is    1 J s–1.\n1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s–1.\nWe expr ess lar ger rates of ener gy transfer in\nkilowatts (kW).\n1 kilowatt =1000 watts\n1 kW =1000 W\n1 kW =1000 J s–1.\nThe power of an agent may vary with time.\nThis means that the agent may be doing work\nat dif ferent rates at dif ferent intervals of time.\nTherefore the concept of average power is\nuseful. W e obtain average power by dividing\nthe total energy consumed by the total time\ntaken.\nExample 10.7  Two girls, each of weight 400\nN climb up a rope through a height of 8\nm.

Do you agree with this?\n10.3Rate of Doing Work\nDo all of us work at the same rate? Do\nmachines consume or transfer ener gy at the\nsame rate? Agents that transfer ener gy do\nwork at dif ferent rates.

A particle of\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\nobject is first displaced fr om its equilibrium\nposition. It then exerts a for ce on the adjacent\nparticle. As a r esult of which the adjacent\nparticle gets displaced fr om its position of\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\nfirst particle comes back to its original\nposition. This pr ocess continues in the\nmedium till the sound r eaches your ear . The\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\nthe medium travels through the medium and\nnot the particles of the medium.\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\nmotion. They in tur n produce similar motion\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\nmove forwar d themselves, but the\ndisturbance is carried forwar d. This is what\nhappens during pr opagation of sound in a\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\nmotion of particles in the medium and ar e\ncalled mechanical waves.\nAir is the most common medium thr ough\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\nair in front of it creating a region of high\npressur e. This r egion is called a compr ession\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwar ds,\nit creates a r egion of low pr essur e called\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\nof compressions and rarefactions is created in\nthe air .

W e can\nalso pr oduce sound by plucking, scratching,\nrubbing, blowing or shaking dif ferent objects.\nAs per the above activities what do we do to\nthe objects? W e set the objects vibrating and\nproduce sound. V ibration means a kind of\nrapid to and fr o motion of an object. The\nsound of the human voice is pr oduced due\nto vibrations in the vocal cor ds. When a bir d\nflaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think\nhow the buzzing sound accompanying a bee\nis produced. A str etched rubber band when\nplucked vibrates and produces sound. If you\nhave never done this, then do it and observe\nthe vibration of the str etched rubber band.\nActivity _____________ 11.3\n•Make a list of different types of\nmusical instruments and discuss\nwith your friends which part of the\ninstrument vibrates to produce\nsound.\n11.2Propagation of Sound\nSound is pr oduced by vibrating objects. The\nmatter or substance thr ough which sound\nis transmitted is called a medium. It can be\nsolid, liquid or gas. Sound moves thr ough a\nmedium from the point of generation to the\nlistener . When an object vibrates, it sets the\nparticles of the medium ar ound it vibrating.\nThe particles do not travel all the way fromFig. 11.4: A vibrating object creating a series of\ncompr essions (C) and rar efactions (R) in\nthe medium.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSOUND 129propagates through the medium.\nCompr ession is the r egion of high pr essur e\nand rar efaction is the r egion of low pr essur e.\nPressur e is related to the number of particles\nof a medium in a given volume. Mor e density\nof the particles in the medium gives mor e\npressur e and vice versa. Thus, pr opagation\nof sound can be visualised as pr opagation of\ndensity variations or pr essur e variations in\nthe medium.\nuestion\n1.How does the sound produced by\na vibrating object in a medium\nreach your ear?\n2.Explain how sound is produced\nby your school bell.\n3.Why are sound waves called\nmechanical waves?\n4.Suppose you and your friend are\non the moon. W ill you be able to\nhear any sound pr oduced by\nyour friend?\n11.2.1 SOUND  WAVES  ARE LONGITUDINAL\nWAVES\nActivity _____________ 11.4\n•Take a slinky.  Ask your friend to hold\none end. Y ou hold the other end.\nNow str etch the slinky as shown in\nFig. 11.5(a). Then give it a sharp push\ntowards your friend.\n•What do you notice? If you move your\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\nalternatively, what will you observe?\n•If you mark a dot on the slinky, you\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\nwill move back and forth parallel to\nthe direction of the propagation of the\ndisturbance.The regions where the coils become closer\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\npropagates in the medium as a series of\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\nThe particles do not move from one place to\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\nforth about their position of rest. This is\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\nThere is also another type of wave, called\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\nthe individual particles of the medium move\nabout their mean positions in a direction\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\nare not of the medium particles or their\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\nwave. Y ou will come to know mor e about\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS  OF A SOUND\nWAVE\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\n•frequency\n•amplitude and\n•speed.Q\nA sound wave in graphic form is shown in\nFig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and\npressure change when the sound wave moves\nin the medium. The density as well as the\npressure of the medium at a given time varies\nwith distance, above and below the average\nvalue of density and pressure. Fig. 11.6(a) and(b)(a)\nFig. 11.5:  Longitudinal wave in a slinky.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 130Heinrich Rudolph Hertz\nwas born on 22 February\n1857 in Hamburg,\nGermany and educated at\nthe University of Berlin. He\nconfirmed J.C. Maxwell’s\nelectromagnetic theory by\nhis experiments. He laid the\nfoundation for future\ndevelopment of radio, telephone, telegraph\nand even television. He also discovered the\nphotoelectric effect which was later\nexplained by Albert Einstein. The SI unit of\nfrequency was named as hertz in his honour .Fig. 11.6(b) represent the density and\npressure variations, respectively, as a sound\nwave propagates in the medium.\nCompressions are the regions where\nparticles are crowded together and\nrepresented by the upper portion of the curve\nin Fig. 11.6(c). The peak represents the region\nof maximum compression. Thus,\ncompressions are regions where density as\nwell as pressure is high. Rarefactions are the\nregions of low pressure where particles are\nspread apart and are represented by the\nvalley, that is, the lower portion of the curve\nin Fig. 11.6(c). A peak is called the crest and a\nvalley is called the trough of a wave.\nThe distance between two consecutive\ncompressions (C) or two consecutive\nrarefactions (R) is called the wavelength, as\nshown in Fig. 11.6(c), The wavelength is\nusually represented by λ (Greek letter\nlambda). Its SI unit is metre (m).\nH. R. Hertz\nFig. 11.6: Sound propagates as density or pressure variations as shown in (a) and (b), (c) represents\ngraphically the density and pr essur e variations.Frequency tells us how frequently an\nevent occurs. Suppose you are beating a\ndrum. How many times you are beating the\ndrum in unit time is called the frequency of\nyour beating the drum. W e know that when\nsound is propagated through a medium, the\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSOUND 131 131131131131How the brain interprets the frequency\nof an emitted sound is called its pitch. The\nfaster the vibration of the source, the\nhigher is the frequency and the higher is\nthe pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a\nhigh pitch sound corresponds to more\nnumber of compressions and rarefactions\npassing a fixed point per unit time.\nObjects of different sizes and conditions\nvibrate at different frequencies to produce\nsounds of different pitch.\nThe magnitude of the maximum\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,as shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit\nwill be that of density or pressure.\nThe loudness or softness of a sound is\ndetermined basically by its amplitude. The\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\nthe force with which an object is made to\nvibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wavedensity of the medium oscillates between a\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\nchange in density from the maximum value\nto the minimum value, then again to the\nmaximum value, makes one complete\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\nwave. If we can count the number of the\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\nn (Greek letter , nu). I ts SI unit is hertz\n(symbol, Hz).\nThe time taken by two consecutive\ncompressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed\npoint is called the time period of the wave. In\nother words, we can say that the time taken\nfor one complete oscillation is called the time\nperiod of the sound wave. It is represented by\nthe symbol T. Its SI unit is second (s).\nFrequency and time period are related as\nfollows:\n     A violin and a flute may both be played\nat the same time in an orchestra. Both sounds\ntravel through the same medium, that is, air\nand arrive at our ear at the same time. Both\nsounds travel at the same speed irrespective\nof the source. But the sounds we receive are\ndifferent. This is due to the dif ferent\ncharacteristics associated with the sound.\nPitch is one of the characteristics.=1vTFig. 11.7: Fig. 11.7:Fig. 11.7: Fig. 11.7:Fig. 11.7: Low pitch sound has low frequency and\nhigh pitch of sound has high frequency.\nFig. 11.8:Fig. 11.8:Fig. 11.8:Fig. 11.8:Fig. 11.8: Soft sound has small amplitude and\nlouder sound has large amplitude.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 132QQuestions\n1.Which wave property determines\n(a) loudness, (b) pitch?\n2.Guess which sound has a higher\npitch: guitar or car horn?\nThe speed of sound is defined as the\ndistance which a point on a wave, such as a\ncompression or a rarefaction, travels per unit\ntime.\nWe know,\nspeed, v = distance / time\n= λ\nTExample 11.1 A sound wave has a\nfrequency of 2 kHz and wave length\n35 cm.

What is the time interval\nbetween successive compr essions\nfrom the source?\nThe amount of sound energy passing each\nsecond through unit area is called the intensity\nof sound. W e sometimes use the ter ms\n“loudness” and “intensity” interchangeably,\nbut they are not the same. Loudness is a\nmeasure of the response of the ear to the sound.\nEven when two sounds are of equal intensity,\nwe may hear one as louder than the other\nsimply because our ear detects it better .of less energy (amplitude). If we hit the table\nhard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell\nwhy? A sound wave spreads out from its\nsource. As it moves away from the source its\namplitude as well as its loudness decreases.\nLouder sound can travel a larger distance as\nit is associated with higher energy. Fig. 11.8\nshows the wave shapes of a loud and a soft\nsound of the same frequency.\nThe quality or timber of sound is that\ncharacteristic which enables us to distinguish\none sound from another having the same pitch\nand loudness. The sound which is more\npleasant is said to be of a rich quality. A sound\nof single frequency is called a tone. The sound\nwhich is produced due to a mixture of several\nfrequencies is called a note and is pleasant to\nlisten to. Noise is unpleasant to the ear! Music\nis pleasant to hear and is of rich quality.\nHere λ is the wavelength of the sound wave. It\nis the distance travelled by the sound wave in\none time period ( T) of the wave. Thus,\nv = λ ν \nor v = λ ν\nThat is, speed = wavelength × frequency.\nThe speed of sound remains almost the\nsame for all frequencies in a given medium\nunder the same physical conditions.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSOUND 133uestion\n1.Distinguish between loudness\nand intensity of sound.uestion\n1.In which of the thr ee media, air ,\nwater or iron, does sound travel\nthe fastest at a particular\ntemperature?\n11.3 Reflection of Sound\nSound bounces off a solid or a liquid like a\nrubber ball bounces off a wall. Like light, sound\ngets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid\nand follows the same laws of reflection as you\nhave studied in earlier classes. The directions\nin which the sound is incident and is reflected\nmake equal angles with the normal to the\nreflecting surface at the point of incidence, and\nthe three are in the same plane. An obstacle of\nlarge size which may be polished or rough is\nneeded for the reflection of sound waves.\nActivity _____________ 11.5\n•Take two identical pipes, as shown in\nFig. 11.9. Y ou can make the pipes\nusing chart paper .

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\nthe medium thr ough which it travels. Y ou will\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\nm s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC. The speeds\nof sound at a particular temperature in various\nmedia ar e listed in T able 11.1. Y ou need not\nmemorise the values.\nTable 11.1: Speed of sound in\ndifferent media at 25 ºC\nState Substance Speed in m/s\nSolids Aluminium 6420\nNickel 6040\nSteel 5960\nIron 5950\nBrass 4700\nGlass (Flint) 3980\nLiquids Water (Sea) 1531\nWater (distilled) 1498\nEthanol 1207\nMethanol 1103\nGases Hydrogen 1284\nHelium 965\nAir 346\nOxygen 316\nSulphur dioxide 213Fig. 11.9:  Reflection of sound\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 13411.3.1 ECHO\nIf we shout or clap near a suitable reflecting\nobject such as a tall building or a\nmountain,we will hear the same sound\nagain a little  later . This sound which we\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\nbetween the original sound and the\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\ngiven temperatur e, say at 22 ºC in air , the\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\nthe sound from the point of generation to\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\nsound must be half of this distance, that\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\nthe temperatur e of air . Echoes may be hear d\nmore than once due to successive or\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\nis due to the successive reflections of the\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\naudible. The repeated reflection that\nresults in this persistence of sound is\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\nExample 11.2  A person clapped his hands\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.What is the distance of the cliff from the\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\nSolution:\nGiven,\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\nt = 2 s\nDistance travelled by the sound\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\ndistance between the cliff and the\nperson. Hence, the distance between the\ncliff and the person\n= 692 m/2 = 346 m.\nQ\nHorn\nMegaphone\nFig 11.10:   A megaphone and a horn.uestion\n1.An echo is heard in 3 s.

In stethoscopes the sound of the\npatient’s heartbeat reaches the doctor’s\nears by multiple reflection of sound, as\nshown in Fig.11.11.\nFig. 11.12:  Curved ceiling of a conference hall.Fig. 11.13:  Sound board used in a big hall.\nuestion\n1.Why are the ceilings of concert\nhalls curved?\n11.4Range of Hearing\nThe audible range of sound for human beings\nextends from about 20 Hz to 20000 Hz (one\nHz = one cycle/s). Children under the age of\nfive and some animals, such as dogs can hear\nup to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people\ngrow older their ears become less sensitive to\nhigher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies\nbelow 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or\ninfrasound. If we could hear infrasound we\nwould hear the vibrations of a pendulum just\nas we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee.\nRhinoceroses communicate using infrasound\nof frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and\nelephants produce sound in the infrasound\nrange. It is observed that some animals get\ndisturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes\nproduce low-frequency infrasound before the\nmain shock waves begin which possibly alert\nthe animals. Frequencies higher than 20 kHz\nare called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound.\nUltrasound is produced by animals such as\ndolphins, bats and porpoises. Moths of certain\nfamilies have very sensitive hearing equipment.\nThese moths can hear the high frequencyQ\nFig.11.11:  Stethoscope\n3.Generally the ceilings of concert halls,\nconference halls and cinema halls are\ncurved so that sound after reflection\nreaches all corners of the hall, as\nshown in Fig 1 1.12. Sometimes a\ncurved soundboard may be placed\nbehind the stage so that the sound,\nafter reflecting from the sound board,\nspreads evenly across the width of the\nhall (Fig 1 1.13).In these instruments, a tube followed\nby a conical opening reflects sound\nsuccessively to guide most of the\nsound waves from the source in the\nforward direction towards the\naudience.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 136squeaks of the bat and know when a bat\nis flying nearby, and are able to escape\ncapture.

{"class": "9", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 12: improvement in food resources", "content": "SCIENCE 140We know that all living or ganisms need food.\nFood supplies pr oteins, carbohydrates, fats,\nvitamins and minerals, all of which we r equir e\nfor body development, gr owth and health.\nBoth plants and animals ar e major sources\nof food for us. W e obtain most of this food\nfrom agricultur e and animal husbandry.\nWe read in newspapers that ef forts ar e\nalways being made to impr ove pr oduction\nfrom agricultur e and animal husbandry. Why\nis this necessary? Why we cannot make do\nwith the curr ent levels of pr oduction?\nIndia is a very populous country. Our\npopulation is mor e than one billion people,\nand it is still gr owing. As food for this gr owing\npopulation, we will soon need mor e than a\nquarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year .\nThis can be done by far ming on more land.\nBut India is alr eady intensively cultivated. As\na result, we do not have any major scope for\nincreasing the ar ea of land under cultivation.\nTherefore, it is necessary to incr ease our\nproduction ef ficiency for both cr ops and\nlivestock.\nEfforts to meet the food demand by\nincr\neasing food pr oduction have led to some\nsuccesses so far . We have had the gr een\nrevolution, which contributed to incr eased\nfood-grain pr oduction. W e have also had the\nwhite revolution, which has led to better and\nmore efficient use as well as availability of milk.\nHowever , these r evolutions mean that our\nnatural resources are getting used more\nintensively. As a result, there are more\nchances of causing damage to our natural\nresources to the point of destroying their\nbalance completely. Therefore, it is important\nthat we should increase food production\nwithout degrading our environment anddisturbing the balances maintaining it. Hence,\nthere is a need for sustainable practices in\nagriculture and animal husbandry.\nAlso, simply increasing grain production\nfor storage in warehouses cannot solve the\nproblem of malnutrition and hunger . People\nshould have money to purchase food. Food\nsecurity depends on both availability of food\nand access to it. The majority of our\npopulation depends on agriculture for their\nlivelihood. Increasing the incomes of people\nworking in agriculture is therefore necessary\nto combat the pr oblem of hunger . Scientific\nmanagement practices should be undertaken\nto obtain high yields from farms. For\nsustained livelihood, one should undertake\nmixed farming, intercropping, and integrated\nfarming practices, for example, combine\nagriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/\nbee-keeping.\nThe question thus becomes – how do we\nincrease the yields of crops and livestock?\n12.1Improvement in Crop Yields\nCereals such as wheat, rice, maize, millets and\nsorghum provide us carbohydrate for energy\nrequirement. Pulses like gram ( chana ), pea\n(matar ), black gram ( urad), green gram ( moong ),\npigeon pea ( arhar ), lentil ( masoor ), provide us with\nprotein. And oil seeds including soyabean,\nground nut, sesame, castor , mustar d, linseed and\nsunflower provide us with necessary fats (Fig.\n12.1). V egetables, spices and fruits pr ovide a\nrange of vitamins and minerals in addition to\nsmall amounts of proteins, carbohydrates and\nfats. In addition to these food crops, fodder crops\nlike berseem , oats or sudan grass  are raised as\nfood for the livestock.12\nI II IIMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENT      IN ININ ININ F  F F  F FOOD OODOOD OODOOD R  R R  R RESOURCESESOURCESESOURCESESOURCESESOURCESChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 141the kharif  season from the month of June to\nOctober , and some of the cr ops ar e grown in\nthe winter season, called the rabi season from\nNovember to April. Paddy, soyabean, pigeon\npea, maize, cotton, gr een gram and black\ngram are kharif  crops, wher\neas wheat, gram,\npeas, mustar d, linseed are rabi crops.\nIn India ther e has been a four times\nincrease in the production of food grains from\n1952 to 2010 with only 25% increase in the\ncultivable land area. How has this incr ease\nin pr oduction been achieved? If we think of\nthe practices involved in far ming, we can see\nthat we can divide it into thr ee stages. The\nfirst is the choice of seeds for planting. The\nsecond is the nurturing of the cr op plants.\nThe third is the pr otection of the growing and\nharvested cr ops from loss. Thus, the major\ngroups of activities for impr oving cr op yields\ncan be classified as:\n•Crop variety improvement\n•Crop pr oduction impr ovement\n•Crop protection management.\n12.1.1 CROP VARIETY  IMPROVEMENT\nThis approach depends on finding a crop\nvariety that can give a good yield. V arieties or\nstrains of cr ops can be selected by breeding\nfor various useful characteristics such as\ndisease r esistance, r esponse to fertilisers,\nproduct quality and high yields. One way of\nincorporating desirable characters into cr op\nvarieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation\nrefers to cr ossing between genetically\ndissimilar plants. This cr ossing may be\nintervarietal (between dif ferent varieties),\ninterspecific (between two dif ferent species of\nthe same genus) or inter generic (between\ndifferent genera). Another way of impr oving\nthe crop is by intr oducing a gene that would\nprovide the desir ed characteristic. This\nresults in genetically modified cr ops.\nFor new varieties of crops to be accepted,\nit is necessary that the variety pr oduces high\nyields under dif ferent conditions that ar e\nfound in dif ferent ar eas. Far mers would need\nto be provided with good quality seeds of a\nparticular variety, that is, the seeds should allFig. 12.1:  Different types of crops\nuestion\n1.What do we get fr om cer eals,\npulses, fruits and vegetables?\nDifferent crops r equir e different climatic\nconditions, temperatur e and photoperiods for\ntheir gr owth and completion of their life cycle.\nPhotoperiods ar e related to the duration of\nsunlight. Gr owth of plants and flowering ar e\ndependent on sunlight. As we all know, plants\nmanufactur e their food in sunlight by the\nprocess of photosynthesis. There are some\ncrops, which are grown in rainy season, called\nQ\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 142be of the same variety and germinate under\nthe same conditions.\nCultivation practices and crop yield are\nrelated to weather , soil quality and availability\nof water . Since weather conditions such as\ndrought and flood situations ar e\nunpr edictable, varieties that can be gr own in\ndiverse climatic conditions ar e useful.\nSimilarly, varieties tolerant to high soil  salinity\nhave been developed. Some of the factors for\nwhich variety impr ovement is done ar e:\n•Higher yield: T o increase the\nproductivity of the cr op per acr\ne.\n•Impr oved quality: Quality\nconsiderations of cr op pr oducts vary\nfrom cr op to cr op. Baking quality is\nimportant in wheat, pr otein quality in\npulses, oil quality in oilseeds and\npreserving quality in fruits and\nvegetables.\n•Biotic and abiotic r esistance: Cr ops\nproduction can go down due to biotic\n(diseases, insects and nematodes) and\nabiotic (dr ought, salinity, water\nlogging, heat, cold and fr ost) str esses\nunder dif ferent situations. V arieties\nresistant to these str esses can impr ove\ncrop production.\n•Change in maturity duration: The\nshorter the duration of the cr op from\nsowing to harvesting, the mor e\neconomical is the variety. Such short\ndurations allow far mers to gr ow\nmultiple r ounds of cr ops in a year .\nShort duration also r educes the cost\nof crop production. Unifor m maturity\nmakes the harvesting pr ocess easy\nand r educes losses during harvesting.\n•Wider adaptability: Developing\nvarieties for wider adaptability will\nhelp in stabilising the cr op pr oduction\nunder dif ferent envir onmental\nconditions. One variety can then be\ngrown under dif ferent climatic\nconditions in dif ferent ar eas.\n•Desirable agr onomic characteristics:\nTallness and pr ofuse branching ar e\ndesirable characters for fodder cr ops.\nDwarfness is desired in cereals, so thatless nutrients are consumed by these\ncrops. Thus developing varieties of\ndesired agronomic characters help give\nhigher productivity.\nuestions\n1.How do biotic and abiotic factors\naffect cr op pr oduction?\n2.What are the desirable agr onomic\ncharacteristics for crop\nimprovements?\n12.1.2 CROP PRODUCTION  MANAGEMENT\nIn India, as in many other agriculture-based\ncountries, farming ranges from small to very\nlarge farms. Different farmers thus have more\nor less land, money and access to information\nand technologies. In short, it is the money or\nfinancial conditions that allow farmers to take\nup different farming practices and agricultural\ntechnologies. There is a correlation between\nhigher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer’s\npurchasing capacity for inputs decides\ncropping system and production practices.\nTherefore, production practices can be at\ndifferent levels. They include ‘no cost’\nproduction, ‘low cost’ production and ‘high\ncost’ production practices.\n12.1.2 ( i)  NUTRIENT  MANAGEMENT\nJust as we need food for development, growth\nand well-being, plants also require nutrients\nfor growth. Nutrients are supplied to plants\nby air , water and soil. Ther e are several\nnutrients which are essential for plants. Air\nsupplies carbon and oxygen, hydrogen comes\nfrom water , and soil supplies the other thirteen\nnutrients to plants. Amongst these, some are\nrequired in large quantities and are therefore\ncalled macro-nutrients. The other nutrients are\nused by plants in small quantities and are\ntherefore called micro-nutrients (Table 12.1).Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 143 143143143143our environment from excessive use of\nfertilizers. Using biological waste material is\nalso a way of recycling farm waste. Based on\nthe kind of biological material used, manure\ncan be classified as:\n(i)Compost and vermi-compost: The\nprocess in which far m waste material\nlike livestock excreta (cow dung, etc.),\nvegetable waste, animal r efuse,\ndomestic waste, sewage waste, straw,\neradicated weeds etc. is decomposed\nin pits is known as composting. The\ncompost is rich in or ganic matter and\nnutrients. Compost is also pr epar\ned\nby using earthwor ms to hasten the\nprocess of decomposition of plant and\nanimal refuse. This is called\nvermi-compost.\n(ii)Green manure: Prior to the sowing of\nthe cr op seeds, some plants like sun\nhemp or guar ar e grown and then\nmulched by ploughing them into the\nsoil. These gr een plants thus tur n into\ngreen manure which helps in\nenriching the soil in nitrogen\nand phosphorus.\nFERTILIZERS\nFertilizers are commercially produced plant\nnutrients. Fertilizers supply nitr ogen,\nphosphorus and potassium. They ar e used\nto ensur e good vegetative gr owth (leaves,\nbranches and flowers), giving rise to healthy\nplants. Fertilizers are a factor in the higher\nyields of high-cost far ming.\nFertilizers should be applied car efully in\nterms of pr oper dose, time, and observing pr e-\nand post-application pr ecautions for their\ncomplete utilisation. For example, sometimes\nfertilizers get washed away due to excessive\nirrigation and ar e not fully absorbed by the\nplants. This excess fertilizer then leads to\nwater pollution.\nAlso, as we have seen in the previous class,\ncontinuous use of fertilizers in an area can\ndestroy soil fertility because the organic\nmatter in the soil is not replenished and\nmicro-organisms in the soil are harmed by the\nfertilizers used. Short-term benefits of using\nfertilizers and long-term benefits of usingDeficiency of these nutrients affects\nphysiological processes in plants including\nreproduction, growth and susceptibility to\ndiseases. To increase the yield, the soil can be\nenriched by supplying these nutrients in the\nform of manure and fertilizers.\nuestions\n1.What ar e macr o-nutrients and\nwhy ar e they called macr o-\nnutrients?\n2.How do plants get nutrients?\nMANURE\nManure contains lar ge quantities of or ganic\nmatter and also supplies small quantities of\nnutrients to the soil. Manur e is pr epared by\nthe decomposition of animal excr eta and plant\nwaste. Manure helps in enriching soil with\nnutrients and or ganic matter and increasing\nsoil fertility. The bulk of or ganic matter in\nmanur e helps in impr oving the soil structur e.\nThis involves incr easing the water holding\ncapacity in sandy soils. In clayey soils, the\nlarge quantities of organic matter help in\ndrainage and in avoiding water logging.\nIn using manure we use biological waste\nmaterial, which is advantageous in protectingTable 12.1: Nutrients suppliedTable 12.1: Nutrients suppliedTable 12.1: Nutrients suppliedTable 12.1: Nutrients suppliedTable 12.1: Nutrients supplied\nby air, water and soilby air, water and soilby air, water and soilby air, water and soilby air, water and soil\nAir carbon, oxygen\nWater hydrogen, oxygen\nSoil (i)Macronutrients :\nnitrogen, phosphorus,\npotassium, calcium,\nmagnesium, sulphur\n(ii)Micronutrients:\niron, manganese, boron,\nzinc, copper ,\nmolybdenum, chlorine\nQSource SourceSource SourceSource NutrientsNutrientsNutrientsNutrientsNutrients\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 144India has a wide variety of water resources\nand a highly varied climate. Under such\nconditions, several different kinds of irrigation\nsystems are adopted to supply water to\nagricultural lands depending on the kinds of\nwater resources available. These include wells,\ncanals, rivers and tanks.\n•Wells:  There are two types of wells,\nnamely dug wells and tube wells. In a\ndug well, water is collected fr om water\nbearing strata. Tube wells can tap\nwater fr om the deeper strata. Fr om\nthese wells, water is lifted by pumps\nfor irrigation.\n•Canals:  This is usually an elaborate\nand extensive irrigation system. In this\nsystem canals r eceive water fr\nom one\nor mor e reservoirs or fr om rivers. The\nmain canal is divided into branch\ncanals having further distributaries to\nirrigate fields.\n•River Lift Systems : In ar eas where\ncanal flow is insuf ficient or irregular\ndue to inadequate r eservoir r elease,\nthe lift system is mor e rational. W ater\nis dir ectly drawn fr om the rivers for\nsupplementing irrigation in ar eas\nclose to rivers.\n•Tanks:  These ar e small storage\nreservoirs, which inter cept and stor e\nthe run-of f of smaller catchment\nareas.\nFresh initiatives for incr easing the water\navailable for agricultur e include rainwater\nharvesting and watershed management. This\ninvolves building small check-dams which\nlead to an incr ease in gr ound water levels.\nThe check-dams stop the rainwater fr om\nflowing away and also reduce soil erosion.\n12.1.2 ( iii)  CROPPING  PATTERNS\nDifferent ways of gr owing cr ops can be used\nto give maximum benefit.\nMixed cr opping is gr owing two or mor e\ncrops simultaneously on the same piece of\nland, for example, wheat + gram, or wheat +\nmustar d, or gr oundnut + sunflower . This\nreduces risk and gives some insurance\nagainst failur e of one of the cr ops.manure for maintaining soil fertility have to\nbe considered while aiming for optimum yields\nin crop production.\nuestion\n1.Compare the use of manure and\nfertilizers in maintaining soil\nfertility.\nOrganic far ming is a far ming system with\nminimal or no use of chemicals as fertilizers,\nherbicides, pesticides, etc., and with a\nmaximum input of or ganic manur es, recycled\nfarm-wastes (straw and livestock excr eta), use\nof bio-agents such as cultur e of blue green\nalgae in pr eparation of biofertilizers, neem\nleaves or tur meric specifically in grain storage\nas bio-pesticides, with healthy cr opping\nsystems [mixed cr opping, inter -cropping and\ncrop rotation as discussed below in 12.1.2.(iii)].\nThese cropping systems are beneficial in\ninsect, pest and wheat control besides\nproviding nutrients.\n12.1.2 ( ii)  IRRIGATION\nMost agriculture in India is rain-fed, that is,\nthe success of cr ops in most ar eas is\ndependent on timely monsoons and suf ficient\nrainfall spread thr ough most of the growing\nseason. Hence, poor monsoons cause cr op\nfailur e. Ensuring that the cr ops get water at\nthe right stages during their gr owing season\ncan incr ease the expected yields of any cr op.\nTherefor e, many measur es are used to bring\nmore and more agricultural land\nunder irrigation.Q\nMore to  knowDroughts occur because of scarcity or\nirregular distribution of rains. Drought\nposes a threat to rain-fed farming\nareas, where farmers do not use\nirrigation for crop production and\ndepend only on rain. Light soils have\nless water retention capacity. In areas\nwith light soils, crops get adversely\naffected by drought conditions.\nScientists have developed some crop\nvarieties which can tolerate drought\nconditions.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 145 145145145145Inter-cropping is growing two or more\ncrops simultaneously on the same field in a\ndefinite pattern (Fig.12.2). A few rows of one\ncrop alternate with a few rows of a second\ncrop, for example, soyabean + maize, or finger\nmillet ( bajra ) + cowpea ( lobia). The crops are\nselected such that their nutrient\nrequirements are dif ferent. This ensures\nmaximum utilisation of the nutrients\nsupplied, and also prevents pests and\ndiseases from spreading to all the plants\nbelonging to one crop in a field. This way ,\nboth crops can give better returns.(gokhroo ), Parthenium  (gajar ghas ), Cyperus\nrotundus  (motha ). They compete for food,\nspace and light. W eeds take up nutrients and\nreduce the growth of the crop. Therefore,\nremoval of weeds from cultivated fields during\nthe early stages of crop growth is essential for\na good harvest.\nGenerally insect pests attack the plants\nin thre e ways: (i) they cut the ro ot, stem and\nleaf, (ii) they suck the cell sap from various\nparts of the plant, and (iii) they bore into stem\nand fruits. They thus af fect the health of the\ncrop and reduce yields.\nDiseases in plants are caused by\npathogens such as bacteria, fungi and  viruses.\nThese pathogens can be present in and\ntransmitted through the soil, water and air .\nWeeds, insects and diseases can be\ncontrolled by various methods. O ne of the\nmost commonly used methods is the use of\npesticides, which include herbicides,\ninsecticides and fungicides. These chemicals\nare sprayed on crop plants or used for treating\nseeds and soil. H owever , excessive use of\nthese chemicals creates problems, since they\ncan be poisonous to many plant and animal\nspecies and cause environmental pollution.\nWeed control methods also include\nmechanical removal. Preventive methods\nsuch as proper se ed bed preparation, timely\nsowing of crops, intercropping and crop\nrotation also help in we ed control. Some other\npreventive measures against pests are the use\nof resistant varieties, and summer ploughing,\nin which fields are ploughed de ep in summers\nto destroy we eds and pests.\nuestion\n1.Which of the following conditions\nwill give the most benefits? Why?\n(a)Farmers use high-quality\nseeds, do not adopt\nirrigation or use fertilizers.\n(b)Farmers use ordinary\nseeds, adopt irrigation and\nuse fertilizer .\n(c)Farmers use quality se eds,\nadopt irrigation, use\nfertilizer and use crop\nprotection measures.Q\nFig. 12.2 :Fig. 12.2 :Fig. 12.2 :Fig. 12.2 :Fig. 12.2 :  Intercropping\nThe growing of different crops on a piece\nof land in a pre-planned succession is known\nas crop rotation. Depending upon the\nduration, crop rotation is done for dif ferent\ncrop combinations. The availability of moisture\nand irrigation facilities decide the choice of the\ncrop to be cultivated after one harvest. If crop\nrotation is done properly then two or three\ncrops can be grown in a year with\ngood harvests.\n12.1.3 CROP PROTECTION MANAGEMENT\nField crops are infested by a large number of\nweeds, insect pests and diseases. If weeds and\npests are not controlled at the appropriate\ntime then they can damage the crops so much\nthat most of the crop is lost.\nWeeds are unwanted plants in the\ncultivated field, for example, Xanthium\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 146Activity _____________ 12.1\n•Visit a nearby garden/agricultural\nfield and make a list of the weeds and\nthe flowers/crops found in the area.\nAlso, make a list of insect pests, if\nany, infesting the flowers/crops.\nSTORAGE  OF GRAINS\nStorage losses in agricultural produce can be\nvery high. Factors responsible for such losses\nare biotic— insects, rodents, fungi, mites and\nbacteria, and abiotic— inappropriate moisture\nand temperatures in the place of storage. These\nfactors cause degradation in quality, loss in\nweight, poor germinability, discolouration of\nproduce, all leading to poor marketability.\nThese factors can be controlled by proper\ntreatment and by systematic management of\nwarehouses.\nPreventive and control measures are used\nbefore grains are stored for future use. They\ninclude strict cleaning of the produce before\nstorage, proper drying of the produce first in\nsunlight and then in shade, and fumigation\nusing chemicals that can kill pests.\nuestions\n1.Why should preventive measures\nand biological control methods be\npreferred for protecting crops?\n2.What factors may be responsible\nfor losses of grains during\nstorage?Activity _____________ 12.2\n•Collect grains/seeds of cereals,\npulses and oil seeds and gather\ninformation about the seasons in\nwhich they are sown and harvested.\n12.2Animal Husbandry\nAnimal husbandry is the scientific\nmanagement of animal livestock. It includes\nvarious aspects such as feeding, br eeding and\ndisease contr ol. Animal-based far ming\nincludes cattle, goat, sheep, poultry and fish\nfarming. As the population incr eases and as\nliving standar ds incr ease, the demand for\nmilk, eggs and meat is also going up. Also,\nthe gr owing awar eness of the need for\nhumane tr eatment of livestock has br ought\nin new limitations in livestock farming. Thus,\nlivestock production also needs to be improved.\n12.2.1 CATTLE FARMING\nCattle husbandry is done for two purposes—\nmilk and draught labour for agricultural work\nsuch as tilling, irrigation and carting. Indian\ncattle belong to two dif ferent species, Bos\nindicus , cows, and Bos bubalis , buf faloes.\nMilk-pr oducing females ar e called milch\nanimals (dairy animals), while the ones used\nfor far m labour are called draught animals.\nMilk production depends, to some extent,\non the duration of the lactation period,\nmeaning the period of milk production after QTable 12.2: Nutritional values of animal products\nAnimal\nProducts\nFat Protein Sugar Minerals Water Vitamins\nMilk (Cow) 3.60 4.00 4.50\n0.70 87.20 B1, B2, B12, D, E\nEgg 12.00 13.00 * 1.00 74.00 B2, D\nMeat 3.60 21.10 * 1.10 74.20 B2, B12\nFish 2.50 19.00 * 1.30 77.20 Niacin, D, A\n*Present in very small amountsPer cent (%) Nutrients\nReprint 2025-26\n\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 147the birth of a calf.

Animals\nrequire regular brushing to remove dirt andloose hair . They should be sheltered under\nwell-ventilated roofed sheds that protect them\nfrom rain, heat and cold. The floor of the cattle\nshed needs to be sloping so as to stay dry\nand to facilitate cleaning.\nThe food r equir ements of dairy animals\nare of two types: (a) maintenance\nrequir ement, which is the food r equir ed to\nsupport the animal to live a healthy life, and\n(b) milk pr oducing r equir ement, which is the\ntype of food r equir ed during the lactation\nperiod. Animal feed includes: (a) r oughage,\nwhich is largely fibr e, and (b) concentrates,\nwhich ar e low in fibre and contain r elatively\nhigh levels of pr oteins and other nutrients.\nCattle need balanced rations containing all\nnutrients in pr oportionate amounts.

Brackish water\nresour\nces, wher e seawater and fr esh water\nmix together , such as estuaries and lagoons\nare also important fish r eservoirs. While\ncaptur e fishing is also done in such inland\nwater bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish\nproduction fr om these resources is thr ough\naquacultur e.\nFish cultur e is sometimes done in\ncombination with a rice cr op, so that fish ar e\ngrown in the water in the paddy field. Mor e\nintensive fish far ming can be done in\ncomposite fish cultur e systems. Both local\nand imported fish species ar e used in such\nsystems.In such a system, a combination of five or\nsix fish species is used in a single fishpond.\nThese species ar e selected so that they do\nnot compete for food among them having\ndifferent types of food habits. As a r esult, the\nfood available in all the parts of the pond is\nused. As Catlas are sur face feeders, Rohus\nfeed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals\nand Common Carps ar e bottom feeders, and\nGrass Carps feed on the weeds, together these\nspecies (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the\npond without competing with each other .

Even if fish seed is collected\nfrom the wild, it can be mixed with that of\nother species as well. So, a major pr oblem in\nfish far ming is the lack of availability of good-\nquality seed.

Since bee-keeping\nneeds low investments, far mers use it as an\nadditional income generating activity. In\naddition to honey, the beehives ar e a source\nof wax which is used in various medicinal\npreparations.\nThe local varieties of bees used for\ncommer cial honey pr oduction ar e Apis cerana\nindica , commonly known as the Indian bee,\nA. dorsata,  the rock bee and A. florae,  the little\nbee. An Italian bee variety, A. mellifera, has\nalso been brought in to increase yield of honey.This is the variety commonly used for\ncommercial honey production.\nThe Italian bees have high honey collection\ncapacity. They sting somewhat less. They stay\nin a given beehive for long periods, and breed\nvery well. For commercial honey production,\nbee farms or apiaries are established.\nThe value or quality of honey depends\nupon the pasturage, or the flowers available\nto the bees for nectar and pollen collection.\nIn addition to adequate quantity of pasturage,\nthe kind of flowers available will deter mine\nthe taste of the honey.\nuestions\n1.What ar e the desirable\ncharacters of bee varieties\nsuitable for honey production?\n2.What is pasturage and how is it\nrelated to honey production?Q\n(a) (b)\nFig. 12.7:  (a) Arrangement of beehive in an apiary\n(b) honey extractor\nQ\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n• There are several nutrients essential for crops.

Everything in this universe is\nmade up of material which scientists have\nnamed “matter”. The air we br\neathe, the food\nwe eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and\nanimals, even a small dr op of water or a\nparticle of sand — every thing is matter . We\ncan also see as we look around that all the\nthings mentioned above occupy space and\nhave mass. In other words, they have both\nmass* and volume**.\nSince early times, human beings have\nbeen trying to understand their surr oundings.\nEarly Indian philosophers  classified matter in\nthe form of five basic elements — the “Panch\nTatva” — air , earth, fir e, sky and water .\nAccording to them everything, living or non-\nliving, was made up of these five basic\nelements. Ancient Gr eek philosophers had\narrived at a similar classification of matter .\nModer n day scientists have evolved two\ntypes of classification of matter based on their\nphysical properties and chemical natur e.\nIn this chapter we shall lear n about\nmatter based on its physical pr operties.\nChemical aspects of matter will be taken up\nin subsequent chapters.\n1.1  Physical Nature of Matter\n1.1.1 M ATTER  IS MADE  UP OF PARTICLES\nFor a long time, two schools of thought prevailed\nregarding the natur e of matter . One school\nbelieved matter to be continuous like a block\nof wood, wher eas, the other thought that matter\nwas made up of particles like sand. Let us\nperform an activity to decide about the natur e\nof matter  — is it continuous or particulate?Activity ______________ 1.1\n•Take a 100 mL beaker .\n•Fill half the beaker with water and\nmark the level of water .\n•Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help\nof a glass r od.\n•Observe any change in water level.\n•What do you think has happened to\nthe salt?\n•Wher e does it disappear?\n•Does the level of water change?\nIn or der to answer these questions we\nneed to use the idea that matter is made up\nof particles.

With every dilution, though the colour\nbecomes light, it is still visible.\nThis experiment shows that just a few\ncrystals of potassium per manganate can\ncolour a lar ge volume of water (about\n1000 L).

As the temperatur e rises,\nparticles move faster . So, we can say that with\nincrease in temperatur e the kinetic ener gy of\nthe particles also incr eases.\nIn the above thr ee activities we observe\nthat particles of matter inter mix on their own\nwith each other . They do so by getting into\nthe spaces between the particles. This\nintermixing of particles of two dif ferent types\nof matter on their own is called dif fusion.

W e can see that\nmatter ar ound us exists in thr ee dif ferent\nstates– solid, liquid and gas. These states of\nmatter arise due to the variation in the\ncharacteristics of the particles of matter .\nNow, let us study about the pr operties of\nthese thr ee states of matter in detail.\n1.3.1 THE SOLID  STATE\nActivity _____________  1.9\n•Collect the following articles — a pen,\na book, a needle and a piece of wooden\nstick.\n•Sketch the shape of the above articles\nin your notebook by moving a pencil\naround them.\n•Do all these have a definite shape,\ndistinct boundaries and a fixed volume?\n•What happens if they are hammered,\npulled or dr opped?\n•Are these capable of dif fusing into each\nother?\n•Try compr essing them by applying\nforce. Ar e you able to compr ess them?\nAll the above ar e examples of solids. W e\ncan observe that all these have a definite\nshape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\nthat is, have negligible compr essibility. Solids\nhave a tendency to maintain their shape when\nsubjected to outside for ce. Solids may br eak\nunder for ce but it is dif ficult to change their\nshape, so they ar e rigid.\nConsider the following:\n(a)What about a rubber band, can it\nchange its shape on str etching? Is it\na solid?\n(b)What about sugar and salt? When\nkept in dif ferent jars these take the\nshape of the jar . Are they solid?\n(c)What about a sponge? It is a solid\nyet we ar e able to compr\ness it. Why?\nAll the above ar e solids as:\n•A rubber band changes shape under\nforce and regains the same shape whenthe force is removed. If excessive force is\napplied, it breaks.\n•The shape of each individual sugar or\nsalt crystal r emains fixed, whether we\ntake it in our hand, put it in a plate or in\na jar.\n•A sponge has minute holes, in which\nair is trapped, when we pr ess it, the air\nis expelled out and we ar e able to\ncompr ess it.\n1.3.2 THE LIQUID  STATE\nActivity _____________ 1.10\n•Collect the following:\n(a)water , cooking oil, milk, juice, a\ncold drink.\n(b)containers of dif ferent shapes. Put\na 50 mL mark on these containers\nusing a measuring cylinder fr om\nthe laboratory.\n•What will happen if these liquids ar e\nspilt on the floor?\n•Measur e 50 mL of any one liquid and\ntransfer it into dif ferent containers one\nby one. Does the volume r emain the\nsame?\n•Does the shape of the liquid r emain the\nsame ?\n•When you pour the liquid fr om one\ncontainer into another , does it flow\neasily?\nWe observe that liquids have no fixed\nshape but have a fixed volume. They take up\nthe shape of the container in which they ar e\nkept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\nare not rigid but can be called fluid.\nRefer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 wher e we\nsaw that solids and liquids can dif fuse into\nliquids. The gases fr om the atmosphere\ndiffuse and dissolve in water . These gases,\nespecially oxygen and carbon dioxide, ar e\nessential for the survival of aquatic animals\nand plants.\nAll living cr eatur es need to br eathe for\nsurvival. The aquatic animals can br eathe\nunder water due to the pr esence of dissolved\noxygen  in water . Thus, we may conclude that\nsolids, liquids and gases can diffuse into\nliquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATTER IN OUR SURROUNDING S 5higher  than that of solids.  This is due to the\nfact that in the liquid state, particles move\nfreely and have greater space between each\nother as compared to particles in the solid\nstate.\n1.3.3 THE GASEOUS  STATE\nHave you ever observed a balloon seller filling\na lar ge number of balloons fr om a single\ncylinder of gas? Enquire fr om him how many\nballoons is he able to fill fr om one cylinder .\nAsk him which gas does he have in the cylinder .\nActivity _____________ 1.11\n•Take thr ee 100 mL syringes and close\ntheir nozzles by  rubber corks, as\nshown in Fig.1.4.\n•Remove the pistons fr om all the\nsyringes.\n•Leaving one syringe untouched, fill\nwater in the second and pieces of chalk\nin the thir d.\n•Insert the pistons back into the\nsyringes. Y ou may apply some vaseline\non the pistons befor e inserting them\ninto the syringes for their smooth\nmovement.\n•Now, try to compr ess the content by\npushing the piston in each syringe.We have observed that gases ar e highly\ncompr essible as compared to solids and\nliquids. The liquefied petr oleum gas (LPG)\ncylinder that we get in our home for cooking\nor the oxygen supplied to hospitals in\ncylinders is compr essed gas. Compr essed\nnatural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days\nin vehicles. Due to its high compr essibility,\nlarge volumes of a gas can be compr essed\ninto a small cylinder and transported easily.\nWe  come to know of what is being cooked\nin the kitchen without even entering ther e,\nby the smell that r\neaches our nostrils. How\ndoes this smell reach us? The particles of the\naroma of food mix with the particles of air\nspread fr om the kitchen, r each us and even\nfarther away. The smell of hot cooked food\nreaches us in seconds; compare this with the\nrate of dif fusion of solids and liquids. Due to\nhigh speed of particles and lar ge space\nbetween   them, gases show the pr operty of\ndiffusing very fast into other gases.\nIn the gaseous state, the particles move\nabout randomly at high speed. Due to this\nrandom movement, the particles hit each\nother and also the walls of the container . The\npressur e exerted by the gas is because of this\nforce exerted by gas particles per unit ar ea\non the walls of the container .\nFig. 1.4\n•What do you observe?

What happens to the\nparticles of matter during the change of\nstates? How does this change of state take\nplace? W e need answers to these questions,\nisn’t it?Q\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 1.6: (a) Conversion of ice to water , (b) conversion\nof water to water vapour\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATTER IN OUR SURROUNDING S 7•Start heating the beaker on a low flame.\n•Note the temperature when the ice\nstarts melting.\n•Note the temperatur e when all the ice\nhas converted into water .\n•Recor d your observations for this\nconversion of solid to liquid state.\n•Now, put a glass r od in the beaker and\nheat while stirring till the water starts\nboiling.\n•Keep a car eful eye on the ther mometer\nreading till most of the water has\nvaporised.\n•Recor d your observations for the\nconversion of water in the liquid state\nto the gaseous state.\nOn increasing the temperatur e of solids,\nthe kinetic ener gy of the particles incr eases.\nDue to the incr ease in kinetic ener gy, the\nparticles start vibrating with gr\neater speed.\nThe ener gy supplied by heat overcomes the\nforces of attraction between the particles. The\nparticles leave their fixed positions and start\nmoving mor e freely. A stage is reached when\nthe solid melts and is converted to a liquid.\nThe minimum temperature at which a solid\nmelts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\npressure is called its melting point.\nThe melting point of a solid is an indication\nof the strength of the force of attraction\nbetween its particles.\nThe melting point of ice is 273.15 K *. The\nprocess of melting, that is, change of solid\nstate into liquid state is also known as fusion.\nWhen a solid melts, its temperature\nremains the same, so where does the heat\nenergy go?\nYou must have observed, during the\nexperiment of melting, that the temperatur e\nof the system does not change after the\nmelting point is reached, till all the ice melts.\nThis happens even though we continue to\nheat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\nheat. This heat gets used up in changing thestate by overcoming the forces of attraction\nbetween the particles. As this heat energy is\nabsorbed by ice without showing any rise in\ntemperatur e, it is consider ed that it gets\nhidden into the contents of the beaker and is\nknown as the latent heat. The wor d latent\nmeans hidden. The amount of heat ener gy\nthat is r equir ed to change 1 kg of a solid into\nliquid at atmospheric pr essur e at its melting\npoint is known as the latent heat of fusion.\nSo, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more\nenergy as compared to particles in ice at the\nsame temperature.\nWhen we supply heat ener gy to water ,\nparticles start moving even faster .  At a certain\ntemperatur e, a point is r eached when the\nparticles have enough energy to break fr ee\nfrom the forces of attraction of each other . At\nthis temperatur e the liquid starts changing\ninto gas. The temperature at which a liquid\nstarts boiling at the atmospheric pr essur e is\nknown as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk\nphenomenon. Particles fr om the bulk of the\nliquid gain enough ener gy to change into the\nvapour state.\nFor water this temperature is 373 K\n(100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K).\nCan you define the latent heat of\nvaporisation? Do it in the same way as we\nhave defined the latent heat of fusion.\nParticles in steam, that is, water vapour at\n373 K (1000 C) have mor e ener gy than water\nat the same temperatur e. This is because\nparticles in steam have absorbed extra ener gy\nin the for m of latent heat of vaporisation.\n*Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after\nrounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you\nhave to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius\nscale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.So, we infer that the state of matter can\nbe changed into another state by changing\nthe temperature.\nWe have lear nt that substances ar ound\nus change state fr om solid to liquid and fr om\nliquid to gas on application of heat. But there\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 8enclosed in a cylinder? Will the particles come\ncloser? Do you think that increasing or\ndecreasing the pressure can change the state\nof matter?are some that change directly from solid state\nto gaseous state and vice versa without\nchanging into the liquid state.\nActivity _____________ 1.13\n•Take some camphor . Crush it and put\nit in a china dish.\n•Put an inverted funnel over the china\ndish.\n•Put a cotton plug on the stem of the\nfunnel, as shown in Fig. 1.7.\n* atmospher e (atm) is a unit of measuring pr essur e exerted by a gas. The unit of pr essur e is Pascal (Pa):\n1 atmospher e = 1.01 × 105 Pa. The pr essur e of air in atmospher e is called atmospheric pr essur e.

If the surface area is\nincreased, the rate of evaporation\nincreases. F or example, while putting\nclothes for drying up we spread them\nout.\n•an increase of temperature:\nWith the increase of temperature, more\nnumber of particles get enough kinetic\nenergy to go into the vapour state.\n•a decrease in humidity:\nHumidity is the amount of water vapour\npresent in air . The air around us cannot\nhold more than a definite amount of\nwater vapour at a given temperature. If\nthe amount of water in air is already\nhigh, the rate of evaporation decreases.\n•an increase in wind speed:\nIt is a common observation that clothes\ndry faster on a windy day . With the\nincrease in wind speed, the particles of\nwater vapour move away with the wind,\ndecreasing the amount of water vapour\nin the surrounding.\n1.5.2 HOW DOES EVAPORATION  CAUSE\nCOOLING ?\nIn an open vessel, the liquid keeps on\nevaporating.

W ater, when left uncovered, slowly\nchanges into vapour . Wet clothes dry up. What\nhappens to water in the above two examples?\nWe know that particles of matter are\nalways moving and are never at rest. At a given\ntemperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there\nare particles with different amounts of kinetic\nenergy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction\nof particles at the surface, having higher\nkinetic energy, is able to break away from the\nforces of attraction of other particles and gets\nconverted into vapour . This phenomenon of\nchange of  liquid into vapours at any\ntemperature below its boiling point is called\nevaporation.\n1.5.1 FACTORS  AFFECTING  EVAPORATION\nLet us understand this with an activity .\nActivity _____________ 1.14\n•Take 5 mL of water in a test tube and\nkeep it near a window or under a fan.\n•Take 5 mL of water in an open china\ndish and keep it near a window or\nunder a fan.\n•Take 5 mL of water in an open china\ndish and keep it inside a cupboard or\non a shelf in your class.Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 10What\nyou have\nlearnt\n• Matter is made up of small particles.\n• The matter around us exists in three states—solid, liquid\nand gas.\n• The forces of attraction between the particles are maximum in\nsolids, inter mediate in liquids and minimum in gases.\n• The spaces in between the constituent particles and kinetic\nenergy of the particles ar e minimum in the case of solids,\nintermediate in liquids and maximum in gases.What happens when you pour some\nacetone (nail polish remover) on your palm?\nThe particles gain energy from your palm or\nsurroundings and evaporate causing the palm\nto feel cool.\nAfter a hot sunny day, people sprinkle\nwater on the r oof or open gr ound because\nthe lar\nge latent heat of vaporisation of water\nhelps to cool the hot sur face.\nCan you cite some mor e examples fr om\ndaily life wher e we can feel the ef fect of cooling\ndue to evaporation?\nWhy should we wear cotton clothes in\nsummer?\nDuring summer , we perspir e mor e\nbecause of the mechanism of our body which\nkeeps us cool.

{"class": "9", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 2: is matter around us pure", "content": "Fig. 2.1:  Some consumable items\nHave you ever noticed the word ‘pure’\nwritten on the packs of these consumables?\nFor a common person pure means having no\nadulteration. But, for a scientist all these things\nare actually mixtures of different substances\nand hence not pure. For example, milk is\nactually a mixtur e of water , fat, pr oteins, etc.\nWhen a scientist says that something is pure,\nit means that all the constituent particles of\nthat substance are the same in their chemical\nnature. A pure substance consists of a single\ntype of particle. In other words, a substance is\na pur e single for m of matter .\nAs we look around, we can see that most\nof the matter around us exists as mixtures of\ntwo or more pure components, for example,\nsea water , minerals, soil, etc., ar e all mixtur es.\n2.1 What is a Mixture?\nMixtures  are constituted by more than one\nkind of pur e form of matter . We know that\ndissolved sodium chloride can be separated\nfrom water by the physical process of\nevaporation. However , sodium chloride is itselfa pure substance and cannot be separated by\nphysical process into its chemical constituents.\nSimilarly, sugar is a substance which contains\nonly one kind of pure matter and its\ncomposition is the same throughout.\nSoft drink and soil are not single pure\nsubstances. Whatever the source of a\npure substance may be, it will always have\nthe same characteristic properties.\nTherefore, we can say that a mixture\ncontains more than one pure substance.\n2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES\nDepending upon the nature of the components\nthat form a mixture, we can have different\ntypes of mixtures.\nActivity ______________ 2.1\n•Let us divide the class into groups A,\nB, C and D.\n•Group A takes a beaker containing\n50 mL of water and one spatula full\nof copper sulphate powder .

Such\nmixtures are called homogeneous\nmixtures or solutions. Some other\nexamples of such mixtures are: (i) salt\ndissolved in water and (ii) sugar\ndissolved in water .

Though both the groups have\nobtained copper sulphate solution but\nthe intensity of colour of the solutions\nis different. This shows that a\nhomogeneous mixture can have a\nvariable composition.\n•Groups C and D have obtained\nmixtures, which contain physically\ndistinct parts and have non-uniform\ncompositions. Such mixtures are called\nheterogeneous mixtures. Mixtures of\nsodium chloride and iron filings, salt\nand sulphur , and oil and water ar e\nexamples of heterogeneous mixtures.\nActivity ______________ 2.2\n•Let us again divide the class into four\ngroups— A, B, C and D.\n•Distribute the following samples to\neach group:\n−Few crystals of copper sulphate\nto group A.\n−One spatula full of copper\nsulphate to group B.\n−Chalk powder or wheat flour to\ngroup C.\n−Few drops of milk or ink to\ngroup D.\n•Each group should add the given\nsample in water and stir properly\nusing a glass rod.

Y ou come acr oss various\ntypes of solutions in your daily life. Lemonade,\nsoda water , etc., ar e all examples of solutions.\nUsually we think of a solution as a liquid that\ncontains either a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved\nin it. But, we can also have solid solutions\n(alloys) and gaseous solutions (air). In a\nsolution there is homogeneity at the particle\nlevel. For example, lemonade tastes the same\nthroughout. This shows that particles of sugar\nor salt are evenly distributed in\nthe solution.Q\nFig. 2.2:  Filtration\nAlloys : Alloys are mixtures of two or\nmore metals or ametal and  a non-metal\nand cannot be separated into their\ncomponents by physical methods. But\nstill, an alloy is considered as a mixture\nbecause it shows the properties of its\nconstituents and can have variable\ncomposition. For example, brass is a\nmixture of approximately 30% zinc and\n70% copper .\nIS MATTER AROUND  US\n PURE? 15\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 16A solution has a solvent and a solute as its\ncomponents.  The component of the solution\nthat dissolves the other component in it\n(usually the component present in larger\namount) is called the solvent.  The component\nof the solution that is dissolved in the solvent\n(usually present in lesser quantity) is called\nthe solute.\nExamples:\n(i)A solution of sugar in water is a  solid\nin liquid solution. In this solution,\nsugar is the solute and water is\nthe solvent.\n(ii)A solution of iodine in alcohol known\nas ‘tincture of iodine’, has iodine (solid)\nas the solute and alcohol (liquid) as the\nsolvent.\n(iii)Aerated drinks like soda water , etc., ar e\ngas in liquid solutions. These contain\ncarbon dioxide (gas) as solute and water\n(liquid) as solvent.\n(iv)Air is a mixture of gas in gas. Air is a\nhomogeneous mixture of a number of\ngases. Its two main constituents are:\noxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%). The\nother gases are present in very\nsmall quantities.\nProperties of a Solution\n•A solution is a homogeneous mixture.\n•The particles of a solution are smaller\nthan 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter . So,\nthey cannot be seen by naked eyes.\n•Because of very small particle size, they\ndo not scatter a beam of light passing\nthrough the solution. So, the path of\nlight is not visible in a solution.\n•The solute particles cannot be separated\nfrom the mixture by the process of\nfiltration. The solute particles do not\nsettle down when left undisturbed , that\nis, a solution is stable.\n2.2.1 C ONCENTRATION  OF A SOLUTION\nIn activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and\nB obtained different shades of solutions. So,\nwe understand that in a solution the relativeproportion of the solute and solvent can be\nvaried. Depending upon the amount of solute\npresent in a solution, it can be called  dilute,\nconcentrated or  saturated solution. Dilute\nand concentrated are comparative terms. In\nactivity 2.2, the solution obtained by group\nA is dilute as compared to that obtained by\ngroup B.\nActivity ______________ 2.3\n•Take approximately 50 mL of water\neach in two separate beakers.\n•Add salt in one beaker and sugar or\nbarium chloride in the second beaker\nwith continuous stirring.\n•When no more solute can be dissolved,\nheat the contents of the beaker to raise\nthe temperature by about 5oC.°\n•Start adding the solute again.\nIs the amount of salt and sugar or barium\nchloride, that can be dissolved in water  at a\ngiven temperature, the same?\nAt any particular temperature, a solution\nthat has dissolved as much solute as it is\ncapable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated\nsolution. In other words, when no more solute\ncan be dissolved in a solution at a given\ntemperature, it is called a saturated solution.\nThe amount of the solute present in the\nsaturated solution at this temperature is called\nits solubility.\nIf the amount of solute contained in a\nsolution is less than the saturation level, it is\ncalled an unsaturated solution.\nWhat would happen if you were to take a\nsaturated solution at a certain temperature\nand cool it slowly.\nWe can infer fr\nom the above activity that\ndifferent substances in a given solvent have\ndifferent solubilities at the same temperature.\nThe concentration of a solution is the amount\n(mass or volume) of solute present in a given\namount (mass or volume) of solution .\nThere are various ways of expressing the\nconcentration of a solution, but here we will\nlearn only three methods.\n(i)Mass by mass percentage of a solution\nMass of solute= ×100\nMass of solution\nReprint 2025-26\n\nIS MATTER AROUND  US PURE? 17(ii)Mass by volume percentage of a solution\nMass of solute= ×100\nVolume of solution\n(iii)Volume by volume per centage of a\nsolution\nVolume of solute= ×100\nVolume of solution\nExample 2.1 A solution contains 40 g of\ncommon salt in 320 g of water .

A suspension is a heterogeneous\nmixture in which the solute  particles do not\ndissolve but remain suspended throughout\nthe bulk of the medium. Particles of a\nsuspension are visible to the naked eye.\nProperties of a Suspension\n•Suspension is a heterogeneous\nmixture.\n•The particles of a suspension can be seen\nby the naked eye.•The particles of a suspension scatter a\nbeam of light passing through it and\nmake its path visible.\n•The solute particles settle down when a\nsuspension is left undisturbed, that is,\na suspension is unstable. They can be\nseparated from the mixture by the\nprocess of filtration. When the particles\nsettle down, the suspension breaks and\nit does not scatter light any more.\n2.2.3 WHAT IS \nA COLLOIDAL SOLUTION?\nThe mixture obtained by group D in activity\n2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution.\nThe particles of a colloid are uniformly spread\nthroughout the solution. Due to the relatively\nsmaller size of particles, as compared to that of\na suspension, the mixture appears to be\nhomogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution\nis a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk.\nBecause of the small size of colloidal\nparticles, we cannot see them with naked eyes.\nBut, these particles can easily scatter a beam\nof visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This\nscattering of a beam of light is called the\nTyndall effect after the name of the scientist\nwho discovered this effect.\nTyndall effect can also be observed when a\nfine beam of light enters a room through a small\nhole. This happens due to the scattering of light\nby the particles of dust and smoke in the air .\nFig. 2.3: (a) Solution of copper sulphate does not\nshow Tyndall effect, (b) mixture of water\nand milk shows Tyndall effect.(a) (b)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 18 18181818Q•Colloids are big enough to scatter a\nbeam of light passing through it and\nmake its path visible.\n•They do not settle down when left\nundisturbed, that is, a colloid is quite\nstable.\n•They cannot be separated from the\nmixture by the process of filtration. But,\na special technique of separation known\nas centrifugation can be used to\nseparate the colloidal particles.\nThe components of a colloidal solution are\nthe dispersed phase and the dispersion\nmedium. The solute-like component or the\ndispersed particles in a colloid form the\ndispersed phase, and the component in which\nthe dispersed phase is suspended is known\nas the dispersing medium. Colloids are\nclassified according to the state (solid, liquid\nor gas) of the dispersing medium and  the\ndispersed phase. A few common examples are\ngiven in Table 2.1. From this table you can\nsee that they are very common everyday life.Tyndall effect can be observed when\nsunlight passes through the canopy of a dense\nforest. In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets\nof water , which act as particles of colloid\ndispersed in air .\nFig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4:Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4:Fig. 2.4:  The Tyndall effect\nuestions\n1.Differentiate between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures with examples.\n2.How are sol, solution and suspension different from each other?\n3.To make a saturated solution,  36 g of sodium chloride is dissolved in 100 g of water\nat 293 K.

The\nproperties that can be observed and specified\nlike colour , har dness, rigidity, fluidity,\ndensity, melting point, boiling point etc. are\nthe physical properites.\nThe interconversion of states is a physical\nchange because these changes occur without\na change in composition and no change in the\nchemical nature of the substance. Although\nice, water and water vapour all look different\nand display different physical properties, they\nare chemically the same.\nBoth water and cooking oil  are liquid but\ntheir chemical characteristics are different.\nThey dif fer in odour and inflammability. W e\nknow that oil burns in air whereas water\nextinguishes fire. It is this chemical property\nof oil that makes it dif ferent fr\nom water .\nBurning is a chemical change. During this\nprocess one substance reacts with another to\nundergo a change in chemical composition.\nChemical change brings change in the\nchemical properties of matter and we get new\nsubstances. A chemical change is also called\na chemical reaction.\nDuring burning of a candle, both physical\nand chemical changes take place. Can you\ndistinguish these?\nuestions\n1.Classify the following as chemical\nor physical changes:\n•cutting of trees,\n•melting of butter in a pan,\n•rusting of almirah,\n•boiling of water to form steam,\n•passing of electric current,\nthrough water and the water\nbreaking down into hydrogen\nand oxygen gases,\n•dissolving common salt in\nwater ,\n•making a fruit salad with raw\nfruits, andQ•burning of paper and wood.\n2.Try segr egating the things\naround you as pure substances\nor mixtures.\n2.4What are the Types of Pure\nSubstances?\nOn the basis of their chemical composition,\nsubstances can be classified either as elements\nor compounds.\n2.4.1 ELEMENTS\nRobert Boyle was the first scientist to use the\nterm element in 1661. Antoine Laurent\nLavoisier (1743–94), a French chemist, was the\nfirst to establish an experimentally useful\ndefinition of an element. He defined an element\nas a basic form of matter that cannot be broken\ndown into simpler substances by chemical\nreactions.\nElements can be normally divided into\nmetals, non-metals and metalloids.\nMetals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n•They have a lustre (shine).\n•They have silvery-grey or golden-yellow\ncolour .\n•They conduct heat and electricity.\n•They are ductile (can be drawn into\nwires).\n•They are malleable (can be hammered\ninto thin sheets).\n•They are sonorous (make a ringing\nsound when hit).\nExamples of metals ar e gold, silver ,\ncopper , iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mer cury\nis the only metal that is liquid at room\ntemperature.\nNon-metals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n•They display a variety of colours.\n•They are poor conductors of heat and\nelectricity.\n•They are not lustrous, sonorous\nor malleable.\nExamples of non-metals are hydrogen,\noxygen, iodine, carbon (coal, coke), bromine,\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 20chlorine etc. Some elements have intermediate\nproperties between those of metals and non-\nmetals, they are  called metalloids; examples\nare boron, silicon, germanium, etc.\nMore to  know\n2.4.2 COMPOUNDS\nA compound is a substance composed of two\nor more elements, chemically combined with\none another in a fixed proportion.\nWhat do we get when two or more elements\nare combined?\nActivity ______________ 2.4\n•Divide the class into two groups.

Heat this mixtur e\nstrongly till red hot. Remove from\nflame and let the mixture cool.\nGroups I and II\n•Check for magnetism in the material\nobtained. Bring a magnet near the\nmaterial and check if the material is\nattracted towards the magnet.•Compare the texture and colour of the\nmaterial obtained by the groups.\n•Add carbon disulphide to one part of\nthe  material obtained. Stir well\nand filter .\n•Add dilute sulphuric acid or dilute\nhydrochloric acid to the other part of\nthe material obtained. (Note: teacher\nsupervision is necessary for\nthis activity).\n•Perform all the above steps with both\nthe elements (iron and sulphur)\nseparately.\nNow answer\n•Did the material obtained by the two\ngroups look the same?\n•Which group has obtained a material\nwith magnetic properties?\n•Can we separate the components of the\nmaterial obtained?\n•On adding dilute sulphuric acid or\ndilute hydrochloric acid, did both the\ngroups obtain a gas? Did the gas in\nboth the cases smell the same\nor different?\nThe gas obtained by Group I is hydrogen,\nit is colourless, odourless and combustible– it\nis not advised to do the combustion test for\nhydrogen in the class. The gas obtained by\nGroup II is hydrogen sulphide. It is a colourless\ngas with the smell of rotten eggs.\nYou must have observed that the pr oducts\nobtained by both the groups show different\nproperties, though the starting materials were\nthe same.

The idea of divisibility\nof matter was consider ed long back in India,\naround 500 BC. An Indian philosopher\nMaharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on\ndividing matter ( padarth ), we shall get smaller\nand smaller particles. Ultimately, a stage will\ncome when we shall come across the smallest\nparticles beyond which further division will\nnot be possible.  He named these particles\nParmanu . Another Indian philosopher ,\nPakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine\nand said that these particles nor mally exist\nin a combined for m which gives us various\nforms of matter .\nAround the same era, ancient Gr eek\nphilosophers – Democritus and Leucippus\nsuggested that if we go on dividing matter , a\nstage will come when particles obtained\ncannot be divided further . Democritus called\nthese indivisible particles atoms (meaning\nindivisible). All this was based on\nphilosophical considerations and not much\nexperimental work to validate these ideas\ncould be done till the eighteenth century.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century,\nscientists r\necognised the dif ference between\nelements and compounds and naturally\nbecame inter ested in finding out how and why\nelements combine and what happens when\nthey combine.\nAntoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation\nof chemical sciences by establishing two\nimportant laws of chemical combination.\n3.1Laws of Chemical Combination\nThe following two laws of chemical\ncombination were established aftermuch experimentations by Lavoisier and\nJoseph L. Proust.\n3.1.1 LAW OF CONSERVATION  OF MASS\nIs there a change in mass when a chemical\nchange (chemical reaction) takes place?\nActivity ______________ 3.1\n•Take one of the following sets, X and Y\nof chemicals—\nX Y\n(i)copper sulphate sodium carbonate\n(ii)barium chloride sodium sulphate\n(iii) lead nitrate sodium chloride\n•Prepare separately a 5% solution of\nany one pair of substances listed\nunder X and Y each in 10 mL in water .\n•Take a little amount of solution of Y in\na conical flask and some solution of\nX in an ignition tube.\n•Hang the ignition tube in the flask\ncarefully; see that the solutions do not\nget mixed.

Thus,\nif 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen\nand 8 g of oxygen are always obtained.\nSimilarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen\nare always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass,\nwhatever the method or the source from which\nit is obtained.\nThis led to the law of constant proportions\nwhich is also known as the law of definite\nproportions. This law was stated by Proust as\n“In a chemical substance the elements are\nalways present in definite proportions by\nmass ”.\nThe next problem faced by scientists was\nto give appropriate explanations of these laws.\nBritish chemist John Dalton provided the\nbasic theory about the natur e of matter .\nDalton picked up the idea of divisibility of\nmatter , which was till then just a philosophy.\nHe took the name ‘atoms’ as given by the\nGreeks and said that the smallest particles of\nmatter are atoms. His theory was based on the\nlaws of chemical combination. Dalton’s atomic\ntheory provided an explanation for the law ofconservation of mass and the law of\ndefinite proportions.\nJohn Dalton was born in\na poor weaver’s family in\n1766 in England. He\nbegan his car eer as a\nteacher at the age of\ntwelve. Seven years later\nhe became a school\nprincipal. In 1793, Dalton\nleft for Manchester to\nteach mathematics,\nphysics and chemistry in\na college. He spent most of his life there\nteaching and researching. In 1808, he\npresented his atomic theory which was a\nturning point in the study of matter .\nAccording to Dalton’s atomic theory, all\nmatter , whether an element, a compound or\na mixtur e is composed of small particles called\natoms. The postulates of this theory may be\nstated as follows:\n(i)All matter is made of very tiny particles\ncalled atoms, which participate in\nchemical reactions.\n(ii)Atoms are indivisible particles, which\ncannot be cr eated or destr oyed in a\nchemical r eaction.\n(iii) Atoms of a given element ar e identical\nin mass and chemical pr operties.\n(iv)Atoms of dif ferent elements have\ndifferent masses and chemical\nproperties.\n(v)Atoms combine in the ratio of small\nwhole numbers to for m compounds.\n(vi)The r elative number and kinds of\natoms are constant in a given\ncompound.\nYou will study in the next chapter that all\natoms are made up of still smaller particles.\n uestions\n1.In a r eaction, 5.3 g of sodium\ncarbonate reacted with 6 g of\nacetic acid.

Berzilius\nsuggested that the symbols of elements be\nmade from one or two letters of the name of\nthe element.\nFig. 3.3: Symbols for some elements as pr oposed by\nDalton\nReprint 2025-26\n\nATOMS AND MOLECULES 29In the beginning, the names of elements\nwere derived from the name of the place\nwhere they were found for the first time. For\nexample, the name copper was taken from\nCyprus. Some names were taken from\nspecific colours. For example, gold was taken\nfrom the English word meaning yellow.\nNow-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of\nPure and Applied Chemistry) is an\ninternational scientific organisation which\napproves names of elements, symbols and\nunits. Many of the symbols are the first one\nor two letters of the element’s name in\nEnglish. The first letter of a symbol is always\nwritten as a capital letter (uppercase) and the\nsecond letter as a small letter (lowercase).\nFor example\n(i)hydrogen, H\n(ii)aluminium, Al and not AL\n(iii)cobalt, Co and not CO.\nSymbols of some elements are formed from\nthe first letter of the name and a letter ,\nappearing later in the name. Examples are: (i)\nchlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc.\nOther symbols have been taken from the\nnames of elements in Latin, German or Greek.\nFor example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its\nLatin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium,\npotassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each\nelement has a name and a unique\nchemical symbol.\n(The above table is given for you to refer to\nwhenever you study about elements. Do not\nbother to memorise all in one go. With thepassage of time and repeated usage you will\nautomatically be able to reproduce\nthe symbols).\n3.2.2 ATOMIC MASS\nThe most remarkable concept that Dalton’s\natomic theory proposed was that of the atomic\nmass. According to him, each element had a\ncharacteristic atomic mass. The theory could\nexplain the law of constant proportions so well\nthat scientists were prompted to measure the\natomic mass of an atom. Since determining the\nmass of an individual atom was a relatively\ndifficult task, relative atomic masses were\ndetermined using the laws of chemical\ncombinations and the compounds formed.\nLet us take the example of a compound,\ncarbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and\noxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3\ng of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to\nform CO. In other words, carbon combines\nwith 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose\nwe define the atomic mass unit (earlier\nabbreviated as ‘amu’, but according to the\nlatest IUPAC recommendations, it is now\nwritten as ‘u’ – unified mass) as equal to the\nmass of one carbon atom, then we would\nassign carbon an atomic mass of 1.0 u and\noxygen an atomic mass of 1.33 u. However , it\nis more convenient to have these numbers asTable 3.1: Symbols for some elements\nElement Symbol Element Symbol Element Symbol\nAluminium Al Copper Cu Nitrogen N\nArgon Ar Fluorine F Oxygen O\nBarium Ba Gold Au Potassium K\nBoron B Hydrogen H Silicon Si\nBromine Br Iodine I Silver Ag\nCalcium Ca Iron Fe Sodium Na\nCarbon C Lead Pb Sulphur S\nChlorine Cl Magnesium Mg Uranium U\nCobalt Co Neon Ne Zinc Zn\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 30whole numbers or as near to a whole numbers\nas possible. While sear ching for various\natomic mass units, scientists initially took 1/\n16 of the mass of an atom of naturally\noccurring oxygen as the unit. This was\nconsider ed relevant due to two r easons:\n•oxygen r eacted with a lar ge number of\nelements and for med compounds.\n•this atomic mass unit gave masses of\nmost of the elements as whole numbers.\nHowever , in 1961 for a universally\naccepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope\nwas chosen as the standar d reference for\nmeasuring atomic masses. One atomic mass\nunit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth\n(1/12th) the mass of one atom of carbon-12.\nThe r elative atomic masses of all elements\nhave been found with r espect to an atom of\ncarbon-12.\nImagine a fruit seller selling fruits without\nany standard weight with him. He takes a\nwater melon and says, “this has a mass equal\nto 12 units” (12 water melon units or 12 fruit\nmass units). He makes twelve equal pieces of\nthe watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit\nhe is selling, relative to the mass of one piece\nof the watermelon. Now he sells his fruits by\nrelative fruit mass unit (fmu), as in Fig. 3.4.\nFig. 3.4 : (a) W atermelon, (b) 12 pieces, (c) 1/12 of\nwatermelon, (d) how the fruit seller can\nweigh the fruits using pieces of watermelon\nSimilarly, the relative atomic mass of the\natom of an element is defined as the averagemass of the atom, as compared to 1/12th the\nmass of one carbon-12 atom.\nTable 3.2: Atomic masses of\na few elements\nElement Atomic Mass (u)\nHydrogen 1\nCarbon 12\nNitrogen 14\nOxygen 16\nSodium 23\nMagnesium 24\nSulphur 32\nChlorine 35.5\nCalcium 40\n3.2.3 HOW DO ATOMS\n EXIST ?\nAtoms of most elements are not able to exist\nindependently.

A molecule can be defined\nas the smallest particle of an element or a\ncompound that is capable of an independent\nexistence and shows all the properties of that\nsubstance. Atoms of the same element or of\ndifferent elements can join together to form\nmolecules.Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nATOMS AND MOLECULES 313.3.1 MOLECULES  OF  ELEMENTS\nThe molecules of an element are constituted\nby the same type of atoms. Molecules of many\nelements, such as ar gon (Ar), helium (He) etc.\nare made up of only one atom of that element.\nBut this is not the case with most of the non-\nmetals. For example, a molecule of oxygen\nconsists of two atoms of oxygen and hence it\nis known as a diatomic molecule, O2. If 3\natoms of oxygen unite into a molecule, instead\nof the usual 2, we get ozone, O3. The number\nof atoms constituting a molecule is known as\nits atomicity.\nMetals and some other elements, such as\ncarbon, do not have a simple structur e but\nconsist of a very lar ge and indefinite number\nof atoms bonded together .\nLet us look at the atomicity of some\nnon-metals.\nTable 3.3 : Atomicity of some\nelements\nType of Name Atomicity\nElement\nNon-Metal Argon Monoatomic\nHelium Monoatomic\nOxygen Diatomic\nHydrogen Diatomic\nNitrogen Diatomic\nChlorine Diatomic\nPhosphorus Tetra-atomic\nSulphur Poly-atomicTable 3.4 : Molecules of some\ncompounds\nCompound Combining Ratio\nElements   by\nMass\nWater (H2O) Hydrogen, Oxygen 1:8\nAmmonia (NH3)Nitrogen, Hydrogen 14:3\nCarbon\ndioxide (CO2)Carbon, Oxygen 3:8\nActivity ______________ 3.2\n•Refer to Table 3.4 for ratio by mass of\natoms pr esent in molecules and T able\n3.2 for atomic masses of elements.

The char\nged\nspecies are known as ions . Ions may consist\nof a single charged atom or a group of atoms\nthat have a net charge on them. An ion can be\nnegatively or positively charged. A negatively\ncharged ion is called an ‘anion’ and the\npositively charged ion, a ‘cation’. Take, for\nexample, sodium chloride (NaCl). Its\nconstituent particles are positively charged\nsodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged3.3.2 MOLECULES OF COMPOUNDS\nAtoms of different elements join together\nin definite proportions to form molecules\nof compounds.

V alency can\nbe used to find out how the atoms of an\nelement will combine with the atom(s) of\nanother element to form a chemical compound.\nThe valency of the atom of an element can be\nthought of as hands or arms of that atom.\nHuman beings have two arms and an\noctopus has eight.

{"class": "9", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 4: structure of the atom", "content": "In Chapter 3, we have lear nt that atoms and\nmolecules ar e the fundamental building\nblocks of matter . The existence of dif ferent\nkinds of matter is due to dif ferent atoms\nconstituting them. Now the questions arise:\n(i) What makes the atom of one element\ndiffer\nent fr om the atom of another element?\nand (ii) Ar e atoms r eally indivisible, as\nproposed by Dalton, or ar e ther e smaller\nconstituents inside the atom? W e shall find\nout the answers to these questions in this\nchapter . We will lear n about sub-atomic\nparticles and the various models that have\nbeen pr oposed to explain how these particles\nare arranged within the atom.\nA major challenge before the scientists at\nthe end of the 19th century was to r eveal the\nstructur e of the atom as well as to explain its\nimportant pr operties. The elucidation of the\nstructur e of atoms is based on a series of\nexperiments.\nOne of the first indications that atoms ar e\nnot indivisible, comes fr om studying static\nelectricity and the condition under which\nelectricity is conducted by dif ferent\nsubstances.\n4.1Charged Particles in Matter\nFor understanding the natur e of char ged\nparticles in matter , let us carry out the\nfollowing activities:\nActivity ______________ 4.1\nA.Comb dry hair . Does the comb then\nattract small pieces of paper?\nB.Rub a glass r od with a silk cloth and\nbring the r od near an inflated balloon.\nObserve what happens.From these activities, can we conclude\nthat on rubbing two objects together , they\nbecome electrically char ged? Wher e does this\ncharge come fr om? This question can be\nanswer ed by knowing that an atom is divisible\nand consists of char ged particles.\nMany scientists contributed in r evealing\nthe pr esence of charged particles in an atom.\nIt was known by 1900 that the atom was\nindivisible particle but contained at least one\nsub-atomic particle – the electron identified by\nJ.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was\nidentified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the\npresence of new radiations  in a gas discharge\nand called them canal rays. These rays were\npositively charged radiations which ultimately\nled to the discovery of another sub-atomic\nparticle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge,\nequal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that\nof the electron. Its mass was approximately\n2000 times as that of the electron. It was given\nthe name of proton. In general, an electron is\nrepresented as ‘e–’ and a proton as ‘p+’. The\nmass of a proton  is taken as one unit and its\ncharge as plus one. The mass of an electron is\nconsidered to be negligible and its charge is\nminus one.\nIt seemed that an atom was composed of\nprotons and electrons, mutually balancing\ntheir charges. It also appeared that the protons\nwere in the interior of the atom, for whereas\nelectrons could easily be removed off but\nnot protons. Now the big question was:\nwhat sort of structure did  these particles of\nthe atom for m? W e will find the answer to\nthis question below.4\nS SS SSTRUCTURETRUCTURETRUCTURETRUCTURETRUCTURE      OF OFOF OFOF     THE THETHE THETHE A  A A  A ATOM TOMTOM TOMTOMChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\nuestions\n1.What are canal rays?\n2.If an atom contains one electron\nand one pr oton, will it carry any\ncharge or not?\n4.2The Structure of an Atom\nWe have lear nt Dalton’s atomic theory in\nChapter 3, which suggested that the atom\nwas indivisible and indestructible. But the\ndiscovery of two fundamental particles\n(electr ons and pr otons) inside the atom, led\nto the failur e of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic\ntheory. It was then consider ed necessary to\nknow how electr ons and pr otons ar e arranged\nwithin an atom. For explaining this, many\nscientists pr oposed various atomic models.\nJ.J. Thomson was the first one to pr opose a\nmodel for the structure of an atom.\n4.2.1 THOMSON ’S MODEL  OF AN ATOM\nThomson proposed the model of an atom to\nbe similar to that of a Christmas pudding.\nThe electrons, in a spher e of positive charge,\nwere like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical\nChristmas pudding. W e can also think of a\nwater melon, the positive char ge in the atom\nis spr ead all over like the r ed edible part of\nthe water melon, while the electr ons ar e\nstudded in the positively char ged spher e, like\nthe seeds in the water melon (Fig. 4.1).Thomson pr oposed that:\n(i)An atom consists of a positively\ncharged spher e and the electr ons ar e\nembedded in it.\n(ii)The negative and positive char ges ar e\nequal in magnitude. So, the atom as a\nwhole is electrically neutral.\nAlthough Thomson’s model explained that\natoms ar e electrically neutral, the results of\nexperiments carried out by other scientists\ncould not be explained by this model, as we\nwill see below.\n4.2.2 RUTHERFORD ’S MODEL  OF AN ATOM\nErnest Ruther ford was inter ested in knowing\nhow the electr ons ar e arranged within an\natom. Ruther ford designed an experiment for\nthis. In this experiment, fast moving alpha\n(α)-particles wer e made to fall on a thin\ngold foil.\n•He selected a gold foil because he wanted\nas thin a layer as possible. This gold foil\nwas about 1000 atoms thick.\n•α-particles ar e doubly-char ged helium\nions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the\nfast-moving α-particles have a\nconsiderable amount of ener gy.\n•It was expected that α-particles would be\ndeflected by the sub-atomic particles in\nthe gold atoms. Since the α-particles wer e\nmuch heavier than the pr otons, he did\nnot expect to see lar ge deflections.Q\nFig.4.1:  Thomson’s model of an atomJ.J. Thomson (1856–\n1940),  a British\nphysicist, was born in\nCheetham Hill, a suburb\nof Manchester , on\n18 December 1856. He\nwas awarded the Nobel\nprize in Physics in 1906\nfor his work on the\ndiscovery of electrons. He\ndirected the Cavendish Laboratory at\nCambridge for 35 years and seven of his\nresearch assistants subsequently won\nNobel prizes.\nSTRUCTURE  OF THE ATOM 39\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 40Fig. 4.2: Scattering of α-particles by a gold foil\nBut, the α -particle scatterin g experiment\ngave totally unexpected r esults (Fig. 4.2).  The\nfollowing observations wer e made:\n(i)Most of the fast moving α-particles\npassed straight thr ough the gold foil.\n(ii)Some of the α-particles were deflected\nby the foil by small angles.\n(iii) Surprisingly one out of every 12000\nparticles appear ed to rebound.\nIn the wor ds of Ruther ford, “This r esult\nwas almost as incr edible as if you fir e a\n15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it\ncomes back and hits you ”.He will hear a sound when each stone strikes\nthe wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will\nhear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded\nchild were to throw stones at a barbed-wire\nfence, most of the stones would not hit the\nfencing and no sound would be heard. This is\nbecause there are lots of gaps in the fence\nwhich allow the stone to pass through them.\nFollowing a similar reasoning, Rutherford\nconcluded fr om the α-particle scattering\nexperiment that—\n(i)Most of the space inside the atom is\nempty because most of the α -particles\npassed thr ough the gold foil without\ngetting deflected.\n(ii) V ery few particles were deflected fr om\ntheir path, indicating that the positive\ncharge of the atom occupies very little\nspace.\n(iii) A very small fraction of α-particles\nwere deflected by 1800, indicating that\nall the positive char ge and mass of the\ngold atom were concentrated in a very\nsmall volume within the atom.\nFrom the data he also calculated that the\nradius of the nucleus is about 105 times less\nthan the radius of the atom.\nOn the basis of his experiment,\nRuther ford put forwar d the nuclear model of\nan atom, which had the following featur es:\n(i)There is a positively char ged centr e in\nan atom called the nucleus. Nearly all\nthe mass of an atom r esides in the\nnucleus.\n(ii)The electr ons r evolve ar ound the\nnucleus in circular paths.\n(iii) The size of the nucleus is very small\nas compar ed to the size of the atom.\nDrawbacks of Rutherford’s model of\nthe atom\nThe revolution of the electron in a circular orbit\nis not expected to be stable. Any particle in a\ncircular orbit would undergo acceleration.\nDuring acceleration, charged particles would\nradiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron\nwould lose energy and finally fall into the\nnucleus. If this were so, the atom should be\nhighly unstable and hence matter would not\nexist in the for m that we know. W e know that\natoms are quite stable.E. Rutherford (1871–1937)\nwas bor n at Spring Gr ove\non 30 August 1871. He was\nknown as the ‘Father’ of\nnuclear physics.  He is\nfamous for his work on\nradioactivity and the\ndiscovery of the nucleus of an atom with\nthe gold foil experiment. He got the Nobel\nprize in chemistry in 1908.\nLet us think of an activity in an open field\nto understand the implications  of this\nexperiment.

Chadwick discover ed another sub-\natomic particle which had no char ge and a\nmass nearly equal to that of a pr oton. It was\neventually named as neutr on. Neutr ons ar e\npresent in the nucleus of all atoms, except\nhydr ogen. In general, a neutr on is\nrepresented as ‘n’.

Among Pr ofessor\nBohr’s numer ous writings, thr ee appearing\nas books ar e:\n(i) The Theory of Spectra and Atomic\nConstitution, (ii) Atomic Theory and,\n(iii) The Description of Natur e.\nThese orbits or shells are called energy\nlevels.

Of these inert elements, the\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTRUCTURE  OF THE ATOM 43Table 4.1: Composition of Atoms of the First Eighteen Elements\nwith Electron Distribution in Various Shells\nhelium atom has two electrons in its outermost\nshell and all other elements have atoms with\neight electrons in the outermost shell.\nThe combining capacity of the atoms of\nelements, that is, their tendency to react and\nform molecules with atoms of the same or\ndifferent elements, was thus explained as an\nattempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell.\nAn outermost-shell, which had eight electrons\nwas said to possess an octet. Atoms would\nthus react, so as to achieve an octet in the\noutermost shell. This was done by sharing,\ngaining or losing electrons. The number of\nelectrons gained, lost or shared so as to make\nthe octet of electrons in the outermost shell,\ngives us directly the combining capacity of theelement, that is, the valency discussed in the\nprevious chapter . For example, hydr ogen/\nlithium/sodium atoms contain one electron\neach in their outermost shell, therefore each\none of them can lose one electron. So, they are\nsaid to have valency of one. Can you tell, what\nis valency of magnesium and aluminium? It\nis two and three, respectively, because\nmagnesium has two electrons in its outermost\nshell and aluminium has thr ee electr ons in\nits outer most shell.\nIf the number of electr ons in the\nouter most shell of an atom is close to its full\ncapacity, then valency is deter mined in a\ndifferent way. For example, the fluorine atom\nhas 7 electrons in the outermost shell, and its\nvalency could be 7.

What is the valency of oxygen that\nyou get from this calculation?\nTherefore, an atom of each element has a\ndefinite combining capacity, called its valency.\nValency of the first eighteen elements is given\nin the last column of T able 4.1.\nuestion\n1.How will you find the valency\nof chlorine, sulphur and\nmagnesium?\n4.5Atomic Number and Mass\nNumber\n4.5.1 ATOMIC  NUMBER\nWe know that pr otons ar e present in the\nnucleus of an atom. It is the number of\nprotons of an atom, which deter mines its\natomic number . It is denoted by ‘Z’. All atoms\nof an element have the same atomic number ,\nZ. In fact, elements ar e defined by the number\nof protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1,\nbecause in hydr ogen atom, only one proton\nis pr esent in the nucleus. Similarly, for\ncarbon, Z = 6. Ther efore, the atomic number\nis defined as the total number of pr otons\npresent in the nucleus of an atom.\n4.5.2 MASS\n NUMBER\nAfter studying the pr operties of the sub-\natomic particles of an atom, we can conclude\nthat mass of an atom is practically due to\nprotons and neutr ons alone. These ar e\npresent in the nucleus of an atom. Hence\nprotons and neutr ons ar e also called\nnucleons. Ther efore, the mass of an atom\nresides in its nucleus. For example, mass of\ncarbon is 12 u because it has 6 pr otons and6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the\nmass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons+14\nneutrons). The mass number is defined as the\nsum of the total number of protons and\nneutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. It\nis denoted by ‘A’. In the notation for an atom,\nthe atomic number , mass number and symbol\nof the element are to be written as:\nMass Number\nQSymbol of\nelement\nAtomic Number\nFor example, nitrogen is written as 14\n7N.\nuestions\n1.If number of electrons in an atom\nis 8 and number of pr otons is also\n8, then (i) what is the atomic\nnumber of the atom? and (ii) what\nis the char ge on the atom?\n2.With the help of T able 4.1, find\nout the mass number of oxygen\nand sulphur atom.\n4.6Isotopes\nIn natur e, a number of atoms of some\nelements have been identified, which have the\nsame atomic number but dif ferent mass\nnumbers. For example, take the case of\nhydrogen atom, it has thr ee atomic species,\nnamely pr otium (1\n1H), deuterium (2\n1H or D)\nand tritium (3\n1H or T). The atomic number of\neach one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2\nand 3, r espectively. Other such examples ar e\n(i) carbon, 12\n6C and 14\n6C, (ii) chlorine,  35\n17Cl\nand  37\n17Cl, etc.\nOn the basis of these examples, isotopes\nare defined as the atoms of the same element,\nhaving the same atomic number but dif ferent\nmass numbers. Ther efore, we can say that\nthere are three isotopes of hydrogen atom,\nnamely protium, deuterium and tritium.QXA\nZ\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTRUCTURE  OF THE ATOM 45QMany elements consist of a mixture of\nisotopes. Each isotope of an element is a pure\nsubstance. The chemical pr operties of\nisotopes ar e similar but their physical\nproperties ar e different.\nChlorine occurs in natur e in two isotopic\nforms, with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio\nof 3:1. Obviously, the question arises: what\nshould we take as the mass of chlorine atom?\nLet us find out.\nThe average atomic mass of chlorine atom,\non the basis of above data, will be\n3575\n1003725\n100× + ×\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n+ = =105\n437\n4142\n435 5 . u\nThe mass of an atom of any natural element\nis taken as the average mass of all the naturally\noccuring atoms of that element. If an element\nhas no isotopes, then the mass of its atom\nwould be the same as the sum of protons and\nneutrons in it. But if an element occurs in\nisotopic forms, then we have to know the\npercentage of each isotopic form and then the\naverage mass is calculated.\nThis does not mean that any one atom of\nchlorine has a fractional mass of 35.5 u. It\nmeans that if you take a certain amount of\nchlorine, it will contain both isotopes of\nchlorine and the average mass is 35.5 u.Applications\nSince the chemical properties of all the\nisotopes of an element ar e the same,\nnormally we ar e not concer ned about\ntaking a mixture.

Cork is  a substance\nwhich comes fr om the bark of a tr\nee. This\nwas in the year 1665 when Hooke made this\nchance observation thr ough a self-designed\nmicroscope. Robert Hooke called these boxes\ncells. Cell is a Latin word for ‘a little r oom’.\nThis may seem to be a very small and\ninsignificant incident but it is very important\nin the history of science. This was the very first\ntime that someone had observed that living\nthings appear to consist of separate units. The\nuse of the word ‘cell’ to describe these units is\nbeing used till this day in biology.\nLet us find out about cells.\n5.1What are Living Organisms\nMade Up of?\nActivity ______________ 5.1\n•Let us take a small piece fr om an onion\nbulb.

This layer can be\nput immediately in a watch-glass\ncontaining water . This will pr event the\npeel fr om getting folded or getting dry.\nWhat do we do with this peel?\n•Let us take a glass slide, put a dr op of\nwater on it and transfer a small piece\nof the peel fr om the watch glass to the\nslide. Make sur e that the peel is\nperfectly flat on the slide. A thin camel\nhair paintbrush might be necessary to\nhelp transfer the peel. Now we put a\ndrop of safranin solution on this piece\nfollowed by a cover slip. Take care toavoid air bubbles while putting the\ncover slip with the help of a mounting\nneedle.

W e find fr om this activity that\nonion bulbs of dif ferent sizes have similar\nsmall structures visible under a micr oscope.\nThe cells of the onion peel will all look the\nsame, r egardless of the size of the onion they\ncame from.\nThese small structures that we see ar e\nthe basic building units of the onion bulb.\nThese structur es ar e called cells. Not only\nonions, but all or ganisms that we observe\naround ar e made up of cells. However , ther e\nare also single cells that live on their own.\nCells wer e first discover ed by\nRobert Hooke  in 1665. He observed\nthe cells in a cork slice with the help\nof a primitive micr oscope.\nLeeuwenhoek (1674), with the\nimproved micr oscope, discover ed the\nfree living cells in pond water for the\nfirst time.  It was Robert Br own in\n1831 who discovered the nucleus in\nthe cell.   Purkinje in 1839 coined the\nterm ‘pr otoplasm’ for the fluid\nsubstance of the cell. The cell theory,\nthat all the plants and animals are\ncomposed of cells and that the cell is\nthe basic unit of life, was pr esented\nby two biologists, Schleiden (1838)\nand  Schwan n (1839). The cell theory\nwas further expanded by V irchow\n(1855) by suggesting  that all cells\narise  fr om pr e-existing cells.  W ith the\ndiscovery of the electr on micr oscope\nin 1940, it was possible to observe and\nunderstand the complex structur e of\nthe cell and its various or ganelles.\nThe invention of magnifying lenses led to\nthe discovery of the micr oscopic world. It is\nnow known that a single cell may constitute\na whole or ganism as in Amoeba,\nNerve Cell\nFat cell\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 51The shape and size of cells are related to\nthe specific function they per form. Some cells\nlike Amoeba\n have changing shapes. In some\ncases the cell shape could be mor e or less\nfixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell;\nfor example, nerve cells have a typical shape.\nEach living cell has the capacity to\nperform certain basic functions that ar e\ncharacteristic of all living for ms. How does\na living cell per form these basic functions?\nWe know that ther e is a division of labour in\nmulticellular or ganisms such as human\nbeings. This means that dif ferent parts of\nthe human body per form dif ferent functions.\nThe human body has a heart to pump blood,\na stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly,\ndivision of labour is also seen within a single\ncell. In fact, each such cell has got certain\nspecific components within it known as cell\norganelles. Each kind of cell or ganelle\nperforms a special function, such as making\nnew material in the cell, clearing up the\nwaste material fr om the cell and so on. A\ncell is able to live and per form all its\nfunctions because of these or ganelles. These\norganelles together constitute the basic unit\ncalled the cell. It is inter esting that all cells\nare found to have the same or ganelles, no\nmatter what their function is or what\norganism they ar e found in.\nuestions\n1.Who discovered cells, and how?\n2.Why is the cell called the\nstructural and functional unit of\nlife?\n5.2What is a Cell Made Up of?\nWhat is the Structural\nOrganisation of a Cell?\nWe saw above that the cell has special\ncomponents called or ganelles. How is a cell\norganised?\nIf we study a cell under a microscope, we\nwould come across thr ee featur es in almostevery cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and\ncytoplasm. All activities inside the cell and\ninteractions of the cell with its envir onment\nare possible due to these featur es. Let us see\nhow.\n5.2.1 PLASMA  MEMBRANE  OR CELL\nMEMBRANE\nThis is the outer most covering of the cell that\nseparates the contents of the cell fr om its\nexternal envir onment. The plasma membrane\nallows or per mits the entry and exit of some\nmaterials in and out of the cell. It also\nprevents movement of some other materials.\nThe cell membrane, ther efore, is called a\nselectively per meable membrane.\nHow does the movement of substances\ntake place into the cell? How do substances\nmove out of the cell?\nSome substances like carbon dioxide or\noxygen can move acr oss the cell membrane\nby a pr ocess called dif fusion. W e have studied\nthe pr ocess of dif fusion in earlier chapters.\nWe saw that there is spontaneous movement\nof a substance fr om a r egion of high\nconcentration to a r egion wher e its\nconcentration is low.\nSomething similar to this happens in cells\nwhen, for example, some substance like CO2\n(which is cellular waste and r equir es to be\nexcreted out by the cell) accumulates in high\nconcentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s\nexter nal envir onment, the concentration of\nCO2 is low as compar ed to that inside the\ncell. As soon as ther e is a dif ference of\nconcentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell,\nCO2 moves out of the cell, fr om a r egion of\nhigh concentration, to a r egion of low\nconcentration outside the cell by the pr ocess\nof dif fusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by\nthe pr ocess of dif fusion when the level or\nconcentration of O2 inside the cell decreases.\nThus, dif fusion plays an important r ole in\ngaseous exchange between the cells as well\nas the cell and its exter nal envir onment.\nWater also obeys the law of dif fusion. The\nmovement of water molecules through such a\nselectively permeable membrane is called osmosis.Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 52 52525252The movement of water across the plasma\nmembrane is also affected by the\namount of substance dissolved in water. Thus,\nosmosis is the net diffusion of water across a\nselectively permeable membrane toward a\nhigher solute concentration .\nWhat will happen if we put an animal cell\nor a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt\nin water?\nOne of the following thr ee things could\nhappen:\n1.If the medium surrounding the cell has\na higher water concentration than the\ncell, meaning that the outside solution\nis very dilute, the cell will gain water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypotonic solution.\nWater molecules are free to pass\nacross the cell membrane in both\ndirections, but more water will come\ninto the cell than will leave. The net\n(overall) result is that water enters the\ncell. The cell is likely to swell up.\n2.If the medium has exactly the same\nwater concentration as the cell, there\nwill be no net movement of water across\nthe cell membrane. Such a solution is\nknown as an isotonic solution.\nWater crosses the cell membrane in\nboth directions, but the amount going\nin is the same as the amount going out,\nso there is no overall movement of\nwater. The cell will stay the same size.\n3.If the medium has a lower\nconcentration of water than the cell,\nmeaning that it is a very concentrated\nsolution, the cell will lose water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypertonic solution.\nAgain, water cr osses the cell\nmembrane in both dir ections, but this\ntime mor e water leaves the cell than\nenters it. Ther efore the cell will shrink.\nThus, osmosis is a special case of dif fusion\nthrough a selectively permeable membrane.\nNow let us try out the following activity:Activity ______________ 5.3\n(a)Remove the shell of an egg by\ndissolving it in dilute hydrochloric\nacid. The shell is mostly calcium\ncarbonate. A thin outer skin now\nencloses the egg. Put the egg in pure\nwater and observe after 5 minutes.\nWhat do we observe?\nThe egg swells because water passes\ninto it by osmosis.\n(b)Place a similar de-shelled egg in a\nconcentrated salt solution and observe\nfor 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why?\nWater passes out of the egg solution\ninto the salt solution because the salt\nsolution is mor e concentrated.\nWe can also try a similar activity with dried\nraisins or apricots.\nActivity ______________ 5.4\n•Put dried raisins or apricots in plain\nwater and leave them for some time.\nThen place them into a concentrated\nsolution of sugar or salt. Y ou will\nobserve the following:\n(a)Each gains water and swells\nwhen placed in water .\n(b)However , when placed in the\nconcentrated solution it loses\nwater , and consequently shrinks.\nUnicellular freshwater organisms and\nmost plant cells tend to gain water thr ough\nosmosis. Absorption of water by plant r oots\nis also an example of osmosis.\nThus, dif fusion is important in exhange\nof gases and water in the life of a cell. In\nadditions to this, the cell also obtains\nnutrition fr om its envir onment. Dif ferent\nmolecules move in and out of the cell\nthrough a type of transport r equiring use\nof ener gy.\nThe plasma membrane is flexible and is\nmade up of or ganic molecules called lipids\nand pr oteins. However , we can observe the\nstructur e of the plasma membrane only\nthrough an electr\non micr oscope.\nThe flexibility of the cell membrane also\nenables the cell to engulf in food and other\nmaterial from its external environment. Such\nprocesses are known as endocytosis. Amoeba\nacquires its food through such processes.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 53Activity ______________ 5.5\n•Find out about electron microscopes\nfrom resour ces in the school library or\nthrough the inter net. Discuss it with\nyour teacher .\nuestions\n1.How do substances like CO2 and\nwater move in and out of the cell?\nDiscuss.\n2.Why is the plasma membrane\ncalled a selectively per meable\nmembrane?\n5.2.2 CELL WALL\nPlant cells, in addition to the plasma\nmembrane, have another rigid outer covering\ncalled the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside\nthe plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is\nmainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a\ncomplex substance and provides structural\nstrength to plants.\nWhen a living plant cell loses water\nthrough osmosis ther e is shrinkage or\ncontraction of the contents of the cell away\nfrom the cell wall. This phenomenon is known\nas plasmolysis. W e can observe this\nphenomenon by per forming the following\nactivity:\nActivity ______________ 5.6\n•Mount the peel of a Rhoeo leaf in water\non a slide and examine cells under\nthe high power of a microscope. Note\nthe small green granules, called\nchlor oplasts. They contain a gr een\nsubstance called chlor ophyll. Put a\nstrong solution of sugar or salt on the\nmounted leaf on the slide. W ait for a\nminute and observe under a\nmicroscope. What do we see?\n•Now place some Rhoeo leaves in boiling\nwater for a few minutes. This kills the\ncells. Then mount one leaf on a slide\nand observe it under a microscope. Put\na strong solution of sugar or salt on\nthe mounted leaf on the slide. Wait for\na minute and observe it again. What\ndo we find? Did plasmolysis occur now?What do we infer from this activity? It\nappears that only living cells, and not dead\ncells, are able to absorb water by osmosis.\nCell walls per mit the cells of plants, fungi\nand bacteria to withstand very dilute\n(hypotonic) exter nal media without bursting.\nIn such media the cells tend to take up water\nby osmosis. The cell swells, building up\npressur e against the cell wall. The wall exerts\nan equal pr essur e against the swollen cell.\nBecause of their walls, such cells can\nwithstand much gr eater changes in the\nsurrounding medium than animal cells.\n5.2.3 NUCLEUS\nRemember the temporary mount of onion peel\nwe pr epared? W e had put iodine solution on\nthe peel. Why? What would we see if we tried\nobserving the peel without putting the iodine\nsolution? T ry it and see what the dif ference\nis. Further , when we put iodine solution on\nthe peel, did each cell get evenly colour ed?\nAccording to their chemical composition\ndifferent r egions of cells get colour ed\ndifferentially. Some r egions appear darker\nthan other r egions. Apart fr om iodine solution\nwe could also use safranin solution or\nmethylene blue solution to stain the cells.\nWe have observed cells fr om an onion; let\nus now observe cells fr om our own body.\nActivity ______________ 5.7\n•Let us take a glass slide with a dr op of\nwater on it. Using an ice-cr eam spoon\ngently scrape the inside sur face of the\ncheek. Does any material get stuck on\nthe spoon? W ith the help of a needle\nwe can transfer this material and\nspread it evenly on the glass slide kept\nready for this. T o colour the material\nwe can put a dr op of methylene blue\nsolution on it. Now the material is r eady\nfor observation under micr oscope. Do\nnot forget to put a cover-slip on it!\n•What do we observe? What is the\nshape of the cells we see? Draw it on\nthe observation sheet.Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 54•Was ther e a darkly colour ed, spherical\nor oval, dot-like structure near the\ncentre of each cell? This structure is\ncalled nucleus. W ere ther e similar\nstructur es in onion peel cells?\nThe nucleus has a double layer ed covering\ncalled nuclear membrane. The nuclear\nmembrane has por es which allow the transfer\nof material fr om inside the nucleus to its\noutside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we\nwill talk about in section 5.2.4).\nThe nucleus contains chr omosomes,\nwhich ar e visible as r od-shaped structur\nes\nonly when the cell is about to divide.\nChromosomes contain infor mation for\ninheritance of characters from parents to next\ngeneration in the for m of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. Chr omosomes ar e\ncomposed of DNA and pr otein. DNA molecules\ncontain the infor mation necessary for\nconstructing and or ganising cells. Functional\nsegments of DNA are called genes. In a cell\nwhich is not dividing, this DNA is pr esent as\npart of chr omatin material. Chromatin\nmaterial is visible as entangled mass of thr ead\nlike structur es. Whenever the cell is about to\ndivide, the chr omatin material gets or ganised\ninto chr omosomes.\nThe nucleus plays a central r ole in cellular\nreproduction, the pr ocess by which a single\ncell divides and for ms two new cells. It also\nplays a crucial part, along with the\nenvir onment, in deter mining the way the cell\nwill develop and what for m it will exhibit at\nmaturity, by dir ecting the chemical activities\nof the cell.\nIn some or ganisms like bacteria, the\nnuclear r egion of the cell may be poorly\ndefined due to the absence of a nuclear\nmembrane. Such an undefined nuclear r egion\ncontaining only nucleic acids is called a\nnucleoid. Such or ganisms, whose cells lack\na nuclear membrane, ar e called prokaryotes\n(Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon\n= nucleus). Or ganisms with cells having a\nnuclear membrane are called eukaryotes.\nProkaryotic cells (see Fig. 5.4) also lack\nmost of the other cytoplasmic organellespresent in eukaryotic cells. Many of the\nfunctions of such organelles are also\nperformed by poorly or ganised parts of the\ncytoplasm (see section 5.2.4). The chlor ophyll\nin photosynthetic pr okaryotic bacteria is\nassociated with membranous vesicles (bag\nlike structur es) but not with plastids as in\neukaryotic cells (see section 5.2.5).\nRibosomesPlasma\nmembrane\nCell wall\nNucleoid\nFig. 5.4:  Prokaryotic cell\n5.2.4 CYTOPLASM\nWhen we look at the temporary mounts of\nonion peel as well as human cheek cells, we\ncan see a lar ge region of each cell enclosed\nby the cell membrane. This r egion takes up\nvery little stain. It is called the cytoplasm.\nThe cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the\nplasma membrane. It also contains many\nspecialised cell or ganelles. Each of these\norganelles per forms a specific function for the\ncell.\nCell or ganelles ar e enclosed by\nmembranes. In pr okaryotes, beside the\nabsence of a defined nuclear r egion, the\nmembrane-bound cell or ganelles ar e also\nabsent. On the other hand, the eukaryotic\ncells have nuclear membrane as well as\nmembrane-enclosed or\nganelles.\nThe significance of membranes can be\nillustrated with the example of viruses.\nViruses lack any membranes and hence do\nnot show characteristics of life until they enter\na living body and use its cell machinery to\nmultiply.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 55uestion\n1.Fill in the gaps in the following\ntable illustrating dif ferences\nbetween pr okaryotic and\neukaryotic cells.\nProkaryotic Cell Eukaryotic Cell\n1.Size : generally 1.Size: generally\nsmall ( 1-10 µm) large ( 5-100 µm)\n1 µm = 10–6 m\n2.Nuclear r egion: 2.Nuclear r egion:\n_______________ well defined  and\n_______________ surrounded by a\nand known as__ nuclear membrane\n3.Chromosome: 3.More than one\nsingle chromosome\n4.Membrane-bound 4._______________\ncell or ganelles _______________\nabsent _______________\n5.2.5 CELL ORGANELLES\nEvery cell has a membrane ar ound it to keep\nits own contents separate fr om the exter nal\nenvir onment. Lar ge and complex cells,\nincluding cells from multicellular or ganisms,\nneed a lot of chemical activities to support\ntheir complicated structur e and function. T o\nkeep these activities of dif ferent kinds\nseparate fr om each other , these cells use\nmembrane-bound little structures (or\n‘organelles’) within themselves. This is one of\nthe featur es of the eukaryotic cells that\ndistinguish them fr om pr okaryotic cells. Some\nof these or ganelles ar e visible only with an\nelectr on microscope.\nWe have talked about the nucleus in a\nprevious section. Some important examples\nof cell or ganelles which we will discuss now\nare: endoplasmic r eticulum, Golgi apparatus,\nlysosomes, mitochondria and plastids. They\nare important because they carry out some\nvery crucial functions in cells.5.2.5 ( i) ENDOPLASMIC  RETICULUM  (ER)\nThe endoplasmic r eticulum (ER) is a lar ge\nnetwork of membrane-bound tubes and\nsheets. It looks like long tubules or r ound or\noblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is\nsimilar in structur e to the plasma membrane.\nThere are two types of ER– r ough endoplasmic\nreticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic\nreticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a\nmicroscope because it has particles called\nribosomes attached to its sur face. The\nribosomes, which ar e present in all active\ncells, ar e the sites of protein manufactur e.\nThe manufactur ed pr oteins ar e then sent to\nvarious places in the cell depending on need,\nusing the ER. The SER helps in the\nmanufactur e of fat molecules, or lipids,\nimportant for cell function. Some of these\nproteins and lipids help in building the cell\nmembrane. This pr ocess is known as\nmembrane biogenesis. Some other pr oteins\nand lipids function as enzymes and\nhormones. Although the ER varies greatly in\nappearance in different cells, it always forms a\nnetwork system.Q\nFig. 5.5:  Animal cell\nThus, one function of the ER is to serve as\nchannels for the transport of materials\n(especially pr\noteins) between various r egions\nof the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm\nand the nucleus.

At\nthat time most of his\ninvestigations were\nconcerned with the nervous system, In 1872\nhe accepted the post of Chief Medical Officer\nat the Hospital for the Chronically Sick at\nAbbiategrasso.  He first started his\ninvestigations into the nervous system in a\nlittle kitchen of this hospital, which he had\nconverted into a laboratory. However , the\nwork of greatest importance, which Golgi\ncarried out was a revolutionary method of\nstaining individual nerve and cell structures.\nThis method is referred to as the ‘black\nreaction’. This method uses a weak solution\nof silver nitrate and is particularly valuable\nin tracing the processes and most delicate\nramifications of cells.  All through his life,\nhe continued to work on these lines,\nmodifying and improving this technique.\nGolgi received the highest honours and\nawards in recognition of his work. He shared\nthe Nobel prize in 1906 with Santiago\nRamony  Cajal for their work on the structure\nof the nervous system.\n5.2.5 ( iii) LYSOSOMES\nStructurally, lysosomes are membrane-bound\nsacs filled with digestive enzymes. These\nenzymes ar e made by RER. L ysosomes ar\ne a\nkind of waste disposal system of the cell. These\nhelp to keep the cell clean by digesting any\nforeign material as well as worn-out cell\norganelles. Foreign materials entering the cell,\nsuch as bacteria or food, as well as old\norganelles end up in the lysosomes, which\nbreak complex substances into simpler\nsubstances. L ysosomes are able to do this\nbecause they contain powerful digestive\nenzymes capable of breaking down all organic\nmaterial. During the disturbance in cellular\nmetabolism,  for example, when the cell getsFig. 5.6:  Plant cell\nfor some of the biochemical activities of the\ncell. In the liver cells of the group of animals\ncalled vertebrates (see Chapter 7), SER plays\na crucial role in detoxifying many poisons\nand drugs.\n5.2.5 ( ii) GOLGI APPARATUS\nThe Golgi apparatus, first described by\nCamillo Golgi, consists of a system of\nmembrane-bound vesicles (flattened sacs)\narranged approximately parallel to each other\nin stacks called cisterns. These membranes\noften have connections with the membranes\nof ER and therefore constitute another portion\nof a complex cellular membrane system.\nThe material synthesised near the ER is\npackaged and dispatched to various tar gets\ninside and outside the cell thr ough the Golgi\napparatus. Its functions include the storage,\nmodification and packaging of pr oducts in\nvesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may\nbe made from simple sugars in the Golgi\napparatus. The Golgi apparatus is also\ninvolved in the formation of lysosomes [see\n5.2.5 (iii)].\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL  UNIT OF LIFE 57 57575757damaged, lysosomes may burst and the\nenzymes digest their own cell. Therefore,\nlysosomes are also known as the ‘suicide bags’\nof a cell.\n5.2.5 ( iv) MITOCHONDRIA\nMitochondria are known as the powerhouses\nof the cell. Mitochondria have two membrane\ncoverings. The outer membrane is porous\nwhile the inner membrane is deeply folded.\nThese folds increase surface area for ATP-\ngenerating chemical reactions. The energy\nrequired for various chemical activities needed\nfor life is released by mitochondria in the form\nof ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules.\nATP is known as the energy currency of the\ncell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for\nmaking new chemical compounds and for\nmechanical work.\nMitochondria are strange organelles in the\nsense that they have their own DNA and\nribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able\nto make some of their own proteins.\n5.2.5 ( V) PLASTIDS\nPlastids are present only in plant cells. There\nare two types of plastids – chromoplasts\n(coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or\ncolourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing\nthe pigment chlorophyll are known as\nchloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for\nphotosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also\ncontain various yellow or orange pigments in\naddition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are\nprimarily organelles in which materials such\nas starch, oils and protein granules are stored.\nThe internal organisation of the Ch loroplast\nconsists of numerous membrane layers\nembedded in a material called the stroma. These\nare similar to mitochondria in external\nstructure. Like the mitochondria, plastids also\nhave their own DNA and ribosomes.\n5.2.5 ( vi) VACUOLES\nVacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid\ncontents. V acuoles are small sized in animal\ncells while plant cells have very large vacuoles .\nThe central vacuole of some plant cells may\noccupy 50-90% of the cell volume.In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap\nand provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell.\nMany substances of importance in the life of\nthe plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These\ninclude amino acids, sugars, various organic\nacids and some proteins. In single-celled\norganisms like Amoeba , the food vacuole\ncontains the food items that the Amoeba  has\nconsumed. In some unicellular organisms,\nspecialised vacuoles also play important roles\nin expelling excess water and some wastes\nfrom the cell.\nuestions\n1.Can you name the two organelles\nwe have studied that contain\ntheir own genetic material?\n2.If the organisation of a cell is\ndestroyed due to some physical\nor chemical influence, what will\nhappen?\n3.Why are lysosomes known as\nsuicide bags?\n4.Where are proteins synthesised\ninside the cell?\nEach cell thus acquires its structure and\nability to function because of the organisation\nof its membrane and organelles in specific\nways. The cell thus has a basic structural\norganisation. This helps the cells to perform\nfunctions like respiration, obtaining nutrition,\nand clearing of waste material, or forming\nnew proteins.\nThus, the cell is the fundamental structural\nunit of living organisms. It is also the basic\nfunctional unit of life.\nCell DivisionCell DivisionCell DivisionCell DivisionCell Division\nNew cells are formed in organisms in order to\ngrow, to replace old, dead and injured cells,\nand to form gametes required for\nreproduction. The process by which new cells\nare made is called cell division. There are two\nmain types of cell division: mitosis\nand meiosis.\nThe process of cell division by which most\nof the cells divide for growth is called mitosis.\nIn this process, each cell called mother cellQ\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 58 5858 5858\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n· The fundamental organisational unit of life is the cell.\n· Cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane composed of lipids\nand proteins.\n· The cell membrane is an active part of the cell.

{"class": "9", "subject": "science", "chapter": "Chapter 6: tissues", "content": "From the last chapter , we r ecall that all living\norganisms ar e made of cells. In unicellular\norganisms, a single cell per forms all basic\nfunctions. For example, in Amoeba , a single\ncell carries out movement, intake of food,\ngaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi-\ncellular organisms there are millions of cells.\nMost of these cells are specialised to carry out\nspecific functions. Each specialised function\nis taken up by a different group of cells. Since\nthese cells carry out only a particular function,\nthey do it very efficiently. In human beings,\nmuscle cells contract and relax to cause\nmovement, nerve cells carry messages, blood\nflows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and\nwaste material and so on. In plants, vascular\ntissues conduct food and water from one part\nof the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular\norganisms show division of labour . Cells\nspecialising in one function are often grouped\ntogether in the body. This means that a\nparticular function is carried out by a cluster\nof cells at a definite place in the body. This\ncluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and\ndesigned so as to give the highest possible\nefficiency of function. Blood, phloem and\nmuscle are all examples of tissues.\nA group of cells that are similar in structure\nand/or work together to achieve a particular\nfunction forms a tissue.\n6.1Are Plants and Animals Made\nof Same Types of Tissues?\nLet us compar e their structur e and functions.\nDo plants and animals have the same\nstructur e? Do they both per form similar\nfunctions?There are noticeable differences between\nthe two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they\ndon’t move. Since they have to be upright, they\nhave a large quantity of supportive tissue. The\nsupportive tissue generally has dead cells.\nAnimals on the other hand move around\nin sear ch of food, mates and shelter . They\nconsume more energy as compared to plants.\nMost of the tissues they contain are living.\nAnother difference between animals and\nplants is in the pattern of growth. The growth\nin plants is limited to certain regions, while this\nis not so in animals. There are some tissues in\nplants that divide throughout their life. These\ntissues are localised in certain regions. Based\non the dividing capacity of the tissues, various\nplant tissues can be classified as growing or\nmeristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell\ngrowth in animals is more uniform. So, there\nis no such demarcation of dividing and non-\ndividing regions in animals.\nThe structural organisation of organs and\norgan systems is far more specialised and\nlocalised in complex animals than even in very\ncomplex plants. This fundamental difference\nreflects the different modes of life pursued by\nthese two major groups of organisms,\nparticularly in their different feeding methods.\nAlso, they are differently adapted for a\nsedentary existence on one hand (plants) and\nactive locomotion on the other (animals),\ncontributing to this difference in organ system\ndesign.\nIt is with reference to these complex animal\nand plant bodies that we will now talk about\nthe concept of tissues in some detail.6\nT\nTT TTISSUES ISSUESISSUES ISSUESISSUESChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLateral meristemuestions\n1.What is a tissue?\n2.What is the utility of tissues in\nmulti-cellular organisms?\n6.2Plant Tissues\n6.2.1 MERISTEMATIC TISSUE•From the above observations, answer\nthe following questions:\n1.Which of the two onions has longer\nroots? Why?\n2.Do the roots continue growing\neven after we have removed their\ntips?\n3.Why would the tips stop growing\nin jar 2 after we cut them?\nThe growth of plants occurs only in certain\nspecific regions. This is because the dividing\ntissue, also known as meristematic tissue, is\nlocated only at these points. Depending on\nthe r egion where they are pr esent,\nmeristematic tissues ar e classified as apical,\nlateral and inter calary (Fig. 6.2). New cells\nproduced by meristem are initially like those\nof meristem itself, but as they grow and\nmature, their characteristics slowly change and\nthey become differentiated as components of\nother tissues.\nFig. 6.1:  Growth of r oots in onion bulbs\nActivity ______________ 6.1\n•Take two glass jars and fill them with\nwater .\n•Now, take two onion bulbs and place\none on each jar , as shown in\nFig. 6.1.\n•Observe the growth of roots in both\nthe bulbs for a few days.\n•Measure the length of roots on day 1,\n2 and 3.\n•On day 4, cut the r oot tips of the onion\nbulb in jar 2 by about 1 cm.

This pr ocess\nof taking up a per manent shape, size, and  a\nfunction is called differentiation. Differentiation\nleads to the development of various types of\npermanent tissues.3.Can we think of reasons why there\nwould be so many types of cells?\n•We can also try to cut sections of plant\nroots. W e can even try cutting sections\nof root and stem of dif ferent plants.\n6.2.2 ( i) SIMPLE\n PERMANENT  TISSUE\nA few layers of cells beneath the epidermis are\ngenerally simple permanent tissue.\nParenchyma is the most common simple\npermanent tissue. It consists of relatively\nunspecialised cells with thin cell walls. They\nare living cells. They are usually loosely\narranged, thus large spaces between cells\n(intercellular  spaces) are found in this tissue\n(Fig. 6.4  a). This tissue generally stores food.\nActivity ______________ 6.2\n•Take a plant stem and  with the help\nof your teacher cut into very thin slices\nor sections.\n•Now, stain the slices with safranin.\nPlace one neatly cut section on a slide,\nand put a dr op of glycerine.\n•Cover with a cover -slip and observe\nunder a micr oscope.

Compare it with Fig. 6.3.\n•Now, answer the following on the\nbasis of your observation:\n1.Are all cells similar in structure?\n2.How many types of cells can\nbe seen?In some situations, it contains chlorophyll and\nperforms photosynthesis, and then it is called\nchlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air\ncavities are present in parenchyma to help\nthem float. Such a parenchyma type is called\naerenchyma.\nThe flexibility in plants is due to another\npermanent tissue, collenchyma. It allows\nbending of various parts of a plant  like tendrils\nand stems of climbers without breaking. It\nalso pr ovides mechanical support. W e can find\nthis tissue in leaf stalks below the epidermis.\nThe cells of this tissue are living, elongated\nand irregularly thickened at the\ncorners. There is very little intercellular space\n(Fig. 6.4 b).\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTISSUES 63Fig. 6.4: Various types of simple tissues: (a) Par enchyma (b) Collenchyma (c) Scler enchyma (i) transverse section,\n(ii) longitudinal section.\nYet another type of per manent tissue is\nsclerenchyma. It is the tissue which makes the\nplant har d and stif f. We have seen the husk of\na coconut. It is made of sclerenchymatous\ntissue. The cells of this tissue are dead. They\nare long and narrow as the walls are thickened\ndue to lignin. Often these walls are so thick\nthat there is no internal space inside the cell\n(Fig. 6.4 c). This tissue is present in stems,\naround vascular bundles, in the veins of leaves\nand in the hard covering of seeds and nuts. It\nprovides strength to the plant parts.\nActivity ______________ 6.3\n•Take a freshly plucked leaf of Rhoeo.\n•Stretch and break it by applying\npressure.\n•While breaking it, keep it stretched\ngently so that some peel or skin\nprojects out from the cut.\n•Remove this peel and put it in a petri\ndish filled with water .\n•Add a few drops of safranin.\n•Wait for a couple of minutes and then\ntransfer it onto a slide.

In some\nplants living in very dry habitats, the epidermis\nmay be thicker since protection against water\nloss is critical. The entire surface of a plant has\nan outer covering epidermis.

This aids\nin protection against loss of water , mechanical\ninjury and invasion by parasitic fungi. Since\nit has a protective role to play, cells of\nepidermal  tissue form a continuous layer\nwithout intercellular spaces. Most epidermal\ncells are relatively flat. Often their outer and\nside walls are thicker than the inner wall.\nWe can observe small por es her e and\nthere in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores\nare called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are\nenclosed by two kidney-shaped cells\ncalled guard cells. They are necessary for\nexchanging gases with the atmosphere.\nTranspiration (loss of water in the for m of\nwater vapour) also takes place\nthrough stomata.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 64Recall which gas is required for\nphotosynthesis.\nFind out the role of transpiration in plants.\nEpidermal cells of the roots, whose function\nis water absorption, commonly bear long hair -\nlike parts that greatly increase the total\nabsorptive surface area.\nIn some plants like desert plants,\nepider mis has a thick waxy coating of cutin\n(chemical substance with waterpr oof quality)\non its outer sur face.

They\nalso have a substance called suberin in their\nwalls that makes them impervious to gases\nand water .is a distinctive feature of the complex plants,\none that has made possible their survival in\nthe terrestrial environment. In Fig. 6.3 showing\na section of stem, can you see different types\nof cells in the vascular bundle?\nXylem consists of tracheids, vessels, xylem\nparenchyma (Fig. 6.7 a,b,c) and xylem fibres.\nTracheids and vessels have thick walls, and\nmany ar e dead cells when matur\ne. Tracheids\nand vessels are tubular structures. This allows\nthem to transport water and minerals\nvertically. The parenchyma stores food. Xylem\nfibres are mainly supportive in function.\nPhloem is made up of five types of cells:\nsieve cells, sieve tubes, companion cells,\nphloem fibres and the phloem parenchyma\n[Fig. 6.7 (d)]. Sieve tubes are tubular cells with\nperforated walls. Phloem transports food from\nleaves to other parts of the plant. Except\nphloem fibres, other phloem cells are living cells.\n6.2.2 ( ii) COMPLEX  PERMANENT  TISSUE\nThe different types of tissues we have discussed\nuntil now are all made of one type of cells,\nwhich look like each other . Such tissues ar e\ncalled simple per manent tissue. Y et another\ntype of permanent tissue is complex tissue.\nComplex tissues are made of more than one\ntype of cells.

How do these body\nparts move? For this we have specialised cells\ncalled muscle cells (Fig. 6.8). The contraction\nand relaxation of these cells result\nin movement.Q\nFig. 6.8:  Location of muscle fibres\nSmooth muscle fibres\nSmooth muscle fibre\n(Cell)NucleusDuring breathing we inhale oxygen. Where\ndoes this oxygen go? It is absorbed in the lungs\nand then is transported to all the body cells\nthrough blood. Why would cells need oxygen?\nThe functions of mitochondria we studied\nearlier provide a clue to this question. Blood\nflows and carries various substances from one\npart of the body to the other . For example, it\ncarries oxygen and food to all cells. It also\ncollects wastes from all parts of the body and\ncarries them to the liver and kidney for\ndisposal.\nBlood and muscles are both examples of\ntissues found in our body. On the basis of  the\nfunctions they perform we can think of different\ntypes of animal tissues, such as epithelial\ntissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and\nnervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective\ntissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue.\n6.3.1 EPITHELIAL  TISSUE\nThe covering or protective tissues in the animal\nbody are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers\nmost organs and cavities within the body. It\nalso forms a barrier to keep different body\nsystems separate. The skin, the lining of the\nmouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli\nand kidney tubules are all made of epithelial\ntissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed\nand form a continuous sheet. They have only\na small amount of cementing material between\nthem and almost no intercellular spaces.\nObviously, anything entering or leaving the\nbody must cross at least one layer of\nepithelium. As a result, the permeability of the\ncells of various epithelia play an important role\nin regulating the exchange of materials\nbetween the body and the external\nenvironment and also between different parts\nof the body. Regardless of the type, all\nepithelium is usually separated from the\nunderlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous\nbasement membrane.\nDifferent epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing\nstructures that correlate with their unique\nfunctions. For example, in cells lining blood\nvessels or lung alveoli, where transportation\nof substances occurs through a selectively\npermeable surface, there is a simple flat kind\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 66Fig. 6.9: Different types of epithelial tissuesof skin). Simple squamous epithelial cells are\nextremely thin and flat and form a delicate\nlining. The oesophagus and the lining of the\nmouth are also covered with squamous\nepithelium. The skin, which protects the body,\nis also made of squamous epithelium. Skin\nepithelial cells are arranged in many layers to\nprevent wear and tear . Since they ar e arranged\nin a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called\nstratified squamous epithelium.\nWher e absorption and secr etion occur , as\nin the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial\ncells are present. This columnar (meaning\n‘pillar -like’) epithelium facilitates movement\nacross the epithelial barrier . In the r espiratory\ntract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has\ncilia, which ar e hair -like pr ojections on the\nouter surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can\nmove, and their movement pushes the mucus\nforward to clear it. This type of epithelium is\nthus ciliated columnar epithelium.\nCuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped\ncells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and\nducts of salivary glands, where it provides\nmechanical support. Epithelial cells often\nacquire additional specialisation as gland cells,\nwhich can secrete substances at the epithelial\nsurface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial\ntissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland\nis formed. This is glandular epithelium.\n6.3.2 CONNECTIVE  \nTISSUE\nBlood is a type of connective tissue. Why would\nit be called ‘connective’ tissue? A clue is\nprovided in the introduction of this chapter!\nNow, let us look at this type of tissue in some\nmore detail. The cells of connective tissue are\nloosely spaced and embedded in an\nintercellular matrix (Fig. 6.10). The matrix may\nbe jelly like, fluid, dense or rigid. The nature\nof matrix differs in concordance with the\nfunction of the particular connective tissue.\nActivity 6.4\nTake a drop of blood on a slide and\nobserve different cells present in it\nunder a microscope.of epithelium. This is called the simple\nsquamous epithelium (squama means scale\n(a) Squamous\n(b) Stratified squamous\n(c) Cuboidal\n(d) Columnar (Ciliated)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTISSUES 67Blood has a fluid (liquid) matrix called\nplasma, in which red blood corpuscles (RBCs),\nwhite blood corpuscles (WBCs) and platelets\nare suspended. The plasma contains proteins,\nsalts and hormones. Blood flows and\ntransports gases, digested food, hor mones\nand waste materials to different parts of\nthe body.\nBone is another example of a connective\ntissue. It forms the framework that supports\nthe body. It also anchors the muscles and\nsupports the main or gans of the body. It is a\nstrong and nonflexible tissue (what would be\nthe advantage of these pr operties for bone\nfunctions?). Bone cells ar e embedded in a\nhard matrix that is composed of calcium and\nphosphorus compounds.\nTwo bones can be connected to each other\nby another type of connective tissue called the\nligament. This tissue is very elastic. It has\nconsiderable str ength. Ligaments contain\nvery little matrix and connect bones with\nbones. Tendons connect muscles to bones and\nare another type of connective tissue. Tendons\nare fibrous tissue with great strength but\nlimited flexibility.\nAnother type of connective tissue,\ncartilage, has widely spaced cells. The solid\nmatrix is composed of pr\noteins and sugars.\nCartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints\nand is also present in the nose, ear , trachea\nand larynx. W e can fold the cartilage of the ears,\nbut we cannot bend the bones in our arms.\nThink of how  the two tissues are different!\nAreolar connective tissue is found between\nthe skin and muscles, ar ound blood vessels\nand nerves and in the bone marr ow. It fills\nthe space inside the or gans, supports inter nal\norgans and helps in r epair of tissues.\nWher e are fats stor ed in our body?

W e have specified the\nposition of the school with r espect to the\nrailway station. In this example, the railway\nstation is the r eference point.

W e shall first lear n to\ndescribe this by an example. Consider the\nmotion of an object moving along a straight\npath. The object starts its jour ney fr om O\nwhich is tr eated as its r eference point\n(Fig. 7.1). Let A, B and C represent the position\nof the object at different instants. At first, the\nobject moves through C and B and reaches A.\nThen it moves back along the same path and\nreaches C through B.\nare used to describe the overall motion of an\nobject and to locate its final position with\nreference to its initial position at a given time.\nActivity ______________ 7.3\n•Take a metre scale and a long rope.\n•Walk fr om one cor ner of a basket-ball\ncourt to its oppposite cor ner along its\nsides.\n•Measur e the distance cover ed by you\nand magnitude of the displacement.\n•What dif ference would you notice\nbetween the two in this case?\nActivity ______________ 7.4\n•Automobiles are fitted with a device\nthat shows the distance travelled. Such\na device is known as an odometer . A\ncar is driven fr om Bhubaneshwar to\nNew Delhi. The dif ference between the\nfinal r eading and the initial r eading of\nthe odometer is 1850 km.\n•Find the magnitude of the displacement\nbetween Bhubaneshwar and New Delhi\nby using the Road Map of India.The total path length covered by the object\nis OA + AC, that is 60 km + 35 km = 95 km.\nThis is the distance cover ed by the object. T o\ndescribe distance we need to specify only the\nnumerical value and not the dir ection of\nmotion. Ther e are certain quantities which\nare described by specifying only their\nnumerical values. The numerical value of a\nphysical quantity is its magnitude. Fr om this\nexample, can you find out the distance of the\nfinal position C of the object fr om the initial\nposition O? This dif ference will give you the\nnumerical value of the displacement of the\nobject fr om O to C thr ough A. The shortest\ndistance measur ed from the initial to the final\nposition of an object is known as\nthe displacement.\nCan the magnitude of the displacement be\nequal to the distance travelled by an object?\nConsider the example given in (Fig. 7.1). For\nmotion of the object from O to A,  the distance\ncovered is 60 km  and the magnitude of\ndisplacement is also 60 km. During its motion\nfrom O to A and back to B, the distance coveredFig. 7.1:  Positions of an object on a straight line path= 60 km + 25 km = 85 km while the magnitude\nof displacement = 35 km. Thus, the magnitude\nof displacement (35 km) is not equal to the path\nlength (85 km). Further , we will notice that the\nmagnitude of the displacement for a course of\nmotion may be zero but the corresponding\ndistance covered is not zero. If we consider the\nobject to travel back to O, the final position\nconcides with the initial position, and therefore,\nthe displacement is zer o. However , the distance\ncovered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km +\n60 km = 120 km.

As the object covers equal distances\nin equal intervals of time, it is said to be in\nunifor m motion. The time interval in this\nmotion should be small. In our day-to-day\nlife, we come acr oss motions wher e objects\ncover unequal distances in equal intervals\nof time, for example, when a car is moving\non a cr owded str eet or a person is jogging\nin a park. These ar e some instances of\nnon-unifor m motion.\nActivity ______________ 7.5\n•The data regarding the motion of two\ndifferent objects A and B ar e given in\nTable 7.1.\n•Examine them car efully and state\nwhether the motion of the objects is\nunifor m or non-unifor m.Q\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 7.2Table 7.1\nTime Distance Distance\ntravelled by\ntravelled by\nobject A in m object  B in m\n9:30 am 10 12\n9:45 am 20 19\n10:00 am 30 23\n10:15 am 40 35\n10:30 am 50 37\n10:45 am 60 41\n11:00 am 70 44\n7.2Measuring the Rate of Motion\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMOTION 75Look at the situations given in Fig. 7.2. If\nthe bowling speed is 143 km h–1 in Fig. 7.2(a)\nwhat does it mean? What do you understand\nfrom the signboard in Fig. 7.2(b)?\nDifferent objects may take dif ferent\namounts of time to cover a given distance.\nSome of them move fast and some move\nslowly.  The rate at which objects move can\nbe dif ferent. Also, dif fer\nent objects can move\nat the same rate. One of the ways of\nmeasuring the rate of motion of an object is\nto find out the distance travelled by the object\nin unit time. This quantity is r eferred to as\nspeed. The SI unit of speed is metr e per\nsecond. This is r epresented by the symbol\nm s–1 or m/s. The other units of speed include\ncentimetr e per second (cm s–1) and kilometr e\nper hour (km h–1). To specify the speed of an\nobject, we r equir e only its magnitude. The\nspeed of an object need not be constant. In\nmost cases, objects will be in non-uniform\nmotion. Ther efore, we describe the rate of\nmotion of such objects in ter ms of their\naverage speed. The average speed of an object\nis obtained by dividing the total distance\ntravelled by the total time taken. That is,\naverage speed = Total distance travelled\nTotal time taken\nIf an object travels a distance s in time t then\nits speed v is,\nv = s\nt(7.1)\nLet us understand this by an example. A\ncar travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its\naverage speed is 50 km h–1. The car might\nnot have travelled at 50 km h–1 all the time.\nSometimes it might have travelled faster and\nsometimes slower than this.\nExample 7.1  An object travels 16 m in 4 s\nand then another 16 m in 2 s. What is\nthe average speed of the object?\nSolution:\nTotal distance travelled by the object =\n16 m + 16 m = 32 m\nTotal time taken = 4 s + 2 s = 6 sAverage speed =  Total distance travelled\nTotal time taken\n= 32 m\n6 s= 5.33 m s–1\nTherefore, the average speed of the object\nis 5.33 m s–1.\n7.2.1 SPEED WITH DIRECTION\nThe rate of motion of an object can be mor e\ncompr ehensive if we specify its dir ection of\nmotion along with its speed. The quantity that\nspecifies both these aspects is called velocity.\nVelocity is the speed of an object moving in a\ndefinite dir ection. The velocity of an object\ncan be unifor m or variable. It can be changed\nby changing the object’s speed, dir ection of\nmotion or both. When an object is moving\nalong a straight line at a variable speed, we\ncan expr ess the magnitude of its rate of\nmotion in ter ms of average velocity. It is\ncalculated in the same way as we calculate\naverage speed.\nIn case the velocity of the object is\nchanging at a unifor m rate, then average\nvelocity is given by the arithmetic mean of\ninitial velocity and final velocity for a given\nperiod of time. That is,\naverage velocity = initialvelocity + finalvelocity\n2\nMathematically, v av  = u + v\n2(7.2)\nwhere vav is the average velocity, u is the initial\nvelocity and v is the final velocity of the object.\nSpeed and velocity have the same units,\nthat is, m s–1 or m/s.\nActivity ______________ 7.6\n•Measure the time it takes you to walk\nfrom your house to your bus stop or\nthe school.

In this case, the change in velocity\nof the object for any time interval is zero.\nHowever , in non-uniform motion, velocity\nvaries with time. I t has dif ferent values at\ndifferent instants and at dif ferent points of\nthe path.

That is,\nacceleration  =change in velocity\ntime taken\nIf the velocity of an object changes from\nan initial value u to the final value v in time\nt, the acceleration a is,\nv – u\na =\nt(7.3)\nThis kind of motion is known as\naccelerated motion. The acceleration is taken\nto be positive if it is in the direction of velocity\nand negative when it is opposite to the\ndirection of velocity . The SI unit of\nacceleration is m s–2 .\nIf an object travels in a straight line and\nits velocity increases or decreases by equal\namounts in equal intervals of time, then the\nacceleration of the object is said to be\nuniform. The motion of a fre ely falling body\nis an example of uniformly accelerated\nmotion. On the other hand, an object can\ntravel with non-uniform acceleration if its\nvelocity changes at a non-uniform rate.

For example, in the telecast of a\none-day cricket match, vertical bar graphs\nshow the run rate of a team in each over . As\nyou have studied in mathematics, a straight\nline graph helps in solving a linear equation\nhaving two variables.\nTo describe the motion of an object, we\ncan use line graphs. In this case, line graphs\nshow dependence of one physical quantity,\nsuch as distance or velocity, on another\nquantity, such as time.\n7.4.1 DISTANCE –TIME GRAPHS\nThe change in the position of an object with\ntime can be represented on the distance-time\ngraph adopting a convenient scale of choice.\nIn this graph, time is taken along the x–axis\nand distance is taken along the y-axis.\nDistance-time graphs can be employed under\nvarious conditions where objects move with\nuniform speed, non-uniform speed, remain\nat rest etc.\nFig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3:Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3:Fig. 7.3: Distance-time graph of an object moving\nwith unifor m speed\nWe know that when an object travels equal\ndistances in equal intervals of time, it moves\nwith uniform speed. This shows that thedistance travelled by the object is directly\nproportional to time taken. Thus, for uniform\nspeed, a graph of distance travelled against\ntime is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3.\nThe portion OB of the graph shows that the\ndistance is increasing at a uniform rate. N ote\nthat, you can also use the term uniform\nvelocity in place of uniform spe ed if you take\nthe magnitude of displacement equal to the\ndistance travelled by the object along the\ny-axis.\nWe can use the distance-time graph to\ndetermine the spe ed of an object. T o do so,\nconsider a small part AB of the distance-time\ngraph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel\nto the x- axis from point A and another line\nparallel to the y-axis from point B . These two\nlines me et each other at point C to form a\ntriangle ABC. Now, on the graph, A\nC denotes\nthe time interval ( t2 – t1) while BC corresponds\nto the distance ( s2 – s1). We can se e from the\ngraph that as the object moves from the point\nA to B, it covers a distance ( s2 – s1) in time\n(t2 – t1).

If the object\nmoves at uniform velocity, the height of its\nvelocity-time graph will not change with time\n(Fig. 7.5). It will be a straight line parallel to\nthe x-axis. Fig. 7.5 shows the velocity-time\ngraph for a car moving with uniform velocity\nof 40 km h–1.\nWe know that the pr oduct of velocity and\ntime give displacement of an object moving\nwith unifor m velocity. The ar\nea enclosed by\nvelocity-time graph and the time axis will be\nequal to the magnitude of the displacement.\nTo know the distance moved by the car\nbetween time  t1 and t2 using Fig. 7.5, draw\nperpendiculars fr om the points corr esponding\nto the time t1 and t2 on the graph. The velocity\nof 40 km h–1 is repr esented by the height AC\nor BD and the time ( t2 – t1) is represented by\nthe length AB.\nSo, the distance s moved by the car in\ntime ( t2 – t1) can be expr essed as\ns=AC × CD\n=[(40 km h–1) × (t2 – t1) h]\n=40 (t2– t1) km\n=area of the r ectangle ABDC (shaded\nin Fig. 7.5).\nWe can also study about unifor mly\naccelerated motion by plotting its velocity–\ntime graph.

Thus, for all unifor mly accelerated\nmotion, the velocity-time graph is a\nstraight line.\nFig. 7.6:  Velocity-time graph for a car moving with\nuniform accelerations.\nYou can also deter mine the distance\nmoved by the car fr om its velocity-time graph.\nThe ar\nea under the velocity-time graph gives\nthe distance (magnitude of displacement)\nmoved by the car in a given interval of time.\nIf the car would have been moving with\nunifor m velocity, the distance travelled by it\nwould be r epresented by the ar ea ABCD\nunder the graph (Fig. 7.6). Since the\nmagnitude of the velocity of the car is\nchanging due to acceleration, the distance s\ntravelled by the car will be given by the area\nABCDE under the velocity-time graph\n(Fig. 7.6).\nThat is,\ns=area ABCDE\n=area of the rectangle ABCD + area of\nthe triangle ADE\n=AB × BC +  1\n2(AD × DE)\nIn the case of non-unifor mly accelerated\nmotion, velocity-time graphs can have any\nshape.Fig. 7.7:  Velocity-time graphs of an object in non-\nunifor mly accelerated motion.\nFig. 7.7(a) shows a velocity-time graph that\nrepresents the motion of an object whose\nvelocity is decr easing with time while\nFig. 7.7 (b) shows the velocity-time graph\nrepresenting the non-unifor m variation of\nvelocity of the object with time.

For convenience, a\nset of three such equations are given below:\nv=u + at (7.5)\ns=ut + ½ at2(7.6)\n2 as = v2 – u2(7.7)\nwhere u is the initial velocity of the object which\nmoves with uniform acceleration a for time t,\nv is the final velocity, and s is the distance\ntravelled by the object in time t.

The change in\nthe velocity could be due to change in its\nmagnitude or the direction of the motion or\nboth. Can you think of an example when an\nobject does not change its magnitude of\nvelocity but only its direction of motion?straight parts AB, BC, CD and DA of the track.\nIn order to keep himself on track, he quickly\nchanges his speed at the corners. How many\ntimes will the athlete have to change his\ndirection of motion, while he completes one\nround? It is clear that to move in a rectangular\ntrack once, he has to change his direction of\nmotion four times.\nNow, suppose instead of a rectangular\ntrack, the athlete is running along a\nhexagonal shaped path ABCDEF , as shown\nin Fig. 7.8(b). In this situation, the athlete will\nhave to change his direction six times while\nhe  completes one round. What if the track\nwas not a hexagon but a regular octagon,\nwith eight equal sides as shown by\nABCDEFGH in Fig. 7.8(c)?  It is observed that\nas the number of sides of the track increases\nthe athelete has to take turns more and more\noften. What would happen to the shape of the\ntrack as we go on increasing the number of\nsides indefinitely? If you do this you will\nnotice that the shape of the track approaches\nthe shape of a circle and the length of each of\nthe sides will decrease to a point. If the athlete\nmoves with a velocity of constant magnitude\nalong the circular path, the only change in\nhis velocity is due to the change in the\ndirection of motion. The motion of the athlete\nmoving along a circular path is, therefore, an\nexample of an accelerated moti on.\nWe know  that the cir cumfer ence of a cir cle\nof radius r is given by  π2 r. If the athlete takes\nt seconds to go once around the circular path\nof radius r, the speed v is given by\nπ2 rv =\nt\n(7.8)\nWhen an object moves in a circular path\nwith uniform speed, its motion is called\nuniform circular motion.(a) Rectangular track (b) Hexagonal track\n(d) A cir cular track (c) Octagonal shaped track\nFig. 7.8: The motion of an athlete along closed tracks\nof different shapes.\nLet us consider an example of the motion\nof a body along a closed path.

Move\nthe stone to describe a circular path\nwith constant speed by holding the\nthread at the other end, as shown in\nFig. 7.9.If you carefully note, on being released\nthe stone moves along a straight line\ntangential to the circular path. This is\nbecause once the stone is released, it\ncontinues to move along the direction it has\nbeen moving at that instant. This shows that\nthe direction of motion changed at every point\nwhen the stone was moving along the circular\npath.\nWhen an athlete throws a hammer or a\ndiscus in a sports meet, he/she holds the\nhammer or the discus in his/her hand and\ngives it a circular motion by rotating his/\nher own body.

W e have not yet discover ed\nwhat causes the motion. Why does the speed\nof an object change with time? Do all motions\nrequir e a cause? If so, what is the natur e of\nthis cause? In this chapter we shall make an\nattempt to quench all such curiosities.\nFor many centuries, the pr oblem of\nmotion and its causes had puzzled scientists\nand philosophers. A ball on the gr ound, when\ngiven a small hit, does not move for ever. Such\nobservations suggest that r\nest is the “natural\nstate” of an object. This r emained the belief\nuntil Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton\ndeveloped an entir ely dif ferent appr oach to\nunderstand motion.In our everyday life we observe that some\neffort is r equir ed to put a stationary object\ninto motion or to stop a moving object. W e\nordinarily experience this as a muscular ef fort\nand say that we must push or hit or pull on\nan object to change its state of motion. The\nconcept of for ce is based on this push, hit or\npull. Let us now ponder about a ‘for ce’. What\nis it? In fact, no one has seen, tasted or felt a\nforce. However , we always see or feel the ef fect\nof a force. It can only be explained by\ndescribing what happens when a for ce is\napplied to an object. Pushing, hitting and\npulling of objects ar e all ways of bringing\nobjects in motion (Fig. 8.1). They move because\nwe make a force act on them.\nFrom your studies in earlier classes, you\nare also familiar with the fact that a for ce can\nbe used to change the magnitude of velocity\nof an object (that is, to make the object move\nfaster or slower) or to change its dir ection of\nmotion. W e also know that a for ce can change\nthe shape and size of objects (Fig. 8.2).\n(a) The tr olley moves along the\ndirection we push it.\n(c) The hockey stick hits the ball forwar d(b) The drawer is pulled.\nFig. 8.1:     Pushing, pulling, or hitting objects change\ntheir state of motion.(a)\n(b)\nFig. 8.2: (a) \nA spring expands on application of force;\n(b) A spherical rubber ball becomes oblong\n    as we apply force on it.8\nF FF FFORCE ORCEORCE ORCEORCE     AND ANDAND ANDAND L  L L  L LAWS AWSAWS AWSAWS     OF OFOF OFOF M  M M  M MOTION OTIONOTION OTIONOTIONChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 88box with a small force, the box does not move\nbecause of friction acting in a dir ection\nopposite to the push [Fig. 8.4(a)]. This friction\nforce arises between two sur faces in contact;\nin this case,\n between the bottom of the box\nand floor’s r ough sur face. It balances the\npushing force and therefore the box does not\nmove. In Fig. 8.4(b), the children push the box\nharder but the box still does not move. This is\nbecause the friction force still balances the\npushing force. If the children push the box\nharder still, the pushing force becomes bigger\nthan the friction force [Fig. 8.4(c)].\nThere is an unbalanced force. So the box\nstarts moving.\nWhat happens when we ride a bicycle?\nWhen we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins\nto slow down. This is again because of the\nfriction for ces acting opposite to the dir ection\nof motion. In or der to keep the bicycle moving,\nwe have to start pedalling again. It thus\nappears that an  object maintains its motion\nunder the continuous application of an\nunbalanced for ce. However , it is quite\nincorr ect. An object moves with a unifor m\nvelocity when the for ces (pushing force and\nfrictional for ce) acting on the object ar e\nbalanced and ther e is no net exter nal for ce\non it. If an unbalanced for ce is applied on\nthe object, ther e will be a change either in its\nspeed or in the direction of its motion. Thus,\nto accelerate the motion of an object, an\nunbalanced for ce is r equir ed. And the change\nin its speed (or in the dir ection of motion)\nwould continue as long as this unbalanced\nforce is applied. However , if this for ce is8.1Balanced and Unbalanced\nForces\nFig. 8.3 shows a wooden block on a horizontal\ntable. Two strings X and Y are tied to the two\nopposite faces of the block as shown. If we\napply a for ce by pulling the string X, the block\nbegins to move to the right. Similarly, if we\npull the string Y , the block moves to the left.\nBut, if the block is pulled fr om both the sides\nwith equal for ces, the block will not move.\nSuch for ces are called balanced for ces and\ndo not change the state of r est or of motion of\nan object. Now, let us consider a situation in\nwhich two opposite for ces of dif ferent\nmagnitudes pull the block. In this case, the\nblock would begin to move in the dir ection of\nthe gr eater for ce. Thus, the two for ces ar e\nnot balanced and the unbalanced for ce acts\nin the dir ection the block moves. This\nsuggests that an unbalanced force acting on\nan object brings it in motion.\nFig. 8.3: Two forces acting on a wooden block\nWhat happens when some children try to\npush a box on a rough floor?

He observed that when a marble\nrolls down an inclined plane, its velocity\nincreases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter , you\nwill learn that the marble falls under the\nunbalanced for\nce of gravity as it r olls down\nand attains a definite velocity by the time it\nreaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases\nwhen it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b).\nFig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal\nfrictionless plane inclined on both sides.\nGalileo ar gued that when the marble is\nreleased fr om left, it would r oll down the slope\nand go up on the opposite side to the same\nheight fr om which it was r eleased. If the\ninclinations of the planes on both sides ar e\nequal then the marble will climb the same\ndistance that it cover ed while rolling down. If\nthe angle of inclination of the right-side plane\nwere gradually decr eased, then the marble\nwould travel further distances till it r eaches\nthe original height. If the right-side plane wer e\nultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope\nis reduced to zer o), the marble would continue\nto travel for ever trying to r each the same\nheight that it was r eleased fr om. The\nunbalanced forces on the marble in this case\nare zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced\n(exter nal) for ce is r equir ed to change the\nmotion of the marble but no net for ce is\nneeded to sustain the unifor m motion of the\nmarble.  In practical situations it is dif ficult\nto achieve a zer o unbalanced for ce. This is\nbecause of the presence of the frictional for ce\nacting opposite to the dir ection of motion.\nThus, in practice the marble stops after\ntravelling some distance. The ef fect of the\nfrictional for ce may be minimised by using a\nsmooth marble and a smooth plane and\nproviding a lubricant on top of the planes.Fig. 8.5: (a) the downward motion; (b) the upward\nmotion of a marble on an inclined plane;\nand (c) on a double inclined plane.\nNewton further studied Galileo’s ideas on\nforce and motion and pr esented thr ee\nfundamental laws that gover n the motion of\nobjects. These thr ee laws ar e known as\nNewton’s laws of motion. The first law of\nmotion is stated as:\nAn object r emains in a state of r est or of\nunifor m motion in a straight line unless\ncompelled to change that state by an\napplied force.\nIn other words, all objects resist a change\nin their state of motion . In a qualitative way,\nthe tendency of undisturbed objects to stay\nat rest or to keep moving with the same\nvelocity is called inertia. This is why, the first\nlaw of motion is also known as the law\nof inertia.\nCertain experiences that we come across\nwhile travelling in a motor car can be\nexplained on the basis of the law of inertia.\nWe tend to r emain at rest with r espect to the\nseat until the driver applies a braking for ce\nto stop the motor car. With the application of\nbrakes, the car slows down but our body\ntends to continue in the same state of motion\nbecause of its inertia. A sudden application of\nbrakes may thus cause injury to us by impact\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 90or collision with the panels in front. Safety belts\nare worn to prevent such accidents. Safety belts\nexert a force on our body to make the forward\nmotion slower . An opposite experience is\nencountered when we are standing in a bus\nand the bus begins to move suddenly. Now\nwe tend to fall backwards. This is because the\nsudden start of the bus brings motion to the\nbus as well as to our feet in contact with the\nfloor of the bus. But the rest of our body\nopposes this motion because of its inertia.\nWhen a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a\nhigh speed, we tend to get thrown to one side.\nThis can again be explained on the basis of\nthe law of inertia. W e tend to continue in our\nstraight-line motion. When an unbalanced\nforce is applied by the engine to change the\ndirection of motion of the motor car, we slip to\none side of the seat due to the inertia of\nour body.\nThe fact that a body will remain at rest\nunless acted upon by an unbalanced for ce\ncan be illustrated through the\nfollowing activities:\nActivity ______________ 8.1\n•Make a pile of similar carom coins on\na table, as shown in Fig. 8.6.\n•Attempt  a sharp horizontal hit at the\nbottom of the pile using another car om\ncoin or the striker .

Once the lowest coin is\nremoved, the inertia of the other coins\nmakes them ‘fall’ vertically on the\ntable.Galileo Galilei was born\non 15 February 1564 in\nPisa, Italy. Galileo, right\nfrom his childhood, had\ninterest in mathematics\nand natural philosophy.\nBut his father\nVincenzo Galilei wanted\nhim to become a medical\ndoctor . Accor dingly,\nGalileo enr olled himself\nfor a medical degr ee at the\nUniversity of Pisa in 1581 which he never\ncompleted because of his r eal inter est in\nmathematics. In 1586, he wr ote his first\nscientific book ‘The Little Balance [La\nBalancitta ]’, in which he described\nArchimedes’ method of finding the relative\ndensities (or specific gravities) of substances\nusing a balance. In 1589, in his series of\nessays – De Motu , he pr esented his theories\nabout falling objects using an inclined plane\nto slow down the rate of descent.\nIn 1592, he was appointed pr ofessor of\nmathematics at the University of Padua in\nthe Republic of V enice. Her e he continued his\nobservations on the theory of motion and\nthrough his study of inclined planes and the\npendulum, for mulated the corr ect law for\nunifor mly accelerated objects that the\ndistance the object moves is pr oportional to\nthe squar\ne of the time taken.\nGalileo was also a r emarkable craftsman.\nHe developed a series of telescopes whose\noptical per formance was much better than\nthat of other telescopes available during those\ndays. Ar ound 1640, he designed the first\npendulum clock. In his book ‘Starry\nMessenger’ on his astr onomical discoveries,\nGalileo claimed to have seen mountains on\nthe moon, the milky way made up of tiny\nstars, and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter .\nIn his books ‘Discourse on Floating Bodies’\nand ‘Letters on the Sunspots’ , he disclosed\nhis observations of sunspots.\nUsing his own telescopes and thr ough his\nobservations on Satur n and V enus, Galileo\nargued that all the planets must orbit the Sun\nand not the earth, contrary to what was\nbelieved at that time.\nGalileo Galilei\n(1564 – 1642)\nFig. 8.6: Only the carom coin at the bottom of a\npile is removed when a fast moving carom\ncoin (or striker) hits it.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 91five-rupees coin if we use a one-rupee coin, we\nfind that a lesser force is required to  perform\nthe activity. A force that is just enough to cause\na small cart to pick up a large velocity will\nproduce a negligible change in the motion of a\ntrain. This is because, in comparison to the\ncart the train has a much lesser tendency to\nchange its state of motion. Accordingly, we say\nthat the train has more inertia than the cart.\nClearly, heavier or more massive objects offer\nlarger inertia. Quantitatively, the inertia of an\nobject is measur ed by its mass. W e may thus\nrelate inertia and mass as follows:\nInertia is the natural tendency of an object to\nresist a change in its state of motion or of\nrest. The mass of an object is a measur e of\nits inertia.\nuestions\n1.Which of the following ha s more\ninertia: (a) a rubber ball and a\nstone of the same size? (b) a\nbicycle and a train?

Why?\nObserve that a gr oove is pr ovided in a\nsaucer for placing the tea cup. It pr events\nthe cup from toppling over in case of\nsudden jerks.\n8.3Inertia and Mass\nAll the examples and activities given so far\nillustrate that ther e is a r esistance of fered by\nan object to change its state of motion. If it is\nat rest it tends to r emain at r est; if it is moving\nit tends to keep moving. This pr operty of an\nobject is called its inertia. Do all bodies have\nthe same inertia? W e know that it is easier to\npush an empty box than a box full of books.\nSimilarly, if we kick a football it flies away.\nBut if we kick a stone of the same size with\nequal for ce, it har dly moves. W e may, in fact,\nget an injury in our foot while doing so!\nSimilarly, in activity 8.2, instead of aQ\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 92 92929292its velocity changes, that is, the object gets an\nacceleration. W e would now like to study how\nthe acceleration of an object depends on the\nforce applied to it and how we measure a force.\nLet us recount some observations from our\neveryday life. During the game of table tennis\nif the ball hits a player it does not hurt him.\nOn the other hand, when a fast moving cricket\nball hits a spectator , it may hurt him. A truck\nat rest does not require any attention when\nparked along a roadside. But a moving truck,\neven at speeds as low as 5 m s–1, may kill a\nperson standing in its path. A small mass,\nsuch as a bullet may kill a person when fired\nfrom a gun. These observations suggest that\nthe impact produced by the objects depends\non their mass and velocity. Similarly, if an\nobject is to be accelerated, we know that a\ngreater force is required to give a greater\nvelocity. In other words, there appears to exist\nsome quantity of importance that combines\nthe object’s mass and its velocity. One such\nproperty called momentum was introduced by\nNewton. The momentum, p of an object is\ndefined as the product of its mass, m and\nvelocity, v. That is,\np = mv (8.1)\nMomentum has both direction and\nmagnitude. Its dir ection is the same as that\nof velocity, v. The SI unit of momentum is\nkilogram-metr\ne per second (kg m s-1). Since\nthe application of an unbalanced for ce brings\na change in the velocity of the object, it is\ntherefore clear that a for ce also pr oduces a\nchange of momentum.\nLet us consider a situation in which a car\nwith a dead battery is to be pushed along a\nstraight road to give it a speed of 1 m s-1, which\nis sufficient to start its engine. If one or two\npersons give a sudden push (unbalanced force)\nto it, it hardly starts. But a continuous push\nover some time results in a gradual acceleration\nof the car to this speed. It means that the change\nof momentum of the car is not only determined\nby the magnitude of the force but also by the\ntime during which the force is exerted. It may\nthen also be concluded that the force necessary\nto change the momentum of an object dependson the time rate at which the momentum is\nchanged.\nThe second law of motion states that the\nrate of change of momentum of an object is\nproportional to the applied unbalanced for ce\nin the direction of force.\n8.4.1 MATHEMATICAL  FORMULATION OF\nSECOND  LAW OF MOTION\nSuppose an object of mass, m is moving along\na straight line with an initial velocity, u. It is\nunifor mly accelerated to velocity, v in time, t\nby the application of a constant for ce, F\nthroughout the time, t. The initial and final\nmomentum of the object will be, p1 = mu  and\np2 = mv  r\nespectively.\nThe change in momentum ∝p2 – p1\n∝mv – mu\n∝m × (v – u).\nThe rate of change of momentum ∝( )× −m v u\nt\nOr, the applied for ce,\nF ∝ ( )× −m v u\nt\n( )× −=km v u\ntF (8.2)\n=  kma  (8.3)\nHere a ∝ = [(v – u )/t] is the acceleration,\nwhich is the rate of change of velocity. The\nquantity, k  is a constant of proportionality. The\nSI units of mass and acceleration are kg and\nm s-2 respectively. The unit of force is so\nchosen that the value of the constant, k\nbecomes one. For this, one unit of force is\ndefined as the amount that produces an\nacceleration of 1 m s-2 in an object of 1 kg mass.\nThat is,\n1 unit of force = k × (1 kg) × (1 m s-2).\nThus, the value of k becomes 1. From Eq. (8.3)\nF = ma (8.4)\nThe unit of force is kg m s-2 or newton,\nwhich has the symbol N. The second law of\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 93 9393 9393motion gives us a method to measure the force\nacting on an object as a product of its mass\nand acceleration.\nThe second law of motion is often seen in\naction in our everyday life. Have you noticed\nthat while catching a fast moving cricket ball,\na fielder in the ground gradually pulls his\nhands backwards with the moving ball? I n\ndoing so, the fielder increases the time during\nwhich the high velocity of the moving ball\ndecreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of\nthe ball is decreased and therefore the impact\nof catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 8.8) is\nalso reduced. I f the ball is stopped suddenly\nthen its high velocity decreases to zero in a\nvery short interval of time. Thus, the rate of\nchange of momentum of the ball will be large.\nTherefore, a large force would have to be\napplied for holding the catch that may hurt\nthe palm of the fielder . In a high jump athletic\nevent, the athletes are made to fall either on\na cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to\nincrease the time of the athlete’ s fall to stop\nafter making the jump. This decreases the rate\nof change of momentum and hence the force.\nTry to ponder how a karate player breaks a\nslab of ice with a single blow.The first law of motion can be\nmathematically stated from the mathematical\nexpression for the second law of motion. Eq.\n(8.4) is\nF = ma\nor F( )−=m v u\nt(8.5)\nor Ft = mv – mu\nThat is, when F = 0, v = u\n for whatever time,\nt is taken. This means that the object will\ncontinue moving with uniform velocity , u\nthroughout the time, t . If u is zero then v  will\nalso be zero. That is, the object will remain\nat rest.\nExampl ExamplExampl ExamplExampl eee ee     8.1 8.18.1 8.18.1 A constant force acts on an\nobject of mass 5 kg for a duration of\n2 s.

(8.4) we have m1 = F/a1; and\nm2 = F/a2. Here, a1 = 10 m s-2;\na2 = 20 m s-2 and F = 5 N.\nThus,  m1 = 5 N/10 m s-2 = 0.50 kg; and\nm2 = 5 N/20 m s-2 = 0.25 kg.\nIf the two masses wer e tied together ,\nthe total mass, m would be\nm = 0.50 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg.\nThe acceleration, a produced in the\ncombined mass by the 5 N for ce would\nbe, a = F/m = 5 N/0.75 kg = 6.67 m s-2.\nExampl e 8.5 The velocity-time graph of a\nball of mass 20 g moving along a\nstraight line on a long table is given in\nFig. 8.9.\nFig. 8.9\nHow much force does the table exert on\nthe ball to bring it to rest?\nSolution:\nThe initial velocity of the ball is 20 cm s-1.\nDue to the friction al force exerted by the\ntable, the velocity of the ball decr eases\ndown to zer o in 10 s.

These two forces ar e always\nequal in magnitude but opposite in dir ection.\nThese for ces act on dif ferent objects and never\non the same object. In the game of football\nsometimes we, while looking at the football\nand trying to kick it with a gr eater for ce,\ncollide with a player of the opposite team.\nBoth feel hurt because each applies a for ce\nto the other . In other wor\nds, ther e is a pair of\nforces and not just one for ce. The two\nopposing for ces ar e also known as action and\nreaction for ces.\nLet us consider two spring balances\nconnected together as shown in Fig. 8.10. The\nfixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid\nsupport, like a wall. When a for ce is applied\nthrough the fr ee end of spring balance A, it is\nobserved that both the spring balances show\nthe same r eadings on their scales. It means\nthat the for ce exerted by spring balance A on\nbalance B is equal but opposite in dir ection\nto the for ce exerted by the balance B on\nbalance A. Any of these two forces can be called\nas action  and the other as reaction . This gives\nus an alternative statement of the third law of\nmotion i.e., to every action there is an equal\nand opposite r eaction. However , it must be\nremembered that the action and reaction\nalways act on two different objects,\nsimultaneously.Fig. 8.10: Action and reaction forces are equal and\nopposite.\nSuppose you are standing at rest and\nintend to start walking on a r oad. Y ou must\naccelerate, and this r equir es a for ce in\naccor dance with the second law of motion.\nWhich is this for ce? Is it the muscular ef fort\nyou exert on the r oad? Is it in the dir ection\nwe intend to move? No, you push the r oad\nbelow backwar ds. The r oad exerts an equal\nand opposite force on your feet to make you\nmove forward.\nIt is important to note that even though\nthe action and r eaction for ces ar e always\nequal in magnitude, these for ces may not\nproduce accelerations of equal magnitudes.\nThis is because each for ce acts on a dif ferent\nobject that may have a dif ferent mass.\nWhen a gun is fir ed, it exerts a forwar d\nforce on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal\nand opposite force on the gun. This results in\nthe recoil of the gun (Fig. 8.11). Since the gun\nhas a much greater mass than the bullet, the\nacceleration of the gun is much less than the\nacceleration of the bullet. The third law of\nmotion can also be illustrated when a sailor\njumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor\njumps forward, the force on the boat moves it\nbackwards (Fig. 8.12).\nFig. 8.11: A forward force on the bullet and recoil\nof the gun.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 96What\nyou have\nlearnt\n• First law of motion: An object continues to be in a state of\nrest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless acted\nupon by an unbalanced force.\n• The natural tendency of objects to resist a change in their\nstate of rest or of uniform motion is called inertia.\n• The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia.

It is\nsaid that when Newton was sitting under a tree,\nan apple fell on him. The fall of the apple made\nNewton start thinking. He thought that: if the\nearth can attract an apple, can it not attract\nthe moon? Is the force the same in both cases?\nHe conjectured  that the same type of force is\nresponsible in both the cases. He argued that\nat each point of its orbit, the moon falls\ntowards the earth, instead of going off in a\nstraight line. So, it must be attracted by the\nearth. But we do not really see the moon falling\ntowards the earth.Let us try to understand the motion of the\nmoon by recalling activity 7.11.\nActivity ______________ 9.1\n•Take a piece of thread.\n•Tie a small stone at one end. Hold the\nother end of the thread and whirl it\nround, as shown in Fig. 9.1.\n•Note the motion of the stone.\n•Release the thread.\n•Again, note the direction of motion of\nthe stone.\nFig. 9.1: A stone describing a circular path with a\nvelocity of constant magnitude.\nBefore the thread is released, the stone\nmoves in a circular path with a certain speed\nand changes direction at every point.\nThe change in direction involves change in\nvelocity or acceleration. The force that causes\nthis acceleration and keeps the body moving\nalong the circular path is acting towards\nthe centre. This force is called the\ncentripetal (meaning ‘centre-seeking’) force.9\nGGG\nGGRAVITATIONRAVITATIONRAVITATIONRAVITATIONRAVITATIONChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGRAVITATION 1019.1.1 UNIVERSAL  LAW OF GRAVITATION\nEvery object in the universe attracts every\nother object with a for ce which is pr oportional\nto the pr oduct of their masses and inversely\nproportional to the squar e of the distance\nbetween them. The for ce is along the line\njoining the centr es of two objects.In the absence of this force, the stone flies off\nalong a straight line. This straight line will be\na tangent to the circular path.\nMore to  knowTangent to a circle\nA straight line that meets the circle at\none and only one point is called a\ntangent to the cir cle. Straight line\nABC is a tangent to the cir cle at\npoint B.\nThe motion of the moon ar ound the earth\nis due to the centripetal for ce. The centripetal\nforce is pr ovided by the for\nce of attraction of\nthe earth. If there wer e no such for ce, the\nmoon would pursue a unifor m straight line\nmotion.\nIt is seen that a falling apple is attracted\ntowar ds the earth. Does the apple attract the\nearth? If so, we do not see the earth moving\ntowar ds an apple. Why?\nAccording to the thir d law of motion, the\napple does attract the earth. But accor ding\nto the second law of motion, for a given for ce,\nacceleration is inversely pr oportional to the\nmass of an object [Eq. (8.4)]. The mass of an\napple is negligibly small compar ed to that of\nthe earth. So, we do not see the earth moving\ntowar ds the apple. Extend the same ar gument\nfor why the earth does not move towar ds the\nmoon.\nIn our solar system, all the planets go\naround the Sun. By ar guing the same way,\nwe can say that ther e exists a force between\nthe Sun and the planets. Fr om the above facts\nNewton concluded that not only does the\nearth attract an apple and the moon, but all\nobjects in the universe attract each other . This\nforce of attraction between objects is called\nthe gravitational force.G2Mm\nF =\nd\nFig. 9.2: The gravitational force between two\nuniform objects is directed along the line\njoining their centres.\nLet two objects A and B of masses M and\nm lie at a distance d from each other as shown\nin Fig. 9.2.

If\nwe do the experiment in a glass jar\nfrom which air has been sucked out,\nthe paper and the stone would fall at\nthe same rate.change in the velocity of falling objects? While\nfalling, there is no change in the direction of\nmotion of the objects. But due to the earth’s\nattraction, there will be a change in the\nmagnitude of the velocity. Any change in\nvelocity involves acceleration. Whenever an\nobject falls towar ds the earth, an acceleration\nis involved. This acceleration is due to the\nearth’s gravitational for ce. Ther efore, this\nacceleration is called the acceleration due to\nthe gravitational for ce of the earth (or\nacceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by\ng. The unit of g is the same as that of\nacceleration, that is, m s–2.\nWe know fr om the second law of motion\nthat for ce is the pr oduct of mass and\nacceleration. Let the mass of the stone in\nactivity 9.2 be m. We already know that ther e\nis acceleration involved in falling objects due\nto the gravitational for ce and is denoted by g.\nTherefor e the magnitude of the gravitational\nforce F will be equal to the pr oduct of mass\nand acceleration due to the gravitational\nforce, that is,\nF = m g (9.6)\nFrom Eqs. (9.4) and (9.6) we have\n2= G×M m\nm g\nd\nor G2M\ng =\nd(9.7)\nwhere M is the mass of the earth, and d is the\ndistance between the object and the earth.\nLet an object be on or near the sur face of\nthe earth. The distance d in Eq. (9.7) will be\nequal to R , the radius of the earth. Thus, for\nobjects on or near the sur face of the earth,\nG2M × m\nmg =\nR(9.8)\n  G2M\ng =\nR(9.9)\nThe earth is not a perfect sphere. As the\nradius of the earth increases from the poles to\nthe equator , the value of g becomes gr eater at\nthe poles than at the equator . For most\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 104We know that an object experiences\nacceleration during free fall. From Eq. (9.9),\nthis acceleration experienced by an object is\nindependent of its mass. This means that all\nobjects hollow or solid, big or small, should\nfall at the same rate. According to a story,\nGalileo dr opped dif ferent objects fr om the top\nof the Leaning T ower of Pisa in Italy to pr ove\nthe same.\nAs g is constant near the earth, all the\nequations for the unifor mly accelerated\nmotion of objects become valid with\nacceleration a replaced by g.\nThe equations are:\nv = u + at (9.10)\ns = ut + 1\n2 at2(9.11)\nv2 = u2 + 2as (9.12)\nwhere u and v are the initial and final velocities\nand s is the distance covered in    time, t.\nIn applying these equations, we will take\nacceleration, a to be positive when it is in the\ndirection of the velocity, that is, in the\ndirection of motion. The acceleration, a  will\nbe taken as negative when it opposes the\nmotion.\nExampl e 9.2 A car falls off a ledge and\ndrops to the ground in 0.5 s.

It remains the same\nwhether the object is on the earth, the moon\nor even in outer space. Thus, the mass of an\nobject is constant and does not change from\nplace to place.\n9.4Weight\nWe know that the earth attracts every object\nwith a certain force and this force depends on\nthe mass ( m) of the object and the acceleration\ndue to the gravity (g ). The weight of an object\nis the force with which it is attracted towards\nthe earth.\nWe know that\nF = m × a, (9.13)\nthat is,\nF = m × g. (9.14)\nThe force of attraction of the earth on an\nobject is known as the weight of the object. It\nis denoted by W. Substituting the same in Eq.\n(9.14), we have\nW = m × g (9.15)\nAs the weight of an object is the force with\nwhich it is attracted towards the earth, the SI\nunit of weight is the same as that of force, that\nis, newton (N). The weight is a force acting\nvertically downwards; it has both magnitude\nand direction.\nWe have lear nt that the value of g is\nconstant at a given place. Therefore at a given\nplace, the weight of an object is directly\nproportional to the mass, say m, of the object,\nthat is, W ∝ m. It is due to this reason that at\na given place, we can use the weight of an\nobject as a measure of its mass. The mass of\nan object remains the same everywhere, that\nis, on the earth and on any planet whereas its\nweight depends on its location because g\ndepends on location.\n9.4.1 WEIGHT  OF AN OBJECT ON\nTHE MOON\nWe have lear nt that the weight of an object on\nthe earth is the force with which the earthattracts the object. In the same way, the weight\nof an object on the moon is the force with\nwhich the moon attracts that object. The mass\nof the moon is less than that of the earth. Due\nto this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction\non objects.\nLet the mass of an object be m. Let its\nweight on the moon be Wm. Let the mass of\nthe moon be Mm and its radius be \nRm.\nBy applying the universal law of\ngravitation, the weight of the object on the\nmoon will be\n2G×=m\nm\nmM mW\nR(9.16)\nLet the weight of the same object on the\nearth be We.

Why an ar my tank weighing\nmore than a thousand tonne r ests upon a\ncontinuous chain? Why a truck or a motorbus\nhas much wider tyr es? Why cutting tools have\nsharp edges? In order to address these\nquestions and understand the phenomena\ninvolved, it helps  to intr oduce the conceptsof the net force in a particular direction (thrust)\nand the force per unit area (pressure) acting\non the object concerned.\nLet us try to understand the meanings of\nthrust and pr essur e by considering the\nfollowing situations:\nSituation 1:\n You wish to fix a poster on a\nbulletin board, as shown in Fig 9.3. To do this\ntask you will have to press drawing pins with\nyour thumb. Y ou apply a for ce on the sur face\narea of the head of the pin. This force is directed\nperpendicular to the surface area of the board.\nThis force acts on a smaller area at the tip of\nthe pin.\nQ\nFig. 9.3: To fix a poster , drawing pins ar e pressed\nwith the thumb perpendicular to the boar d.\nSituation 2: You stand on loose sand. Y our\nfeet go deep into the sand. Now, lie down on\nthe sand. Y ou will find that your body will not\ngo that deep in the sand. In both cases the\nforce exerted on the sand is the weight of your\nbody.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGRAVITATION 107You have lear nt that weight is the for ce\nacting vertically downwards. Here the force is\nacting perpendicular to the surface of the sand.\nThe force acting on an object perpendicular to\nthe surface is called thrust.\nWhen you stand on loose sand, the for ce,\nthat is, the weight of your body is acting on\nan ar ea equal to ar ea of your feet. When you\nlie down, the same for ce acts on an ar ea equal\nto the contact ar ea of your whole body, which\nis lar ger than the ar ea of your feet. Thus, the\neffects of for ces of the same magnitude on\ndifferent ar eas ar e different. In the above\ncases, thrust is the same. But ef fects ar e\ndifferent. Ther efore the ef fect of thrust\ndepends on the ar ea on which it acts.\nThe ef fect of thrust on sand is lar ger while\nstanding than while lying. The thrust on unit\narea is called pr\nessur e. Thus,\nthrustPressure=\narea(9.20)\nSubstituting the SI unit of thrust and area in\nEq. (9.20), we get the SI unit of pressure as N/\nm2 or N m–2.\nIn honour of scientist Blaise Pascal, the\nSI unit of pr essur e is called pascal, denoted\nas Pa.\nLet us consider a numerical example to\nunderstand the ef fects of thrust acting on\ndifferent ar\neas.\nExampl e 9.6 A block of wood is kept on a\ntabletop. The mass of wooden block is 5\nkg and its dimensions are 40 cm × 20\ncm × 10 cm. Find the pr essur e exertedby the wooden block on the table top if\nit is made to lie on the table top with its\nsides of dimensions (a) 20 cm \n× 10 cm\nand (b) 40 cm × 20 cm.\nSolution:\nThe mass of the wooden block = 5 kg\nThe dimensions\n= 40 cm ×  20 cm ×  10 cm\nHere, the weight of the wooden block\napplies a thrust on the table top.\nThat is,\n  Thrust = F = m × g\n=5 kg × 9.8 m s–2\n=49 N\nArea of a side = length × breadth\n=20 cm × 10 cm\n=200 cm2 = 0.02 m2\nFrom Eq.

(9.20),\nPressur e = 249 N\n0.08 m\n=612.5 N m–2\nThe pr essur e exerted by the side 20 cm\n× 10 cm is 2450 N m–2 and by the side\n40 cm × 20 cm is 612.5 N m–2.\nThus, the same for ce acting on a smaller\narea exerts a larger pressure, and a smaller\npressure on a larger area. This is the reason\nwhy a nail has a pointed tip, knives have sharp\nedges and buildings have wide foundations.\n9.5.1 PRESSURE  IN FLUIDS\nAll liquids and gases are fluids. A solid exerts\npressur e on a sur face due to its weight.\nSimilarly, fluids have weight, and they also Fig. 9.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 108water on the bottle is greater than its weight.\nTherefore it rises up when released.\nTo keep the bottle completely immersed,\nthe upwar d force on the bottle due to water\nmust be balanced. This can be achieved by\nan exter nally applied for ce acting downwar ds.\nThis for ce must at least be equal to the\ndiffer\nence between the upwar d force and the\nweight of the bottle.\nThe upwar d force exerted by the water on\nthe bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant\nforce. In fact, all objects experience a for ce of\nbuoyancy when they ar e immersed in a fluid.\nThe magnitude of this buoyant for ce depends\non the density of the fluid.\n9.5.3 WHY OBJECTS  FLOAT  OR SINK\nWHEN  PLACED ON THE SURFACE  OF\nWATER ?\nLet us do the following activities to arrive at\nan answer for the above question.\nActivity ______________ 9.5\n•Take a beaker filled with water .\n•Take an ir on nail and place it on the\nsurface of the water .\n•Observe what happens.\nThe nail sinks. The for ce due to the\ngravitational attraction of the earth on the\niron nail pulls it downwar ds. Ther e is an\nupthrust of water on the nail, which pushes\nit upwards. But the downwar d force acting\non the nail is greater than the upthrust of\nwater on the nail. So it sinks (Fig. 9.5).exert pressure on the base and walls of the\ncontainer in which they are enclosed. Pressure\nexerted in any confined mass of fluid is\ntransmitted undiminished in all directions.\n9.5.2 BUOYANCY\nHave you ever had a swim in a pool and felt\nlighter? Have you ever drawn water fr om a\nwell and felt that the bucket of water is heavier\nwhen it is out of the water? Have you ever\nwonder ed why a ship made of iron and steel\ndoes not sink in sea water , but while the same\namount of ir on and steel in the for m of a sheet\nwould sink? These questions can be answer ed\nby taking buoyancy in consideration. Let us\nunderstand the meaning of buoyancy by\ndoing an activity.\nActivity ______________ 9.4\n•Take an empty plastic bottle. Close\nthe mouth of the bottle with an\nairtight stopper . Put it in a bucket\nfilled with water . You see that the\nbottle floats.\n•Push the bottle into the water . You feel\nan upwar d push. T ry to push it further\ndown. Y ou will find it dif ficult to push\ndeeper and deeper . This indicates that\nwater exerts a for ce on the bottle in the\nupwar d dir ection. The upwar d for ce\nexerted by the water goes on incr easing\nas the bottle is pushed deeper  till it is\ncompletely immersed.\n•Now, r elease the  bottle. It bounces\nback to the sur face.\n•Does the for ce due to the gravitational\nattraction of the earth act on this\nbottle? If so, why doesn’t the bottle stay\nimmersed in water after it is r eleased?\nHow can you immerse the bottle in\nwater?\nThe for ce due to the gravitational\nattraction of the earth acts on the bottle in\nthe downwar d dir ection. So the bottle is\npulled downwar ds. But the water exerts an\nupward force on the bottle. Thus, the bottle is\npushed upwards. W e have lear nt that weight\nof an object is the force due to gravitational\nattraction of the earth. When the bottle is\nimmersed, the upward force exerted by theFig. 9.5: An iron nail sinks and a cork floats when\nplaced on the sur face of water .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGRAVITATION 109•Observe what happens to  elongation\nof the string or the r eading on the\nbalance.\nYou will find that the elongation of the string\nor the reading of the balance decreases as the\nstone is gradually lower ed in the water . However ,\nno further change is observed once the stone\ngets fully immersed in the water . What do you\ninfer from the decrease in the extension of the\nstring or the reading of the spring balance?\nWe know that the elongation pr oduced in\nthe string or the spring balance is due to the\nweight of the stone. Since the extension\ndecreases once the stone is lower ed in water ,\nit means that some force acts on the stone in\nupward direction. As a result, the net force on\nthe string decreases and hence the elongation\nalso decr eases. As discussed earlier , this\nupward force exerted by water is known as\nthe force of buoyancy.\nWhat is the magnitude of the buoyant\nforce experienced by a body? Is it the same\nin all fluids for a given body? Do all bodies\nin a given fluid experience the same buoyant\nforce? The answer to these questions is\ncontained in Archimedes’ principle, stated as\nfollows:Activity ______________ 9.6\n•Take a beaker filled with water .\n•Take a piece of cork and an ir on nail of\nequal mass.\n•Place them on the sur face of water .\n•Observe what happens.\nThe cork floats while the nail sinks. This\nhappens because of the dif ference in their\ndensities. The density of a substance is\ndefined as the mass per unit volume. The\ndensity of cork is less than the density of\nwater . This means that the upthrust of water\non the cork is gr eater than the weight of the\ncork. So it floats (Fig. 9.5).\nThe density of an iron nail is more than\nthe density of water . This means that the\nupthrust of water on the ir on nail is less than\nthe weight of the nail. So it sinks.\nTherefore objects of density less than that\nof a liquid float on the liquid. The objects of\ndensity gr eater than that of a liquid sink in\nthe liquid.\nuestions\n1.Why is it dif ficult to hold a school\nbag having a strap made of a thin\nand str ong string?\n2.What do you mean by buoyancy?\n3.Why does an object float or sink\nwhen placed on the sur face of\nwater?\n9.6Archimedes’ Principle\nActivity ______________ 9.7\n•Take a piece of stone and tie it to one\nend of a rubber string or a spring\nbalance.\n•Suspend the stone by holding the\nbalance or the string as shown in\nFig. 9.6 (a).\n• Note the elongation of the string or\nthe reading on the spring balance due\nto the weight of the stone.\n•Now, slowly dip the stone in the water\nin a container as shown in\nFig. 9.6 (b).\nFig. 9.6: (a) Observe the elongation of the rubber\nstring due to the weight of a piece of stone\nsuspended fr om it in air . (b) The elongation\ndecreases as the stone is immersed\nin water .(a)\n(b)\nQ\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 110What\nyou have\nlearnt\n• The law of gravitation states that the force of attraction\nbetween any two objects is proportional to the product of\ntheir masses and inversely proportional to the square of\nthe distance between them.  The law applies to objects\nanywhere in the universe.  Such a law is said to be universal.\n• Gravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved.\n• The force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies\non the surface of the earth, decreasing from poles to the\nequator .\n• The weight of a body is the for ce with which the earth\nattracts it.\n• The weight is equal to the pr oduct of mass and acceleration\ndue to gravity.\n• The weight may vary from place to place but the mass stays\nconstant.When a body is immersed fully or partially\nin a fluid, it experiences an upward force that\nis equal to the weight of the fluid displaced\nby it.\nNow, can you explain why a further\ndecrease in the elongation of the string was\nnot observed in activity 9.7, as the stone was\nfully immersed in water?\nArchimedes was a Greek scientist. He\ndiscovered the principle, subsequently named\nafter him, after noticing that\nthe water in a bathtub\noverflowed when he stepped\ninto it. He ran through the\nstreets shouting “Eureka!”,\nwhich means “I have got it”.\nThis knowledge helped him to\ndetermine the purity of the\ngold in the crown made for\nthe king.\nHis work in the field of Geometry and\nMechanics made him famous. His\nunderstanding of levers, pulleys, wheels-\nand-axle helped the Greek army in its war\nwith Roman army.\nArchimedesQArchimedes’ principle has many\napplications. It is used in designing ships and\nsubmarines. Lactometers, which are used to\ndetermine the purity of a sample of milk and\nhydrometers used for determining density of\nliquids, are based on this principle.\nuestions\n1.You find your mass to be 42 kg\non a weighing machine.
